# Adjust inventory with barcodes

An *inventory adjustment*, or inventory audit, is the process of
verifying the physical stock of products against the quantities recorded
in the database. Regular audits ensure accurate inventory records,
prevent stock discrepancies, and maintain efficient operations. In a
warehouse setting, managers typically assign inventory counts to
employees, who then walk to designated locations, scan product barcodes,
and adjust quantities as needed.

Inventory adjustments can be completed through the **Barcode**
application using a compatible scanner, or the Odoo mobile app.

Odoo\'s **Barcode** application provides demo data with barcodes to
explore the features of the app. These can be used for testing purposes,
and can be printed from the home screen of the app.

To access this demo data, navigate to the
`Barcode app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and click `demo
data sheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`barcodes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the banner above the
scanner.

## Assigning inventory counts

Before performing an inventory count, managers can
`assign <inventory/plan-counts>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} counting
tasks to employees. This can be done through
`Inventory app --> Operations -->
Physical Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} by selecting
specific locations and products for counting, and assigning a
`User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to them. Once assigned, users
will see pending counts when they open the **Barcode** app.

To view a requested inventory count, navigate to the
`Barcode app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} dashboard. If a
count has been requested, the number of products to be counted is listed
on the `Inventory
count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![The Barcode dashboard with an assigned count.](adjustments/assigned-count.png)

## Configuration

Before an inventory adjustment can be performed with the **Barcode**
app, the app has to be installed, and configured. Navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and scroll to the
`Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Tick the checkbox
next to `Barcode Scanner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save any changes. If
necessary, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
pop-up.

:::: danger
::: title
Danger
:::

Enabling the **Barcode** feature requires installing the **Barcode**
application. Installing a new application on a One-App-Free database
triggers a fifteen-day trial. At the end of the trial, if a paid
subscription has not been added to the database, it will no longer be
accessible.
::::

After saving, a new drop-down menu appears under the
`Barcode Scanner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, labeled
`Barcode Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, where either
`Default Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Default GS1 Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be
selected. Each nomenclature option determines how scanners interpret
barcodes in Odoo.

To count products using barcodes, ensure that barcodes for products and
storage locations are set up within Odoo first. Refer to this section
for detailed instructions: `Set Product Barcodes
<inventory/barcode/set-barcodes>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

![Enabled Barcode feature in Inventory app settings.](adjustments/adjustments-barcode-setting.png)

## Performing an inventory count {#inventory/barcode/perform-count}

To perform an inventory adjustment, first navigate to the
`Barcode app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. If assigned
counts exist, tap `Inventory Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to view pending tasks.

![Barcode app start screen with scanner.](adjustments/adjustments-barcode-scanner.png)

Walk to the designated storage location, then scan the location barcode.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If the warehouse *multi-location* feature is **not** enabled in the
database, a source location does not need to be scanned. Instead, scan
the product barcode to start the inventory adjustment.
::::

Doing so highlights the location and displays all of the products stored
there. Scan the barcode of each product to adjust its count.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If no counts have been assigned to a user, and the
`Count Entire Locations
<inventory/barcode/count-location>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
feature is **not** enabled, no products may appear after the location
barcode is scanned.
::::

Manually adjust quantities if necessary by tapping the
`fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(edit)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon. Doing so opens a separate window with a keypad.
Edit the number in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
line to change the quantity. Additionally, the `+1`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `-1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons can
be clicked to add or subtract quantity of the product, and the number
keys can be used to add quantity, as well.

::: example
In the below inventory adjustment, the source location [WH/Stock/Shelf
1]{.title-ref} was scanned, assigning the location. Then, the barcode
for the product [\[FURN_7888\] Desk Stand with Screen]{.title-ref} was
scanned three times, increasing the units in the adjustment. Additional
products can be added to this adjustment by scanning the barcodes for
those specific products.

![Barcode Inventory Client Action page with inventory adjustment.](adjustments/adjustments-barcode-inventory-client-action.png)
:::

### Count entire locations {#inventory/barcode/count-location}

The `Count Entire Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature
assigns a user to count all the products within a location once they
scan the barcode for that location. This allows for easier cycle counts
by assigning an entire location to a user by assigning a single product
count. During cycle counts, users can ensure accurate inventory numbers,
see if products that should be in a location are missing, or discover
products incorrectly stored within a location.

To enable this feature, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and scroll to the `Barcode`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section. Tick the
`Count Entire Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox,
then click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

This setting is only visible if the
`Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox is
ticked.
::::

To perform an inventory count of an entire location, navigate to
`Barcode app -->
Inventory Count`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Scan the
desired location barcode. The app then displays all assigned products in
that location.
`Proceed with the count <inventory/barcode/perform-count>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} as normal.

### Show quantity to count

When conducting an inventory count, the expected quantity of products is
displayed by default, to provide the user with a baseline to use when
performing the count. However, as this can result in users relying on
this count instead of performing a new count, this quantity can be
hidden.

Navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. In the `Barcode`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, clear the
`Show Quantity to Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox,
then click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![An inventory count without the show quantity to count feature enabled.](adjustments/show-quantity-to-count-disabled.png)

## Manually add products to an inventory count

When barcodes for location or products are not available, Odoo
**Barcode** can still be used to perform inventory counts.

To do this, navigate to the
`Barcode app --> Inventory Count`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

To manually add products to this adjustment, click the white
`Add Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the bottom of
the screen.

This navigates to a new, blank page where the desired product, quantity,
and source location must be chosen.

![Keypad to add products on Barcode Inventory Client Action page.](adjustments/adjustments-keypad.png)

First, click the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line, and
choose the product whose stock count should be adjusted. Then, manually
enter the quantity of that product, either by changing the
[1]{.title-ref} in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
line, or by clicking the `+1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`-1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons to add or subtract
quantity of the product. The number pad can be used to add quantity, as
well.

Below the number pad is the `location`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} line, which should read [WH/Stock]{.title-ref} by
default. Click this line to reveal a drop-down menu of locations to
choose from, and choose the `source location`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for this inventory adjustment.

Click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the
changes.

## Finalizing an inventory count

After counting all of the products, review the entries to ensure all the
counted quantities are accurately entered. To complete the inventory
adjustment, click `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} barcode can be scanned
in place of clicking the `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button.
::::

Odoo then navigates back to the `Barcode Scanning`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} screen. A small green banner appears in the top-right
corner, confirming the inventory count has been updated.

# Default barcode nomenclature

*Barcode nomenclatures* define how barcodes are recognized and
categorized. When a barcode is scanned, it is associated to the
**first** rule with a matching pattern. The pattern syntax is described
in Odoo\'s nomenclature list using a regular expression, and a barcode
is successfully read by Odoo if its prefix and/or length matches the one
defined in the barcode\'s rule.

For instance, at a
`Point of Sale <../../../sales/point_of_sale>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} station, product weight barcodes in the European Article
Number (EAN) format, which begin with [21]{.title-ref} and have five
digits specifying the weight, are used to weigh products and generate a
barcode depicting the weight and price. The [21]{.title-ref} and
five-digit weight is the barcode pattern used to identify the barcode
and can be customized to ensure Odoo correctly interprets all barcodes
for the business.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Barcodes are also commonly used with Odoo\'s **Inventory** and
**Barcode** apps.
::::

Odoo **Barcode** supports
`EAN (European Article Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
Universal Product Code (UPC), and
`GS1 <gs1_nomenclature>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} formats. This
document exclusively focuses on `default rules and patterns in Odoo
<barcode/operations/default-nomenclature-list>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, which use `UPC (Universal Product Code)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and `EAN (European Article Number)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} encoding.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To use `UPC (Universal Product Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
`EAN (European Article Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} barcodes
for uniquely identifying products across the entire supply chain, they
**must** be [purchased from
GS1](https://www.gs1.org/standards/get-barcodes).

In Odoo, custom barcode patterns can be defined to recognize barcodes
specific to the company. Barcodes do not need to be purchased if used
only within the company, such as in the
`example <barcode/operations/product-weight>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} where the barcode is written in the
`EAN (European Article Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} format.
::::

## Configuration

To use default nomenclature, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Under the
`Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, tick the
`Barcode Scanner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox. Doing so
installs the **Barcode** app in the database.

Next, in the `Barcode Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, ensure `Default Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
is selected. Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Enabled barcode setting with Default Nomenclature selected.](barcode_nomenclature/enable-nomenclature.png){.align-center}

With the **Barcode** module installed, and the
`Default Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} selected, the
barcode actions using `UPC (Universal Product Code)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and `EAN (European Article Number)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, detailed in the `default nomenclature list
<barcode/operations/default-nomenclature-list>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, are available for use. And, by default, Odoo automatically
handles `UPC (Universal Product Code)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}/`EAN (European Article Number)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} conversion.

## Example: product weight barcode {#barcode/operations/product-weight}

To better understand how barcode nomenclature is used to identify
products in Odoo, this example where product weight barcodes in
`EAN (European Article Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} format
are used to allow a `Point of Sale
<../../../sales/point_of_sale>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} business
to automatically print barcodes, and calculate the price using the
weight of the item.

To set up barcodes for weighted products, the following rule is used:

  Rule Name                      Barcode Pattern    Field in Odoo
  ------------------------------ ------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------
  Weighted Barcodes 3 Decimals   (21)\....{NNDDD}   `Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on product form

::: example
To better understand the barcode pattern for weighted products, consider
the barcode, \`2112345000008\`:

- \`21\`: code that identifies this a barcode for weighted products.
- \`12345\`: five digits (denoted by [\.....]{.title-ref} in the table
  above) that identify the product.
- \`00000\`: five digits (denoted by [{NNDDD}]{.title-ref} in the table)
  representing the weight of the product. On the product form, the five
  weight values **must** be [00000]{.title-ref}. The first two digits
  are whole number values, and the last three digits are decimal values.
  For example, \"13.5 grams\" in the [{NNDDD}]{.title-ref} format is
  [13500]{.title-ref}.
- \`8\`: [check
  digit](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator) for
  [211234500000]{.title-ref}.

Together, these components make up a 13-character
`EAN (European Article Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} - 13
barcode.
:::

To configure the product barcode for [Pasta Bolognese]{.title-ref}, the
`EAN (European Article Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} barcode
for weighted products, [2112345000008]{.title-ref}, is entered in the
`Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the product form
(accessible by going to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and selecting the desired product). In addition,
the `Unit of Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
`kg`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Barcode field on the product form.](barcode_nomenclature/barcode.png){.align-center}

Next, a customer\'s bowl of pasta is weighed to be [1.5]{.title-ref}
kilograms. This generates a new barcode for the pasta, according to the
weight: [211234501500]{.title-ref}, which has a check digit of
[2]{.title-ref}. The new barcode is [2112345015002]{.title-ref}.

![Generated barcode that includes a weight of 1.5 kg.](barcode_nomenclature/weighted-barcode.png){.align-center}

Ensure the products scan properly, by navigating to the
`Barcode app --> Operations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Next, click any operation type, such as `Receipts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to create a draft stock move. Scan the product
weight barcode, such as [2112345015002]{.title-ref}, and if the intended
product appears, the barcode setup is correct.

![Show successfully scanned barcode.](barcode_nomenclature/barcode-scan.png){.align-center}

## Create rules

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Adding new rules is necessary for
`UPC (Universal Product Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
`EAN (European Article Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} formats
that are **not** in Odoo\'s default list, since barcodes cannot be read
successfully if there are unknown fields.

While new rules can be created, Odoo fields do **not** auto-populate
with information from these rules. [Custom
development](https://www.odoo.com/appointment/132) is required for this
functionality.
::::

To create a rule, first enable
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Then,
navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Barcode Nomenclatures`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select
`Default Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

On this page, configure the following optional fields:

- `UPC/EAN Conversion`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: determines if
  a `UPC (Universal Product Code)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"}/`EAN (European Article Number)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} barcode should be automatically converted when matching a
  rule with another encoding. Options include `Always`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} (the default option), `Never`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `EAN-13 to UPC-A`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, and `UPC-A to EAN-13`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- `Is GS1 Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: ensure this
  checkbox is **not** ticked, as the
  `Default Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} uses
  `UPC (Universal Product Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
  `EAN (European Article Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  encoding, *not* GS1 encoding.

![Default Nomenclature page setting fields.](barcode_nomenclature/rule-config.png){.align-center}

On the `Default Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page,
click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the bottom of
the table, which opens a `Create Rules`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window to create a new rule.

The `Rule Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is used
internally to identify what the barcode represents.

The `Sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field represents the
priority of the rule; meaning the smaller the value, the higher the rule
appears on the table.

The barcode `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field represents
different classifications of information that can be understood by the
system (e.g., `Package`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Lot`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Location`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Coupon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, etc.).

The `Encoding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field specifies which
encoding the barcode uses. This rule **only** applies if the barcode
uses this specific encoding. The available `Encoding`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} options are: `EAN-13`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `EAN-8`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`UPC-A`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`GS1-28`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The `Barcode Pattern`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
represents how the sequence of letters or numbers is recognized by the
system to contain information about the product. Sometimes, when a
certain amount of digits are required, the number of [.]{.title-ref} is
shown. [N]{.title-ref} represents whole number digits, and
[D]{.title-ref} represent decimal digits.

::: example
[1\...]{.title-ref} represents any 4-digit number that starts with 1.
[NNDD]{.title-ref} represents a two digit number with two decimal
points. For example, [14.25]{.title-ref} is 1425.
:::

After filling in the information, click the
`Save & New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to save the rule,
and instantly start creating another rule. Or, click
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the rule, and
return to the table of rules.

## Default nomenclature list {#barcode/operations/default-nomenclature-list}

The table below contains Odoo\'s list of
`Default Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} rules. Barcode
patterns are written in regular expressions.

  Rule Name                     Type                 Encoding   Barcode Pattern

# GS1 barcode nomenclature

::: {#barcode/operations/gs1}
:::

[GS1 nomenclature](https://www.gs1us.org/) consolidates various product
and supply chain data into a single barcode. Odoo takes in [unique
Global Trade Item Numbers](https://www.gs1.org/standards/get-barcodes)
(GTIN), purchased by businesses, to enable global shipping, sales, and
eCommerce product listing.

Configure GS1 nomenclature to scan barcodes of sealed boxes and identify
essential product information, such as
`GTIN (Global Trade Item Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, lot
number, quantity information, and more.

:::: important
::: title

## Set up barcode nomenclature {#barcode/operations/set-up-barcode-nomenclature}

To use GS1 nomenclature, navigate to the
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Then under the
`Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, check the
`Barcode Scanner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box. Next, select
`Barcode Nomenclature --> Default GS1 Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} from the default barcode nomenclature options.

![Choose GS1 from dropdown and click the external link to see the list of GS1 rules.](gs1_nomenclature/setup-gs1-nomenclature.png){.align-center}

The list of GS1 *rules* and *barcode patterns* Odoo supports by default
is accessible by clicking the `➡️ (arrow)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon to the right of the
`Barcode Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} selection.

In the `Open: Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
table, view and edit the GS1 `Rule Names`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} available in Odoo. The table contains all the
information that can be condensed with a GS1 barcode, along with the
corresponding `Barcode Pattern`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

After setting GS1 as the barcode nomenclature, the
`Barcode Nomenclatures`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} settings
can also be accessed by a hidden menu that\'s discoverable after
enabling `developer
mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Once enabled,
navigate to the `Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Barcode Nomenclatures`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} menu and finally, select `Default GS1
Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

## Use GS1 barcodes in Odoo {#barcode/operations/create-GS1-barcode}

For product identification using GS1 barcodes in Odoo, businesses obtain
a [unique GTIN](https://www.gs1.org/standards/get-barcodes) as an
internationally distinct product identifier purchased from GS1. This
`GTIN (Global Trade Item Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
combined with specific product details following GS1\'s designated
*barcode pattern*. The barcode pattern\'s arrangement of numbers and
letters must adhere to GS1 conventions for accurate interpretation by
global systems along the supply chain.

Every barcode starts with a 2-4 digit [application
identifier](https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes/application-identifiers)
(A.I.). This required prefix universally indicates what kind of
information the barcode contains. Odoo follows GS1 rules for identifying
information, as detailed in the `default GS1 rules list
<barcode/operations/default-gs1-nomenclature-list>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Including the relevant
`A.I. (Application Identifier)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} from the
list enables Odoo to correctly interpret GS1 barcodes. While most
barcode patterns have a fixed length requirement, certain ones, such as
lots and serial numbers, have flexible length.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

For flexible-length barcode patterns not placed at the end of the GS1
barcode, use the FNC1 separator ([x1D]{.title-ref}) to end the barcode.

Example: The barcode pattern for lot numbers is 20 characters long.
Instead of creating a 20-character lot number barcode, like
[LOT00000000000000001]{.title-ref}, use the FNC1 separator to make it
shorter: [LOT001x1D]{.title-ref}.
::::

Refer to the
`GS1 nomenclature list <barcode/operations/default-gs1-nomenclature-list>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to see a comprehensive list of all barcode patterns and
rules to follow. Otherwise, refer to `this
GS1 usage doc <barcode/operations/gs1_usage>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for specific examples of combining
`GTIN (Global Trade Item Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
product information and configuring the workflow.

role="ref"} -
`Non-unit quantities workflow <barcode/operations/quantity-ex>`{.interpreted-text

:::

### Create rules {#barcode/operations/create-new-rules}

GS1 rules are a specific format of information contained in the barcode,
beginning with an `A.I. (Application Identifier)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and containing a defined length of characters. Scanning GS1
barcodes from the `default GS1 list
<barcode/operations/default-gs1-nomenclature-list>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} auto-fills corresponding data in the Odoo database.

Adding GS1 barcode rules in Odoo ensures accurate interpretation of
unique, non-standard GS1 formats.

To do so, begin by turning on
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
navigating to the `Barcode Nomenclatures`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} list in `Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Barcode Nomenclatures`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Then,
select the `Default GS1 Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
list item.

On the `Default GS1 Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
page, select `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the
bottom of the table, which opens a window to create a new rule. The
`Rule Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is used internally
to identify what the barcode represents. The barcode
`Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are different classifications
of information that can be understood by the system (e.g. product,
quantity, best before date, package, coupon). The
`Sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} represents the priority of
the rule; this means the smaller the value, the higher the rule appears
on the table. Odoo follows the sequential order of this table and will
use the first rule it matches based on the sequence. The `Barcode
Pattern`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is how the sequence of
letters or numbers is recognized by the system to contain information
about the product.

After filling in the information, click the
`Save & New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to make another
rule or click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save
and return to the table of rules.

## Barcode troubleshooting {#barcode/operations/troubleshooting}

Since GS1 barcodes are challenging to work with, here are some checks to
try when the barcodes are not working as expected:

1.  Ensure that the `Barcode Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} setting is set as `Default GS1
    Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Jump to the
    `nomenclature setup section
    <barcode/operations/set-up-barcode-nomenclature>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} for more details.

2.  Ensure that the fields scanned in the barcode are enabled in Odoo.
    For example, to scan a barcode containing lots and serial numbers,
    make sure the `Lots & Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} feature is enabled in
    `Odoo's settings <barcode/operations/lot-setup>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and `on the product
    <barcode/operations/lot-setup-on-product>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

3.  Omit punctuation such as parentheses [()]{.title-ref} or brackets
    [\[\]]{.title-ref} between the `A.I. (Application
    Identifier)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and the barcode
    sequence. These are typically used in examples for ease of reading
    and should **not** be included in the final barcode. For more
    details on building GS1 barcodes, go to
    `this section <barcode/operations/create-GS1-barcode>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

4.  When a single barcode contains multiple encoded fields, Odoo
    requires all rules to be listed in the barcode nomenclature for Odoo
    to read the barcode. `This section
    <barcode/operations/create-new-rules>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    details how to add new rules in the barcode nomenclature.

5.  Test barcodes containing multiple encoded fields, piece by piece, to
    figure out which field is causing the issue.

    ::: example
    When testing a barcode containing the
    `GTIN (Global Trade Item Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
    lot number, and quantity, start by scanning the
    `GTIN (Global Trade Item Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
    alone. Then, test the
    `GTIN (Global Trade Item Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
    with the lot number, and finally, try scanning the whole barcode.
    :::

6.  After diagnosing the encoded field is unknown, `add new rules
    <barcode/operations/create-new-rules>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    to Odoo\'s default list to recognize GS1 barcodes with unique
    specifications.

    :::: important
    ::: title
    Important
    :::

    While the new field will be read, the information won\'t link to an
    existing field in Odoo without developer customizations. However,
    adding new rules is necessary to ensure the rest of the fields in
    the barcode are interpreted correctly.
    ::::

## GS1 nomenclature list {#barcode/operations/default-gs1-nomenclature-list}

The table below contains Odoo\'s default list of GS1 rules. Barcode
patterns are written in regular expressions. Only the first three rules
require a [check
digit](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator) as the final
character.

# GS1 barcode usage

::: {#barcode/operations/gs1_usage}
:::

GS1 barcodes provide a standardized format that barcode scanners can
interpret. They encode information in a
`specific structure recognized globally <barcode/operations/gs1>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, allowing scanners to understand and process supply chain
data consistently.

Odoo *Barcode* interprets and prints GS1 barcodes, automating product
identification and tracking in warehouse operations such as receiving,
picking, and shipping.

The following sections contain examples of how Odoo uses GS1 barcodes
provided by the business to identify common warehouse items and automate
certain warehouse workflows.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo **does not** create GS1 barcodes. Businesses must purchase a unique
Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) from GS1. Then, they can combine their
existing GS1 barcodes with product and supply chain information (also
provided by GS1) to create barcodes in Odoo.

## Configure barcodes for product, quantity, and lots {#barcode/operations/gs1-lots}

To build a GS1 barcode that contains information about a product, its
quantities, and the lot number, the following barcode patterns and
Application Identifiers (A.I.) are used:

### Configuration {#barcode/operations/lot-setup}

First,
`enable product tracking using lots <inventory/management/track_products_by_lots>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} by navigating to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and checking the box for
`Lots & Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under the
`Traceability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading.

Then, set up the product barcode by navigating to the intended product
form in `Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and selecting the product. On the product form,
click `Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, in the
`General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, fill in
the `Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field with the unique
14-digit [Global Trade Item Number
(GTIN)](https://www.gs1.org/standards/get-barcodes), which is a
universally recognized identifying number that is provided by GS1.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

On the product form, omit the
`A.I. (Application Identifier)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
[01]{.title-ref} for `GTIN (Global Trade Item Number)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} product barcode pattern, as it is only used to encode
multiple barcodes into a single barcode that contains detailed
information about the package contents.
::::

::: example
To record the GS1 barcode for the product, [Fuji Apple]{.title-ref},
enter the 14-digit `GTIN (Global Trade Item Number)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} [20611628936004]{.title-ref} in the
`Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the product form.

![Enter 14-digit GTIN into the Barcode field on product form.](gs1_usage/barcode-field.png){.align-center}
:::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To view a list of *all* products and their corresponding barcodes in the
Odoo database, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Under the `Barcode`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} heading, click on the
`Configure Product Barcodes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
under the `Barcode
Scanner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Enter the 14-digit
`GTIN (Global Trade Item Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} into
the `Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, then click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![View the Product Barcodes page from inventory settings.](gs1_usage/product-barcodes-page.png){.align-center}

::: {#barcode/operations/lot-setup-on-product}
After activating tracking by lots and serial numbers from the settings
page, specify that this feature is to be applied on each product by
navigating to the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on
the product form. Under `Tracking`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
choose the `By Lots`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} radio button.

![Enable product tracking by lots in the \"Inventory\" tab of the product form.](gs1_usage/track-by-lots.png){.align-center}

### Scan barcode on receipt

To ensure accurate lot interpretation in Odoo on product barcodes
scanned during a receipt operation, navigate to the
`Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app to manage the
`receipt picking process
<barcode/operations/scan-received-products>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

From the `Barcode Scanning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
dashboard, click the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button, then the `Receipts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
view the list of vendor receipts to process. Receipts generated from
`POs (Purchase Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are listed, but
new receipt operations can also be created directly through the
`Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app using the
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

On the list of receipts, click on the warehouse operation
([WH/IN]{.title-ref}) and scan product barcodes and lot numbers with a
barcode scanner. The scanned product then appears on the list. Use the
`✏️ (pencil)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to open a window
and manually enter quantities for specific lot numbers.

::: example
After placing a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for
fifty apples, navigate to the associated receipt in the *Barcode* app.

Scan the barcode containing the
`GTIN (Global Trade Item Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
quantity, and lot number. For testing with a barcode scanner, below is
an example barcode for the fifty Fuji apples in Lot 2.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Verify product moves

For additional verification, the quantities of received products are
also recorded on the `Product Moves`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
report, accessible by navigating to `Inventory app -->
Reporting --> Product Moves`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

The items on the `Product Moves`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
report are grouped by product by default. To confirm the received
quantities, click on a product line to open its collapsible drop-down
menu, which displays a list of *stock move lines* for the product. The
latest stock move matches the warehouse reception reference number (e.g.
[WH/IN/00013]{.title-ref}) and quantity processed in the barcode scan,
demonstrating that the records processed in the *Barcode* app were
properly stored in *Inventory*.

# Process batch transfers

The Odoo **Barcode** app can be used to process *Batch*, *Wave*, and
*Cluster* transfers that are created in the **Inventory** app.

::: seealso
This document covers the steps to process transfers in the **Barcode**
app. Instructions on creating transfers can be found below:

- `../../inventory/shipping_receiving/picking_methods/batch`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}
- `../../inventory/shipping_receiving/picking_methods/wave`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}
- `../../inventory/shipping_receiving/picking_methods/cluster`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}
:::

## Process the batch

First, navigate to `Barcode app --> Operations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select an operation type (like delivery
orders) grouped into batches. From here, select the card for the
appropriate batch transfer, and click the `BATCH`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button.

![The Delivery Orders page.](process_transfers/batch-transfer.png)

On the batch transfer screen, the products in the picking are grouped by
location, and each line is color-coded to associate products in the same
picking together.

Then, follow the prompt to `Scan the source location`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} barcode for the storage location of the first product.
Scan the barcode for the product and package to process the transfer. To
record multiple quantities, click the `fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(edit)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, and enter
the required quantities for the picking.

Repeat this for all products, and click the `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to mark the transfer as `Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

After creating a batch transfer and assigning a package to a picking,
Odoo suggests the specified package by displaying the name *in italics*
under the product name, ensuring pickers place products into the correct
boxes.

Products from the same order are labeled with the same color on the
left. Completed pickings are highlighted in green.
::::

::: example
In a batch transfer for 2 [Cabinet with Doors]{.title-ref}, 3 [Acoustic
Bloc Screens]{.title-ref}, and 4 [Four Person Desks]{.title-ref}, the
[3/3]{.title-ref} and [4/4]{.title-ref} `Units`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} indicate that the last two product pickings are
complete.

[1/2]{.title-ref} units of the [Cabinet with Doors]{.title-ref} has
already been picked, and after scanning the product barcode for the
second cabinet, Odoo prompts the user to [Scan a serial
number]{.title-ref} to record the unique serial number for
`product tracking <inventory/product_management/enable-lots>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

# Process receipts and deliveries with barcodes

::: {#barcode/operations/intro}
The *Barcode* app can be used to process receipts, deliveries, and other
types of operations in real time using a barcode scanner or the Odoo
mobile app.
:::

This makes it possible to process operations on the warehouse floor when
they happen, instead of having to wait to validate transfers from a
computer. Processing operations this way can help to properly attribute
barcodes to the appropriate products, pickings, locations, and more.

## Enable Barcode app

To use the *Barcode* app to process transfers, it must be installed by
enabling the feature from the settings of the *Inventory* app.

To do so, go to the
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, scroll down to the
`Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and click the
checkbox next to the `Barcode Scanner`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} feature.

Once the checkbox is ticked, click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} at the top of the page to save changes.

Once the page has refreshed, new options will be displayed under the
`Barcode Scanner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature:
`Barcode Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (with a
corresponding drop-down menu), where either
`Default Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Default GS1 Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be
selected.

There is also a `Configure Product Barcodes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} internal link arrow, and a set of
`Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons for printing barcode
commands and a barcode demo sheet.

![Enabled Barcode feature in Inventory app settings.](receipts_deliveries/receipts-deliveries-barcode-setting.png){.align-center}

For more on setting up and configuring the `Barcode`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} app, refer to the `Set up your
barcode scanner <../setup/hardware>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
`Activate the Barcodes in Odoo <../setup/software>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation pages.

## Scan barcodes for receipts {#barcode/operations/scan-received-products}

To process warehouse receipts for incoming products, there first needs
to be a purchase order (PO) created, and a receipt operation to process.

To create a `PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
navigate to the `Purchase app --> Create`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to create a new request for quotation (RFQ).

From the blank `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} form, click the drop-down menu next to the
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to add a vendor. Then,
on the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line under the
`Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select the
desired product(s) to add to the quotation.

Once ready, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top
of the form, then click `Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to confirm the
`RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to a
`PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

![Completed purchase order for barcode product.](receipts_deliveries/receipts-deliveries-purchase-order.png){.align-center}

To process and scan barcodes for warehouse receipts, navigate to the
`Barcode app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Once inside the `Barcode app`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
`Barcode Scanning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} screen displaying
different options is presented. To process receipts, click on the
`Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the bottom of
the screen. This navigates to an `Operations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} overview page.

![Barcode app start screen with scanner.](receipts_deliveries/receipts-deliveries-barcode-scanner.png){.align-center}

From this page, locate the `Receipts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
card, and click the `# To Process`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button to view all outstanding receipts. Then, select the desired
receipt operation to process. This navigates to the barcode transfer
screen.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If *only* using a barcode scanner or the Odoo mobile app, the barcodes
for each transfer of a corresponding operation type can be scanned to be
processed easily. Once scanned, the products that are part of an
existing transfer can be scanned, and new products can be added to the
transfer, as well. Once all products have been scanned, validate the
transfer to proceed with the stock moves.
::::

From this screen, an overview of all receipts to process within that
transfer (**WH/IN/000XX**) is shown. At the bottom of the screen, there
are options to `Add Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, depending on if products
need to be added to the operation, or if the whole operation should be
validated at once.

![Overview of receipts in transfer to scan.](receipts_deliveries/receipts-deliveries-scanner-overview.png){.align-center}

To process and scan each product individually, choose a specific product
line. The `+#`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button (in this case,
`+10`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) can be clicked to indicate
receipt of that product, or the `pencil`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon can be clicked to open a new screen to edit that
product line.

From this screen, the product that\'s being received is listed. Under
the product name, the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line
can be edited. Either change the [0]{.title-ref} in the line to the
desired quantity, or click the `/# Units`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button (in this case, `/10 Units`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}) to automatically fill the quantity ordered from the
`PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

::: example
In the reception operation [WH/IN/00019]{.title-ref}, [10
Units]{.title-ref} of the [Barcode Product]{.title-ref} is expected to
be received. [\[BARCODE_PROD\]]{.title-ref} is the
`Internal Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set on the
product form. Scan the barcode of the [Barcode Product]{.title-ref} to
receive one unit. Afterwards, click the `pencil`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon to manually enter the received quantities.

![Product line editor for individual transfer in Barcode app.](receipts_deliveries/receipts-deliveries-product-line-editor.png){.align-center}

Additionally, the `+1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`-1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons can be clicked to add or
subtract quantity of the product, and the
`number keys`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be used to add
quantity, as well.

Below the `number keys`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is the
`location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line, which reads
[WH/Stock]{.title-ref} by default, unless another *location* is listed
on the product itself. Click this line to reveal a drop-down menu of
additional locations to choose from.

Once ready, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
confirm the changes made to the product line.

Then, from the overview page with all receipts to process within that
transfer (**WH/IN/000XX**), click the `+#`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the product line for the products being
received, and click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
receipt has now been processed, and the `Barcode app`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} can be closed out.

![Overview of receipts in transfer to validate.](receipts_deliveries/receipts-deliveries-validate-transfer.png){.align-center}

## Scan barcodes for delivery orders

To process warehouse deliveries for outgoing products, there first needs
to be a sales order (SO) created, and a delivery operation to process.

To create a `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, navigate
to the `Sales app --> Create`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} to
create a new quotation.

From the blank quotation form, click the drop-down menu next to the

# Retrieve EPC codes

Electronic product codes
(`EPC (electronic product code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}) are
globally unique identifiers assigned to specific products, allowing
items to be distinguished at the individual level. These identifiers
support accurate inventory management by enabling faster cycle counts,
streamlined adjustments, and more precise stock control.

After EPCs are
`obtained <barcode/operations/retrieve_epcs_gs1>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} from `GS1 (Global Standards 1)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, they are
`encoded <barcode/operations/write_epcs>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
onto `RFID (radio frequency identification)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} tags, which are then applied to products and used
throughout the inventory process.

::: seealso
Set up `../setup/rfid`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If using Odoo 18, `GS1 (Global Standards 1)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}\'s Encoder/Decoder tool **must** be used to retrieve EPCs.
::::

## Retrieving EPCs from GS1 {#barcode/operations/retrieve_epcs_gs1}

To retrieve an EPC to encode on a tag, use [GS1\'s EPC Encoder/Decoder
tool](https://www.gs1.org/services/epc-encoderdecoder).

1.  Enter the GTIN-14 barcode of the product in the application
    identifier `(01)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
2.  Enter the product\'s serial number in the `(21)`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field.
3.  Specify a company prefix length.
4.  Specify the size of the tag and its filter value.

![Complete the fields of the EPC Encoder/Decoder tool.](retrieve_epcs/retrieve-from-gs1.png)

## Writing EPCs to RFID tags {#barcode/operations/write_epcs}

After retrieving the EPCs, you can use an RFID writer to write the EPCs
onto RFID tags. The process to write EPCs varies by RFID writer
manufacturer. Refer to the RFID writer\'s documentation for more

# Manage inventory with RFID

Managing inventory with an RFID barcode scanner is possible with the
**Barcodes** app and a physical RFID scanner.

::: seealso
`../setup/rfid`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

Make sure the RFD40 scanner is paired and connected to the mobile
computer or smartphone. Open an operation (like a receipt, transfer,
delivery order, or manufacturing order), or count inventory using the
RFID scanner. Scanning an existing operation barcode pulls up the
relevant inventory or manufacturing documents in Odoo on the mobile
device.

## Overview of the workflow

With the RFD40 scanner in hand, open the **Barcode** app on the computer
or phone. Open the operation record (via the **Barcode** interface or
scanning the operation barcode), or open the
`Inventory count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} operation. Scan the
RFID barcodes for the product.

::: seealso
`../setup/operation_types`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

To begin managing inventory using RFID tags, open the **Barcode** app on
the smart device.

## Manage inventory {#inventory/barcode/rfid_manage}

From the **Barcode** app, scan the operation barcode or tap the
`Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to open
operations for receipts, internal transfers, delivery orders, or
manufacturing orders. If the reading device is not connected, Odoo will
automatically connect to the device. When the device is connected, a
toast notification appears on the screen that verifies the connection.
Scan the products, then validate the scan on the mobile computer or
smartphone.

![Validate the operation on the mobile device.](scan_rfid/validate-receipt.png)

## Counting inventory {#inventory/barcode/rfid_count}

It is required by many factories and warehouses to keep track of
inventory, including regular counts of products to ensure all records
are correct. To change the amount of a product in stock, or adjust
inventory, open the `Inventory count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
operation. Scan the products to count. If necessary, verify the count
manually. You can update the count by clicking the
`fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(edit)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon. Click `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to apply the count on the smart device.

corresponding drop-down menu), where either
`Default Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Default GS1 Nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be
selected. The nomenclature selected changes how scanners interpret
barcodes in Odoo.

There is also a `Configure Product Barcodes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} internal link arrow, and a set of
`Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons for printing barcode
commands and a barcode demo sheet.

![Enabled Barcode feature in Inventory app settings.](transfers_scratch/transfers-scratch-enabled-barcode-setting.png){.align-center}

## Scan barcodes for internal transfers

To create and process internal transfers for products in a warehouse,
the `Storage
Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} features **must**
be enabled.

To do so, go to the
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, scroll down to the
`Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and click the
checkboxes next to `Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the
page to save changes.

### Create an internal transfer

To process existing internal transfers, there first needs to be an
internal transfer created, and an operation to process.

To create an internal transfer, navigate to the
`Inventory app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. From the
`Inventory Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard,
locate the `Internal Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} card,
and click on the `0 To Process`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button.

Then, click `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the top left
of the resulting page. This navigates to a new
`Internal Transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form.

On this blank form, the `Operation Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is automatically listed as `Internal
Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Under that field, the
`Source Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Destination Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are set as
`WH/Stock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} by default, but can be
changed to whichever locations the products are being moved from, and
moved to.

![Blank internal transfer form with source location and destination location.](transfers_scratch/transfers-scratch-internal-transfer-form.png){.align-center}

Once the desired locations have been selected, products can be added to
the transfer. On the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line
under the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select the
desired product(s) to add to the transfer.

Once ready, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top
of the form to save the new internal transfer. Once saved, click the
`Detailed Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon (four
lines, at the far right of the `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} line) to open the
`Detailed Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

![Internal transfer detailed operations pop-up window.](transfers_scratch/transfers-scratch-detailed-operations-popup.png){.align-center}

From the pop-up, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then, in the `To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, change the
location from `WH/Stock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to a
different location, where the products should be moved.

Next, in the `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, change
the quantity to the desired quantity to transfer. Once ready, click
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to close out the pop-up
window.

### Scan barcodes for internal transfer

To process and scan barcodes for internal transfers, navigate to the
`Barcode app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Once inside the `Barcode app`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
`Barcode Scanning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} screen displaying
different options is presented.

To process internal transfers, click on the
`Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the bottom of
the screen. This navigates to an `Operations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} overview page.

![Barcode app start screen with scanner.](transfers_scratch/transfers-scratch-barcode-app.png){.align-center}

From this page, locate the `Internal Transfers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} card, and click the `# To
Process`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to view all
outstanding internal transfers. Then, select the desired operation to
process. This navigates to the barcode transfer screen.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When using the *Barcode* app without the *Inventory* app (**only** if
using a barcode scanner or the Odoo mobile app), the barcodes for each
transfer of a corresponding operation type can be scanned to be
processed easily.

Once scanned, the products that are part of an existing transfer can be
scanned, and new products can be added to the transfer, as well. Once
all products have been scanned, validate the transfer to proceed with
the stock moves.
::::

From this screen, an overview of all products to process within that
specific internal transfer (**WH/INT/000XX**) is shown. At the bottom of
the screen, there are options to `Add
Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, depending on if products
need to be added to the operation, or if the whole operation should be
validated at once.

![Overview of receipts in transfer to scan.](transfers_scratch/transfers-scratch-receipts-overview.png){.align-center}

Then, scan the barcode of the product to process the internal transfer.

Or, to process and scan each product individually, choose a specific
product line. The `+ 1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button can be
clicked to add additional quantity of that product to the transfer, or
the `pencil icon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be clicked to
open a new screen to edit that product line.

In the product\'s pop-up window, the product and the units to process is
displayed with a number pad. Under the product name, the
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line can be edited. Change
the number in the line to the quantity listed to be transferred on the
internal transfer form.

::: example
In the internal transfer operation [WH/INT/000XX]{.title-ref}, [50
Units]{.title-ref} of the [Transfer Product]{.title-ref} is moved from
[WH/Stock]{.title-ref} to [WH/Stock/Shelf 1]{.title-ref}.
[\[TRANSFER_PROD\]]{.title-ref} is the `Internal
Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set on the product form.
Scan the barcode of the [Transfer Product]{.title-ref} to receive one
unit. Afterwards, click the `pencil icon`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to manually enter the transferred quantities.

![Product line editor for individual transfer in Barcode app.](transfers_scratch/transfers-scratch-product-line-editor.png){.align-center}
:::

Additionally, the `+1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`-1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons can be clicked to add or
subtract quantity of the product, and the number keys can be used to add
quantity, as well.

Below the number keys are the two `location`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} lines, which read whichever locations were previously
specified on the internal transfer form, in this case
[WH/Stock]{.title-ref} and [WH/Stock/Shelf 1]{.title-ref}. Click these
lines to reveal a drop-down menu of additional locations to choose from.

Once ready, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
confirm the changes made to the product line.

Then, from the overview page with all products to process within that
transfer (**WH/INT/000XX**), click `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The receipt has now been processed, and the *Barcode*
app can be closed out.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The *Barcode* app can also be used to scan products in internal
transfers containing unique lot numbers and serial numbers.

From the barcode transfer screen, scan the barcode of a lot or serial
number, and Odoo automatically increases the quantity of the product to
the quantity recorded in the database. If the same lot or serial number
is shared between different products, scan the product barcode first,
then the barcode of the lot/serial number.
::::

::: seealso
`Connect to the Barcode Lookup database <barcode/setup/barcodelookup>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to quickly create new products by scanning their barcodes
during internal transfers.
:::

## Create a transfer from scratch

In addition to processing and scanning barcodes for existing,
previously-created internal transfers, the *Barcode* app can also be
used to create transfers from scratch, simply by scanning a printed
operation type barcode.

::: admonition
Did you know?

Odoo\'s *Barcode* application provides demo data with barcodes to
explore the features of the app. These can be used for testing purposes,
and can be printed from the home screen of the app. To access this demo
data, navigate to the `Barcode app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click `stock
barcodes sheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (bolded and
highlighted in blue) in the information pop-up above the scanner.

![Demo data prompt pop-up on Barcode app main screen.](transfers_scratch/transfers-scratch-demo-data.png){.align-center}
:::

To do this, first navigate to the `Barcode app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Once inside the *Barcode* app, a
`Barcode Scanning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} screen displaying
different options is presented.

From this screen, when using a USB or bluetooth barcode scanner,
directly scan the product barcode.

When using a smartphone as the barcode scanner, click the
`Tap to Scan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button (next to the
camera icon, at the center of the screen). This opens a
`Barcode Scanner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up screen that
enables the camera of the device being used.

Face the camera toward the printed operation type barcode to scan it.
Doing so processes the barcode, and navigates to a barcode transfer
screen.

From this screen, an overview of all products to process within that
specific internal transfer (**WH/INT/000XX**) is shown. Since this is a
new transfer created from scratch, however, there should not be any
products listed on the page.

To add products, scan the product barcode. If the barcode is not
available, manually enter the product into the system by clicking the
`Add Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the bottom of
the screen, and add the products and product quantities that should be
transferred.

Once ready, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
confirm the changes made to the product line.

![Blank product editor in scratch internal transfer.](transfers_scratch/transfers-scratch-blank-product-editor.png){.align-center}

Then, from the overview page with all products to process within that
transfer (**WH/INT/000XX**), click `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The internal transfer has now been processed, and the
*Barcode* app can be closed out.

# Barcode Lookup

[Barcode Lookup](https://www.barcodelookup.com/) allows you to scan (or
enter) products\' barcodes
(`UPC (Universal Product Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
`EAN (European Article Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, or `ISBN
(International Standard Book Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}) to
automatically create them in your Odoo database, complete with product
names, descriptions, images, categories, etc.

## Configuration {#barcodelookup/configuration}

If your database is hosted on **Odoo Online**, you can use Barcode
Lookup without configuration.

If your database is hosted on **Odoo.sh** or **on-premise**, proceed as
follows:

1.  Visit the [Barcode Lookup
    website](https://www.barcodelookup.com/api) and click
    `Sign Up for the API`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
2.  Choose the appropriate plan based on the number of barcodes you need
    to scan.
3.  Fill in the required details and complete the registration process.
4.  Copy the API key.
5.  In Odoo, open the Settings app, scroll down to the
    `Integrations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and,
    under `Barcode Database`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, paste
    the Barcode Lookup `API Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Use

To fill in product information using Barcode Lookup, create a new
product and fill in the `Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. The product\'s details are then automatically imported from
Barcode Lookup, updating the following fields: `Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Image`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Attributes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Product
category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Volume`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. You can then modify any
field(s) as needed.

# Barcode device troubleshooting

Odoo *Barcode* supports three main types of barcode scanners: USB
scanners, bluetooth scanners, and mobile computer scanners. While
configuring each type of scanner, common issues may arise, in which the
scanners do not work as intended, and Odoo returns errors to the device.

Read the sections below to identify general and unique device issues,
related to specific, popular types of scanners.

## General issues

Refer to the following sections below for common issues involving
popular barcode scanner devices.

For issues related to specific devices, refer to the `Android scanners
<barcode/setup/android-scanners>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} section
for mobile computer scanners, or to the `Screenless
scanners <barcode/setup/screenless-scanners>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} section for USB and bluetooth scanners.

### Barcode cannot be read

One common issue encountered when using barcode scanners is an error
resulting from barcodes that cannot be read.

This can occur due to any of the following reasons:

- The barcode is damaged.
- The device cannot read the required barcode type (some scanners can
  only read 2D barcodes).
- The barcode being scanned is on a screen. Some scanners don\'t support
  this, and the barcodes **must** be printed out to be scanned. This is
  most common with 1D barcodes.
- The device has no battery, or is broken. To rule this out, follow the
  troubleshooting instructions in the following sections.

### Odoo returns barcode error

All types of barcode scanners have their own device \"language\", which
affects how they output barcode data to Odoo\'s *Barcode* app.
Sometimes, this can cause Odoo *Barcode* to return a barcode error after
scanning. This could be due to any of the following reasons:

- The computer is configured with a different keyboard layout than the
  barcode scanner. To rule this out, ensure that the device is
  configured with the same keyboard layout.

  For example, if the computer is configured to use an FR-BE keyboard,
  configure the scanner to send FR-BE keystrokes. The same logic applies
  if using a tablet instead of a computer.

  For more information on configuring keystrokes, refer to the
  `Barcode scanner setup
  <hardware>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} documentation.

- For mobile computer scanners (such as Zebra devices, for example), the
  scanner might interpret the barcode differently than intended. To rule
  this out, scan a test barcode to see how the scanner interprets the
  barcode.

## Android scanners {#barcode/setup/android-scanners}

The most recent barcode scanner models using Android and Google Chrome
should work with Odoo. However, due to the variety of models and
configurations, it is recommended to first test a scanner\'s
compatibility with Odoo.

The Zebra product line is recommended; specifically, the **Zebra TC21
(WiFi-only)**, and **Zebra TC26 (WiFi/cellular)**.

::: seealso
[Odoo Inventory & Barcode compatible
hardware](https://www.odoo.com/app/inventory-hardware)
:::

### Barcode app does not give feedback

By default, Android barcode scanners pre-process the barcode, then send
a full text. Since Odoo *Barcode* does not read this type of output,
settings for each type of scanner **must** be configured correctly.

Odoo *Barcode* expects that the scanner works like an analogue keyboard,
and so, only detects *key events*. Refer to the following sections for
configuration settings for the most popular devices.

### Zebra TC21/TC26

When using Zebra scanners, ensure the following keystroke configurations
are set to prevent errors.

Begin on the Zebra scanner\'s home screen, and select the
`DataWedge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app (the app is
represented by a `(light blue barcode)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon).

On the `DataWedge Profiles`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page,
select the profile option to access the Zebra scanner\'s settings.

Once the profile is selected, scroll down to the
`Keyboard Output`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, and ensure
the `Enable/disable keystroke output`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option is `Enabled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Show keystroke option in the Zebra scanner\'s DataWedge app.](device_troubleshooting/device-troubleshooting-zebra-settings.png){.align-center}

Once that option is enabled, go back to the `Profile`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} options page, and go to the
`Keystroke output`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Then,
open the `Key event options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} submenu.
Under `Characters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, ensure the
`Send Characters as Events`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is
checked.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Send Characters as Events`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option **must** be checked on the Zebra scanner, or Odoo **cannot**
recognize the barcodes that are scanned.
::::

Once the above steps have been taken, perform a test scan to ensure the
Zebra scanner is working as intended.

### MUNBYN Android devices

When using MUNBYN Android scanners, ensure the following configurations
are set to prevent errors.

From the device\'s home screen, click `AppSettings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. On the resulting page, locate the
`Process mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and select
`Keyboard input`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Process mode section on MUNBYN scanner\'s AppSettings page.](device_troubleshooting/device-troubleshooting-munbyn-process-mode.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The selected *Process mode* controls how data is processed after barcode
data has been read out.

*Keyboard input* enters read-out data at the position of the cursor, the
same as input data on an analogue keyboard would.
::::

Once the above steps have been taken, perform a test scan to ensure the
MUNBYN Android scanner is working as intended.

::: admonition
Why is there no data output in the app after a successful scan?

When scanning a barcode, the scanner might beep, indicating a successful
scan, but there is no data output in the app.

To fix this issue, adjust the output method to *keyboard analogue* in
the *Scanner* app on the device.

From the device\'s home screen, click
`Scanner App --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. From
the `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, click
`Output Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The resulting pop-up
window presents the different output options available to users. Select
`Keyboard Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then click
`OK`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Output mode pop-up window on MUNBYN scanner.](device_troubleshooting/device-troubleshooting-output-mode-popup.png){.align-center}

Go back to the app that needs to be scanned, and click on the input
dialog box first before scanning. Finally, perform a test scan to ensure
the MUNBYN Android scanner is working as intended.
:::

### Datalogic Android devices

When using Datalogic Android scanners, ensure the following
configurations are set to prevent errors.

To view and configure all settings for the scanner, use the *Settings*
app on the Datalogic Android device. From the applications menu, select
`Settings --> System --> Scanner
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

From the resulting list of settings, select `Wedge`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. From this menu, under the
`Keyboard wedge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, ensure that
the `Enable keyboard wedge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature
is activated.

Then, also under the `Keyboard wedge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section, locate the `Keyboard wedge input
mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. By default, the input
mode is set to `Text injection`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Wedge configuration menu on Datalogic scanner.](device_troubleshooting/device-troubleshooting-wedge-menu.png){.align-center}

Click `Keyboard wedge input mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and change the setting to `Key pressure`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. This ensures that scanned barcodes are translated into
keyboard strokes, instead of being injected into the text area.

![Keyboard wedge input mode selection on Datalogic scanner.](device_troubleshooting/device-troubleshooting-keyboard-wedge-input.png){.align-center}

Once all those steps have been taken, perform a test scan to ensure the
Datalogic Android scanner is working as intended.

## Screenless scanners {#barcode/setup/screenless-scanners}

Screenless scanners are barcode scanning devices that have no screens.
These include USB scanners and bluetooth scanners.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo supports most USB and Bluetooth barcode scanners, as they all
emulate a keyboard. However, to verify that a scanner is compatible with
a specific keyboard layout (or can be configured to do so), refer to
Odoo\'s [Inventory & Barcode compatible
hardware](https://www.odoo.com/app/inventory-hardware) documentation.
::::

### NETUM devices

By default, the NETUM barcode scanner\'s user manual only shows the
French keyboard configuration. To use the Belgian keyboard, scan the
code below:

![Belgian FR key barcode.](device_troubleshooting/device-troubleshooting-belgium-fr-key.png){.align-center}

Once that code has been scanned, ensure the NETUM scanner has the
correct keyboard configuration, and is working as intended.

# Barcode scanner setup

::: {#barcode/setup/hardware}
Follow this guide to choose and set up a barcode scanner compatible with
Odoo\'s *Inventory* and *Barcode* apps.
:::

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="hardware/barcode-scanner.png"
alt="An image of an example barcode scanner." />
</figure>

## Scanner types

Before setting up a barcode scanner, it is important to determine which
type of scanner best meets the needs of the business. There are three
main types of scanners that can be used with Odoo, each with their own
benefits and use cases:

- **USB scanners** are connected to a computer, and are suitable for
  businesses that scan products at a fixed location, like at the
  checkout line in a grocery store.

- **Bluetooth scanners** pair with a smartphone or tablet, making them
  both a cost-effective and portable barcode scanner option. In this
  scenario, Odoo is installed on the smartphone, allowing warehouse
  operators to handle operations, and check stock, directly through
  their mobile devices.

- **Mobile computer scanners** are mobile devices with a built-in
  barcode scanner.

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  If using a USB scanner, ensure the scanner is compatible with the
  keyboard layout of the computer.

  If using a mobile computer scanner, ensure the device can run the Odoo
  mobile app properly. Recent models that use Android OS with the Google
  Chrome browser, or Windows OS with Microsoft Edge, should work.
  However, testing is crucial due to the variety of available models and
  configurations.
  ::::

::: seealso
[Odoo Inventory & Barcode • Compatible
Hardware](https://www.odoo.com/app/inventory-hardware)
:::

## Configuration

When setting up the barcode scanner, make sure the following
configurations are correct so the scanner can properly interpret
barcodes with Odoo.

### Keyboard layout

When using a USB barcode scanner, match its keyboard layout with the
operating system\'s layout for proper interpretation of characters.
Generally, the scanning mode should be set to accept a USB keyboard
(HID), with the language set based on the keyboard that is in use.

To configure the keyboard layout for a **Zebra** scanner, scan the
keyboard wedge barcode for the desired language in the scanner\'s user
manual.

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="hardware/keyboard-barcode.png"
alt="Example of a user manual for keyboard layout." />
<figcaption>Examples of keyboard language settings in the Zebra scanner
user manual.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Automatic carriage return

Odoo has a default 100-millisecond delay between scans to prevent
accidental double scanning. To synchronize with the barcode scanner, set
it to include a *carriage return* (`character like
the "Enter" key on a keyboard`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}) after each
scan. Odoo interprets the carriage return as the end of the barcode
input; so Odoo accepts the scan, and waits for the next one.

Typically, on the scanner, a carriage return is included by default.
Ensure it is set by scanning a specific barcode in the user manual, like
[CR suffix ON]{.title-ref} or [Apply Enter for suffix]{.title-ref}.

## Zebra scanner

When using Zebra scanners, ensure the following keystroke configurations
are set to prevent errors.

Begin on the Zebra scanner\'s home screen, and select the
`DataWedge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app (the app is
represented by a `(light blue barcode)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon).

On the `DataWedge Profiles`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page,
select the profile option to access the Zebra scanner\'s settings.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

It is **not** suggested to use the \"DWDemo\" profile, as it does not
work properly in every circumstance.

Instead, it is recommended to create a new, personal profile. Once a new
profile is created, add the *Odoo Mobile* app and *Google Chrome* app in
the `Associated Apps`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
scanner\'s home screen.
::::

Once the profile is selected, scroll down to the
`Keyboard Output`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, and ensure
the `Enable/disable keystroke output`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option is `Enabled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Show keystroke option in the Zebra scanner\'s DataWedge app.](hardware/enable-keystroke.png){.align-center}

Once that option is enabled, go back to the `Profile`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} options page, and go to the
`Keystroke output`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Then,
open the `Key event options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} submenu.
Under `Characters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, ensure the
`Send Characters as Events`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is
checked.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Send Characters as Events`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option **must** be checked on the Zebra scanner, or Odoo **cannot**
recognize the barcodes that are scanned.
::::

Once all those steps have been taken, perform a test scan to ensure the
Zebra scanner is working properly, as intended.

## Honeywell mobile computer scanner

When using Honeywell scanners, follow the instructions below to ensure
barcodes can be scanned in Odoo.

Begin on the Honeywell scanner\'s home screen, and select
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, represented by a
`⚙️ (gear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon. Then, click
`Honeywell Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, followed by
`Scanning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

From here, click `Internal Scanner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
followed by `Default Profile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. From
the resulting list of options, select
`Data Processing Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The `Data Processing Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
specify how barcode data is processed by the computer. Locate the
`Wedge Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting. By default,
this is set to `Standard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Data processing settings options for Honeywell scanner.](hardware/hardware-honeywell-settings.png){.align-center}

Change the `Wedge Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting to
`Keyboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

After completing the steps, conduct a test scan to verify the Honeywell
scanner is working as intended.

## Cipherlab mobile computer scanner

When using Cipherlab scanners, follow the instructions below to ensure
barcodes can be scanned in Odoo.

Begin on the Cipherlab scanner\'s home screen, and navigate to the
`App Drawer (All
Applications)`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Then, click the
`ReaderConfig`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app, represented by an
orange `⚙️ (gear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon over a blue
`(barcode)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon.

Next, select the `Default Profile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
or create a new profile, if needed.

Under the `General Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click
`Data Output`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, followed by
`Keyboard Emulation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Cipherlab scanner data output setting page.](hardware/hardware-cipherlab-settings.png){.align-center}

By default, the `Input Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, under
`Keyboard Emulation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, is set to
`Default Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Change this setting
to `KeyEvent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Operation types and commands

Inventory operations, like `receipts and delivery orders
<../../inventory/shipping_receiving/daily_operations/receipts_delivery_one_step>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, as well as commands, like validating a transfer or putting
products in packages, can be performed by scanning barcodes through the
**Barcode** app. This allows employees to handle tasks and access menus
without the need to touch a screen or use the **Inventory** app on a
computer, and allows workflow streamlining by putting operation barcodes
in the appropriate physical location.

![Printable barcodes for Receipts, Delivery Orders, and Manufacturing.](operation_types/barcode-default-operations.png)

## Configuring operations {#inventory/barcode/configure_operations}

*Operation types* in the **Inventory** and **Barcode** apps define
actions that will change the state of products in inventory. Which
operation types are available to print will depend on the settings of
the database. By default, barcodes can be printed for *Receipts (WHIN)*,
*Delivery Orders (WHOUT)*, and *Manufacturing (WHMANUF)*. The *Internal
Transfers (WHINT)* and *Pick (WHPICK)* operations can also be enabled.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Both *Internal Transfers (WHINT)* and *Pick (WHPICK)* operations require
`location barcodes
<software>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to scan.
::::

### Internal transfers

The *Internal Transfers (WHINT)* operation barcode is available if the
database is using the *Storage Locations* feature to designate where
products are located in the inventory. To enable this setting, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then, in the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, tick the `Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option.

### Picking

The *Pick (WHPICK)* operation barcode is available if the database is
using the *Multi-Step Routes* feature configured with a picking step. To
enable this setting, go to `Inventory app
--> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
then, in the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
tick the `Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option
and save. From there, click `fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Set Warehouse Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to open warehouse settings and select the warehouse. In the
`Outgoing Shipments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, select
either `Pick then Deliver (2 steps)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
or `Pick, Pack, then Deliver (3 steps)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

role="doc"} - `Three-step delivery
<../../inventory/shipping_receiving/daily_operations/delivery_three_steps>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Print barcodes for inventory commands and operations

Barcodes for operations and commands can be printed at any time. These
documents will include all the available inventory commands, regardless
of whether they are enabled, but only the operations that are currently
enabled in the database. See `configuring operations
<inventory/barcode/configure_operations>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
to enable any missing operations.

::: example
The [print_inventory_commands_and_operation_types]{.title-ref} document
will always show the `PUT IN PACK`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
command, regardless of whether the *Packages* feature is enabled, but
the *Pick (WHPICK)* operation will only be added if *Multi-Step Routes*
are configured to have a picking step.
:::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Printing barcodes, by default, will either directly download a PDF file
of the selected barcodes or open a new tab with a downloadable or
printable PDF. To turn this into a direct printing operation,
`connect a printer <../../../general/iot/devices/printer>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
::::

### When first opening Barcode

When first opening the **Barcode** app, there is a prompt with options
to print barcodes for commands and operations, as well as some sample
barcodes to print and use for testing. Clicking these links is the
easiest way to print command and operation barcodes, but will no longer
be displayed after the first time it is clicked.

![A prompt to print demo data or barcodes for operations.](operation_types/barcode-initial-print-prompt.png)

### From Inventory settings

If the barcode print prompt is not available, inventory commands and
operation types barcodes can always be printed from the *Settings* page.
Go to `Inventory app --> Configuration
--> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and in the
`Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section under the
`Barcode Scanner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting, click
`fa-print`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Print barcode commands and operation types`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Link to print inventory operations and commands.](operation_types/print-operations-and-commands.png)

### Individual operations

Barcodes for individual operations, like receipts and manufacturing
orders, can also be printed from the *Operations Types* configuration
menu. To select operations to print, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Operations Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and tick the box by each operation type required.

![Available operations selected making a \'Print\' button appear.](operation_types/barcode-print-operations.png)

Next, click the `fa-print`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and select either
`Operation
type (PDF)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to download a PDF with
the operation barcodes, or `Operation type (ZPL)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to send the print job to a
`ZPL-enabled printer <iot/link-printer>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `fa-print`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Print`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button does not appear until at least one operation
type is selected.
::::

## Print picking operations for specific orders {#inventory/barcode/print_order}

Receipts, manufacturing orders, transfers, and delivery orders can all
be printed in advance and are referred to in the print options menu as
*picking operations* or *picking*.

### In Barcode

From the **Barcode** app, tap the `Operations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, select the operation type, and then the
specific order to print. From there, either scan the [PRINT PICKING
OPERATION]{.title-ref} barcode if there is one available, or tap the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(gear)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon to open the **Barcode** actions menu and tap the
`Print Picking Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![Menu from a receipt with the \'Print Picking Operation\' button.](operation_types/print-picking-barcode-cog.png)

### In Inventory

To print a picking from the **Inventory** app, click the appropriate
operation type (*Receipt*, *Delivery Order*, etc.) and select the
individual order or the operation.

From the order, click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Actions)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, hover over
`fa-print`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Print`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and click `Picking Operations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The type of operation can be inferred from the operation reference to
help distinguish picking operations. For example, the \"IN\" in
[WH/IN/00012]{.title-ref} indicates that it is a receipt operation.
These references are similar to, but do not exactly match the operation
type barcodes.
::::

## Use barcodes for inventory operations and commands

### Operations

- **Receipts** [WHIN]{.title-ref} creates a new order to receive
  products into inventory.

  > :::: warning
  > ::: title
  > Warning
  > :::
  >
  > Scanning a barcode for a receipt will always create a *new* instance

  > `print a picking for the individual receipt <inventory/barcode/print_order>`{.interpreted-text
  > role="ref"}.
  >
  > For example, scanning **Receipts** [WHIN]{.title-ref} will create a
  > brand new receipt, even if the contents match an existing receipt
  > exactly.
  > ::::

- **Delivery Orders** [WHOUT]{.title-ref} opens the currently scheduled
  delivery orders.

- **Manufacturing** [WHMANUF]{.title-ref} creates a new manufacturing
  order. Scanning a product barcode from here will add it to the
  *Producing* list.

- **Internal Transfers** [WHINT]{.title-ref} creates a new transfer
  order. `Location barcodes <software>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
  can be scanned to designate the source and destination, or scanned
  direction to initiate a transfer in **Barcode**.

- **Pick** [WHPICK]{.title-ref} creates a new picking operation. This
  will *require* a `location barcode
  <software>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} for the source location.

### Commands

- \`MAIN MENU\`: Scan to return to the main menu from an inventory
  adjustment.
- \`VALIDATE\`: Scan to confirm that an operation is correct and ready
  to be completed.
- \`CANCEL\`: Scan from an operation to prevent that operation from
  being validated and set its status to *Cancelled*.
- \`PRINT PICKING OPERATION\`: Scan from an existing delivery order,
  transfer, or receipt to generate a PDF with the name and barcode for
  that operation\'s reference number. This can be scanned later to go
  directly to the operation.
- \`PRINT DELIVERY SLIP\`: Scan from an existing receipt or delivery
  order to generate a PDF of the purchase order or delivery order. This
  will not include a barcode.
- \`PUT IN PACK\`: After scanning products, this command will designate
  them as all being in one
  `package <../../inventory/product_management/configure/package>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}. Products scanned *after* this command are placed in a new
  package if the [PUT IN PACK]{.title-ref} command is scanned again.
- \`SCRAP\`: Scan this to mark a scanned product as defective, and move
  it to a virtual location for
  `scrap inventory <../../inventory/warehouses_storage/inventory_management/scrap_inventory>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}

## Print barcodes for manufacturing commands

By default, the `Manufacturing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
operation type can scan products and components and tap a *Produce*
button to produce them. To print barcodes for basic manufacturing
operations, go to
`Manufacturing app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then, in the `Operations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, make sure the
`Barcode Scanner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box is ticked and
click `fa-print`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Print barcode commands and operation types`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

### Work order commands

To enable more granular control of the manufacturing process through
**Barcode**, enable the
`Work Orders <../../manufacturing/basic_setup/bill_configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} feature. To print barcodes for work orders, go to
`Manufacturing app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then, in the `Operations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, make sure the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} box is ticked and click `fa-print`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Print barcode commands`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

# RFID

RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identification. RFID enables the
tracking of items using radio waves: RFID tags are attached to products
in inventory, and RFID readers can read those tags to transmit
information to a computer. RFID helps automate processes by keeping
inventory accurate and tracking internal and external moves.

RFID tags transmit electronic product codes
(`EPC (electronic product code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}), which
are unique identifiers to distinguish individual items. The
`EPC (electronic product code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in Odoo
is based on GS1 standards to consistently identify products worldwide.
GS1 nomenclature establishes common rules for encoding information
within a barcode to facilitate the global exchange of goods.

::: seealso
`../operations/gs1_nomenclature`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Hardware

The following are required to begin working with RFID in Odoo:

- Zebra TCX Series mobile computer, or
- Android Smartphone

Paired with:

- Zebra RFD40 (can read and write RFID tags)

## Configuration

Before using RFID tags to manage inventory, the Android Package Kit
(APK) with RFID support must be installed on the mobile computer or
smartphone.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Before installing the APK on an individual device, first enable the
ability to install unknown apps in the device settings. Find this
setting in the device\'s `App`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`App
& Notification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} settings, under the
`Special access`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Special app access`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.
::::

Then, download the APK. On the `Downloads`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, under the `Mobile Application`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, click `Download`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} next to the `Android`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option, then select
`Download APK (with Zebra RFID support)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu. Download this file via a
computer and transfer the APK via USB or Bluetooth, or use the device\'s
web browser to download the APK.

![Download the APK from the Download page.](rfid/download-apk.png)

Install the APK. If `Install unknown apps`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is enabled for the device\'s web browser, install the
APK directly from the browser download notification. If
`Install unknown apps`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is enabled for
the device\'s file manager, open it and navigate to the location where
the file is stored, then tap it to install the APK.

Then, when reading or writing RFID tags, ensure that the Zebra device
and the smart device are paired and connected.

## Set a compatible barcode

Before you can manage inventory using RFID tags, a compatible barcode
must be assigned to the products. Set the product barcode in the product
form.

::: seealso
`Set product barcodes <inventory/barcode/set-barcodes>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
:::

To work with RFID, the product barcode must be GTIN-14-compatible, and
inventory tracking must be enabled for the product. Product barcodes
that are not GTIN-14-compatible must be upgraded to work with RFID.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Tracking by serial number or lots does not need to be enabled for this
feature to work properly.
::::

## Limitations

- The serial number that is part of the
  `EPC (electronic product code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} must
  only be numeric, as SGTIN-96 is the only supported encoding scheme for
  RFID tags in Odoo. Alphanumeric serial numbers are **not** supported.
- For products tracked by lot, the lot can be scanned in, but it will be
  considered as one lot with a quantity of [1]{.title-ref}. It does not
  count individual products in a receipt.
- Only ultra-high frequency (UHF) RFID tags are supported.
- Products need to be GS1-registered because barcodes must be unique.

# Barcodes for lot and serial numbers

The **Barcode** app saves time and prevents user errors while handling
`lot
<../../inventory/product_management/product_tracking/lots>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and `serial numbers
<../../inventory/product_management/product_tracking/serial_numbers>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. Instead of typing long sequences of characters, print and
scan barcodes instead.

## Configuration

To use lot or serial numbers:

1.  They must be enabled in the database.
2.  Tracking by lot or serial number must be selected for each product.

See the `serial numbers documentation
<../../inventory/product_management/product_tracking/serial_numbers>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and `lots documentation
<../../inventory/product_management/product_tracking/lots>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to learn how to start using this feature.

### GS1-compatible QR codes

`GS1 <../operations/gs1_nomenclature>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
nomenclature can be used for serial numbers and lots.

To enable GS1 barcodes for lots and serial numbers, go to
`Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
in the `Traceability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section under
`Lots &
Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, tick the box for
`Print GS1 Barcodes for Lots & Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Inventory settings with \'Print GS1 Barcodes for Lots & Serial Numbers\' ticked.](serial_numbers_lots/enable-gs1-barcodes.png)

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

GS1 lot and serial number barcodes require a 2D-capable scanner to be
scanned. See `hardware
configuration <hardware>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to ensure that
the feature is compatible with available equipment.
::::

### Mandatory and optional scanning {#inventory/barcode/mandatory-scan}

Operation types, like receipts and delivery orders,
`can be configured individually
<inventory/product_management/operation-type-setting>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to determine whether they require a serial or lot number to
process the operation. Additionally, the *Barcode* tab of each operation
type configures whether scanning the lot or serial number is mandatory.
*Mandatory scan* specifies that the only way to input a required serial
number or lot number is by scanning a barcode, while *optional scan*
allows users to manually type in a barcode if necessary.

To make it mandatory to scan a barcode for serial numbers and lots, go
to `Inventory
app --> Configuration --> Operations Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the operation type where barcodes
should be required for serial numbers. Then, click the
`Barcode App`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and in the
`MANDATORY SCAN`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section set
`Lot/Serial`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Mandatory Scan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Selecting \'Optional Scan\' in the Receipts operation type.](serial_numbers_lots/optional-scan.png)

## Barcodes for products and lots

To print a barcode for one or multiple product lot and serial numbers,
go to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Lots / Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. In the list view, tick the checkbox for each the
product to print, click the `fa-print`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and select either PDF
or ZPL depending on printer setup.

![Three selected products and a Print button showing \'Lot/Serial Number (PDF)\' highlighted.](serial_numbers_lots/select-products-to-print.png)

## Operations

For any product that is tracked by lot or serial number, performing an
operation with barcode can be from the main **Barcode** page by tapping
`Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and tapping the desired
operation in the interface or scanning the barcode for specific picking
order. Once the order is scanned, select the product by tapping or
scanning a barcode and scan the lot or serial number for each quantity.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Because vendor lot and serial number barcodes could be damaged in
transit and arrive in a state that cannot be scanned, it is a good
practice to `set serial number or lot scanning to
optional <inventory/barcode/mandatory-scan>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Otherwise, a broken barcode would block validation of the
receipt.
::::

For products that are starting out without a serial number, there are
three options to manage them: manually typing in the number, generating
them ahead of time, or disabling serial numbers for that operation.

### Manually input serial and lot numbers

For instances where there are few products or rare shipments, it may be
easiest to type lot or serial numbers in at the time of receipt. After
opening an existing receipt or creating a new one and scanning the
product bar code, tap the `fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(pencil)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon. Tap the
`Serial/Lot Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field and enter
the serial number and tap `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Typing in a serial number.](serial_numbers_lots/manual-sn-input.png)

### Generate serial numbers before a receipt

Lot and serial numbers can be generated from a scheduled receipt before
the products arrive. This has the advantage of making it possible to
print all the serial numbers with the picking order for the receipt.

To generate lot and serial numbers, in the **Inventory** app click
`Receipts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select the receipt
that requires generated lot or serial numbers. In the
`Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, find the line for
the product, and click the `fa-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(list)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon. In the
`Open: Stock move`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up menu, click
`Generate Serials/Lots`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Generate serial numbers for an incoming shipment.](serial_numbers_lots/serial-number-generate.png)

::: seealso
`Assign serial numbers <inventory/product_management/assign-sn>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
:::

### Disable lot and serial numbers for a receipt

With lot and serial numbers disabled for an operation, products that are
tracked by these methods can be received without supplying a serial
number or lot number. It is still possible to scan a serial number at
the receipt stage, but the missing numbers will need to be
`created in the
Inventory app <inventory/product_management/already-in-stock>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

To disable the use of serial numbers for a particular operation type, go
to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Operations Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the operation type. In the
`LOTS/SERIAL NUMBERS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, untick
`Create New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `Use
Existing ones`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The *Create New* option will require the user to supply a serial number
or lot number, either by scanning or type (if
`optional scan <inventory/barcode/mandatory-scan>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} is enabled), and will not
`automatically generate serial numbers
<inventory/product_management/generate-serials>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} the way the **Inventory** app can.

# Product and location barcodes

Inventory operations like product configuration can be streamlined by
taking advantage of barcode scanning features. Assigning barcodes to
products and locations is a key step in using the **Barcode** app, and
users can conveniently populate fields with a barcode scanner. This
reduces manual entry, minimizes errors, and speeds up common tasks like
product selection, location assignment, and inventory adjustments.

## Configuration

### Barcode nomenclature

Most retail products use EAN-13 barcodes, also known as Global Trade
Identification Numbers (GTIN). To create a new
`GTIN (Global Trade Item Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for a
product, a company must have a GS1 Company Prefix. See `GS1
nomenclature <../operations/gs1_nomenclature>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for more information about using this system.

Odoo supports using any string as a barcode, so users can also create
custom internal references to use with barcode scanners. See
`Default nomenclature <../operations/barcode_nomenclature>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to learn about optional conventions around barcodes and
default values in Odoo

To change the barcode nomenclature, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and scroll down to the
`Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section to select the
nomenclature under `Barcode Scanner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Changing barcode nomenclature in Inventory app settings.](software/barcodes-setup-change-nomenclature.png)

### Barcode lookup {#barcode/setup/barcodelookup}

Odoo can automatically add product information using the
`Stock Barcode Database`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting for
any `UPC (Universal Product Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
`EAN (European Article Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, or `ISBN
(International Standard Book Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
barcode.

To enable automatic barcode look up, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and scroll down to the
`Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section to tick the box for
`Stock
Barcode Database`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
`Barcode Lookup <barcodelookup>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Set product barcodes {#inventory/barcode/set-barcodes}

Barcodes can be assigned to existing products from the *Product
Barcodes* configuration page or from any product form in the
**Inventory**, **Manufacturing** or **Purchase** apps. The barcode field
can be populated either by typing or using scanner input.

When adding a new product, the
`barcode lookup feature <barcode/setup/barcodelookup>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} can be used to automatically find information about a
product based on its barcode, and new products can be added to the
database directly from the **Barcode** app by scanning a barcode.

### From Barcode app

New products definitions can be added to the database product lists as
well as having their on-hand inventory tracked from the **Barcode** app,
if the `Barcode Lookup feature
<barcode/setup/barcodelookup>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is enabled.
To create a new receipt for scanning new products, choose one of two
methods:

1.  From the **Barcode** front page, tap `Operations`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, tap `Receipts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    and then tap the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.
2.  Scan a printed `Receipts (WHIN)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    inventory command barcode.

![Empty new receipt form.](software/barcode-new-receipt.png)

Scanning a product that is not currently in inventory prompts a message
that the product does not exist, with a button option to
`Create New Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Pressing this
button will search the [Barcode Lookup](https://www.barcodelookup.com/)
database for a product matching the code and format, create a new
product definition in the Odoo database with the available information,
and add that product to the receipt to track the quantity on hand in
inventory.

![New product confirmation dialog.](software/barcode-scan-for-new-product.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Even if a transfer order with a product created through **Barcode** is
cancelled, the product remains available in the products list in the
**Inventory** app unless it is deleted.
::::

### From a product form

Barcodes can be added to both existing products and new products as they
are created through the products configuration form. To access a
product\'s form, go to `Inventory app -->
Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
select the product to add a barcode to.

In the `General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
click the `Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to either
type in the barcode or use a scanner to input the barcode value.

![The \'Barcode\' field on a product form with an active cursor.](software/barcode-add-to-product-form.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If using
`product variants <../../../sales/sales/products_prices/products/variants>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, configure barcodes on individual variants and not the
product template to allow scanning to retrieve the variants.
::::

### From Inventory settings

To access the *Product Barcodes* configuration page, go to
`Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. In
the `Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, under the
`Barcode
Scanner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature, click
`fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Configure Product Barcodes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. From
this list view, click the `Barcodes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column for any product to enter its barcode. Barcode scanners will
populate this field when the product is scanned.

![Selecting the Barcode field in the Product Configuration form.](software/product-barcodes-configure.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To filter for the products that do not have barcodes yet, click the
`fa-sort-desc`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Toggle Search Panel)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to add a
custom filter where the `Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
property is `is not set`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![\'Add Custom Filter\' pop-up with \'Barcode is not set\' configured.](software/barcode-filter-for-no-barcode.png)
::::

## Print location barcodes {#barcode/setup/location}

Barcodes can be assigned to locations to track of where products are
stored and manage transfers, and are automatically available if the
`Storage Locations
<../../inventory/warehouses_storage/inventory_management/use_locations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} feature is enabled.

To print barcodes for locations, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, scroll down to the
`Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section and click
`fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Tick the boxes for
locations and the `Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button will
appear, downloading a PDF with barcodes for all selected locations.

![Multiple storage locations selected with \'Print\' button at the top of the view.](software/print-storage-location-barcodes.png)

# Barcode

**Odoo Barcode** allows users to assign barcodes to individual products
and product categories, and track inventory movements using those
barcodes. By connecting a barcode scanner, certain inventory processes
can be triggered by scanning barcodes.

# Packages

A *package* is a physical container holding one or more products.
Packages can also be used to store items in bulk.

Packages are commonly used for the following purposes:

1.  `Grouping products to move them in bulk <inventory/warehouses_storage/pack>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
2.  `Shipping to customers <inventory/warehouses_storage/package-type>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}: configure package types to align with shipping
    carriers\' size and weight requirements, streamlining the packing
    process, and ensuring compliance with carrier shipping
    specifications.
3.  Storing items in bulk.

*Package use* is a field on the package form in Odoo that is only
visible by enabling the *Batch Transfers* and *Packages* features
(`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}).

By default, the *Package Use* field on a packages form is set to
*Disposable Box*. Change this field to *Reusable Box* **only** when
configuring packages for `cluster pickings
<inventory/warehouses_storage/cluster-pack>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

*Package type* is an optional feature used for
`calculating shipping cost
<../../shipping_receiving/setup_configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, based on real shipping weight. Create package types to
include the weight of the package itself (e.g. boxes, pallets, other
shipping containers) in shipping cost calculations.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

While packages are commonly used in the `three-step delivery route
<../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/delivery_three_steps>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, they can be used in any workflow involving storable
products.
::::

## Configuration {#inventory/warehouses_storage/enable-package}

To use packages, first go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Under the `Operations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} heading, activate the `Packages`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} feature. Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Activate the \*Packages\* setting in Inventory \> Configuration \> Settings.](package/enable-pack.png){.align-center}

::: {#inventory/product_management/move-entire-pack}
When moving packages internally, the *Move Entire Packages* feature can
be enabled on an operation type to update a package\'s contained item\'s
location upon updating the package\'s location.
:::

To do that, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Operations Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the desired operation this feature will
apply to (may have to set it for multiple).

On the operation type page, in the `Packages`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, tick the `Move Entire
Packages`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

## Pack items {#inventory/warehouses_storage/pack}

Products can be added to packages in any transfer by:

1.  Clicking each
    `Detailed Operations <inventory/warehouses_storage/detailed-operations>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} icon on the product line.
2.  Using the
    `Put in Pack <inventory/warehouses_storage/put-in-pack>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} button to place everything in the transfer into a
    package.

### Detailed operations {#inventory/warehouses_storage/detailed-operations}

On any warehouse transfer (e.g. receipt, delivery order), add a product
to a package by clicking the `⦙≣ (bulleted list)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon in the `Operations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.

![Show \"Detailed Operations\" icon in the product line.](package/detailed-operations.png){.align-center}

Doing so opens the `Detailed Operations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window for the `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

To put the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in a package,
click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and assign the
product to a `Destination Package`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Select an existing package, or create a new one by typing the name of
the new package, then select `Create...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

<figcaption>Twelve units of <span class="title-ref">Acoustic Bloc
Screen</span> are placed in <span
class="title-ref">PACK0000001</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>

Then, specify the quantity of items to go into the package in the
`Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. Repeat the above steps
to place the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in different
packages. Once finished, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to close the window.

items to it in the <code class="interpreted-text"
role="guilabel">Destination Package</code> field.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Package type {#inventory/warehouses_storage/package-type}

Create package types by navigating to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Package
Types`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, in order to set custom
dimensions and weight limits. This feature is mainly used to calculate
package weights for shipping costs.

:::

On the `Package Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list, clicking
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} opens a blank package type
form. The fields of the form are as follows:

- `Package Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (required): define
  the package type\'s name.
- `Size`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: define the dimensions of
  the package in millimeters (mm). The fields, from left to right,
  define the `Length`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Width`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Height`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: weight of an empty
  package (e.g. an empty box, pallet).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Odoo calculates the package\'s weight by adding the weight of the empty
package plus the weight of the item(s), which can be found in the
`Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, in the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, of each product
form.
::::

- `Max Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: maximum shipping
  weight allowed in the package.
- `Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: define a barcode to
  identify the package type from a scan.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: specify a company to
  make the package type available **only** at the selected company.
  Leave the field blank if it is available at all companies.
- `Carrier`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: specify the intended
  shipping carrier for this package type.
- `Carrier Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: define a code that
  is linked to the package type.

## Cluster packages {#inventory/warehouses_storage/cluster-pack}

To use *cluster packages*, first navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and activate the
`Batch Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature, located in
the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Doing so
makes the *Package Use* field become visible on a package form.

![Activate the \*Batch Transfers\* feature in Inventory \> Configuration \> Settings.](package/enable-batch.png){.align-center}

Add new packages by going to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Packages`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or select an existing package. Doing so opens the
package form, which contains the following fields:

- `Package Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (required):
  name of the package.

- `Package Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: used for
  `configuring shipping boxes to ship to the customer
  <inventory/warehouses_storage/package-type>`{.interpreted-text

  `Package Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is unnecessary for
  configuring packages for cluster pickings.
  ::::

- `Shipping Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: used to input
  the weight of the package after measuring it on a scale.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: specify a company to
  make the package available **only** at the selected company. Leave the
  field blank if the package is available at all companies.

- `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: current location of the
  package.

- `Pack Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date the package
  was created.

- `Package Use`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: choose
  `Reusable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for packages used for

# Packaging

In Odoo *Inventory*, *packaging* refers to disposable containers holding
multiple units of a specific product.

For example, different packages for cans of soda, such as a 6-pack, a
12-pack, or a case of 36, **must** be configured on the individual
product form. This is because packagings are product specific, not
generic.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Packaging can be used in conjunction with Odoo
`Barcode <../../../barcode/setup/software>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. When receiving products from suppliers, scanning the
packaging barcode automatically adds the number of units in the
packaging to the internal count of the product.
::::

## Configuration

To use packagings, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, under the `Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} heading, enable the
`Product Packagings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature, and
click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Enable packagings by selecting \"Product Packagings\".](packaging/enable-packagings.png){.align-center}

## Create packaging {#inventory/product_management/packaging-setup}

Packagings can be created directly on the product form, or from the
`Product Packagings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.

### From product form

Create packagings on a product form by going to
`Inventory app --> Products -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select the
desired product.

Under the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, scroll
down to the `Packaging`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and
click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In the table,
fill out the following fields:

- `Packaging`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (required): name of
  packaging that appears on sales/purchase orders as a packaging option
  for the product.
- `Contained quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (required):
  amount of product in the packaging.
- `Unit of Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (required):
  measurement unit for quantifying the product.
- `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: check this option for
  packagings intended for use on sales orders.
- `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: check this option for
  packagings intended for use on purchase orders.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Access additional fields in the `Packaging`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} table below by clicking the
`oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(additional options)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the
far-right of the column titles in the `Packaging`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, and selecting the desired options from the
drop-down menu that appears.
::::

- `Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: identifier for tracing
  packaging in stock moves or pickings, using the
  `Barcode app <barcode/operations/intro>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}. Leave blank if not in use.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: indicates the packaging
  is only available at the selected company. Leave blank to make the
  packaging available across all companies.

::: example
To create a packaging type for six units of the product, [Grape
Soda]{.title-ref}, begin by clicking `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. In the line, name the `Packaging`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} [6-pack]{.title-ref}, and set the
`Contained quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
[6]{.title-ref}. Repeat this process for additional packagings.

![Create 6-pack case for product.](packaging/create-product-packaging.png){.align-center}
:::

### From product packagings page

To view all packagings that have been created, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration
--> Product Packagings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Doing
so reveals the `Product Packagings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
page with a complete list of all packagings that have been created for
all products. Create new packagings by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

::: example
Two soda products, [Grape Soda]{.title-ref} and [Diet Coke]{.title-ref},
have three types of packagings configured. On the
`Product Packagings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, each
product can be sold as a [6-Pack]{.title-ref} that contains 6 products,
as a [12-Pack]{.title-ref} of 12 products, or as a [Case]{.title-ref} of
32 products.

![List of different packagings for products.](packaging/packagings.png){.align-center}
:::

### Partial reservation

After
`completing the packaging setup <inventory/product_management/packaging-setup>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, packagings can be reserved in full or partial quantities
for outgoing shipments. Partial packaging flexibility expedites order
fulfillment by allowing the immediate shipment of available items, while
awaiting the rest.

To configure packaging reservation methods, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration
--> Product Categories`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Then,
click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or select the desired
product category.

On the product category\'s form, in the `Logistics`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, `Reserve Packagings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} can be set to
`Reserve Only Full Packagings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Reserve Partial Packagings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To see the `Reserve Packaging`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
the `Product Packaging`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature
**must** be enabled. To enable this feature, go to `Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
scroll to the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
tick the `Product Packagings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox, and click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

![Show Reserve Packagings field on the product categories page.](packaging/reserve-packaging.png){.align-center}

::: example
To better evaluate the options based on business needs, consider the
following example:

- a product is sold in twelve units per packaging.
- an order demands two packagings.
- there are only twenty-two units in stock.

When `Reserve Only Full Packagings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
is selected, only twelve units are reserved for the order.

Conversely, when `Reserve Partial Packagings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is selected, twenty-two units are reserved for the
order.
:::

## Apply packagings

When creating a sales order in the `Sales`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} app, specify the packagings that should be used
for the product. The chosen packaging is displayed on the
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} under the
`Packaging`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

::: example
18 cans of the product, [Grape Soda]{.title-ref}, is packed using three
6-pack packagings.

![Assign packagings on the Sales Order Line.](packaging/packagings-sales-order.png){.align-center}
:::

## Routes for packaging {#inventory/product_management/packaging-route}

When receiving packagings, by default, they follow the warehouse\'s
`configured reception route
<../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. To **optionally** set up a packaging-specific route, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Routes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The *Product Packagings*, *Storage Locations*, and *Multi-Step Routes*
features (found by going to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}) **must** be activated, and saved.
::::

::: seealso
`../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/use_routes`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

### Create route

On the `Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or select a route that is
**not** for a warehouse. Next, in the `Applicable on`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, tick the `Packagings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox.

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="packaging/route.png" alt="Create route for a packaging." />
<figcaption>Route with "Packagings" selected, with "Products" and
"Warehouses" not selected.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Apply route on packaging {#inventory/product_management/route-on-packaging}

Then, to apply the route, go to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the product that uses packaging.

In the product form, switch to the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. In the `Packaging`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section that contains
`configured packagings <inventory/product_management/packaging-setup>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, click the `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(additional options)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon. Tick the `Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox to
make the column visible in the `Packaging`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} table.

In the `Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select the
packaging-specific route. Repeat these steps for all packaging intended
to use the route.

# Product type

In Odoo, goods and services are both set up as *products*. When setting
up a new product, there are several fields that should be carefully
chosen, as they determine how to invoice and track a business\' goods or
services.

To configure an existing product, go to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the desired product from the list.
Alternatively, from the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
menu, click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a new
product.

::: seealso
[Odoo Tutorials: Product
Type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6j0ZkP5mLM)
:::

## For sale vs. purchase {#inventory/product_management/for-sale-or-purchase}

Goods and services can be designated as those that can be bought, sold,
or both. On the product form, tick the `Sales`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox if a product can be *sold* to a customer (e.g.
finished goods). Tick `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if
the product can be *purchased* (e.g. raw materials).

::: example
If a resale clothing shop buys discounted denim jackets and sells them
at a higher cost to the end consumer, the [Jacket]{.title-ref} product
form might have *both* the `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox ticked.

On the other hand, say the store occasionally sews new jackets using
denim and thread as raw materials. In the [Denim]{.title-ref} and
[Thread]{.title-ref} product forms, only `Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} should be ticked, whereas the [Handmade
Jacket]{.title-ref} product form would only tick
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
:::

## Goods vs. services

When configuring a product, a `Product Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} needs to be selected on the
`General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of a
product form. Each product type impacts different operations in other
Odoo applications, such as **Sales** and **Purchase**, and should be
chosen carefully.

- `Goods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a tangible, material
  object (e.g. anything from a hamburger to a house)
- `Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: an intangible,
  immaterial offering (e.g., a repair, a haircut, call center
  assistance)
- `Combo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: any mix of goods and
  services (e.g. a new car (*good*) with an oil change included
  (*service*))

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Due to their immaterial nature, services are not trackable in Odoo\'s
**Inventory** application.
::::

## Configure goods {#inventory/product_management/manufacture}

Selecting `Goods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as the
`Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} automatically triggers
the appearance of a few fields and tabs in the product form:

- `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab: From here,
  `purchasing and manufacturing routes <../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/use_routes>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and product logistics, such as product weight and customer
  lead time, can be specified.

- `Invoicing Policy <inventory/product_management/invoicing-policy>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} field: This field determines at what point in the sales
  process a customer is invoiced.

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  The `Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
  **only** appears if the **Sales** app is installed.
  ::::

- `Track Inventory <inventory/product_management/tracking-inventory>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} field: This checkbox determines whether Odoo tracks
  inventory for this product.

- Smart buttons: Some smart buttons appear above the form when
  `Goods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected; others show
  upon selecting a `Track Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  method. For example, `On Hand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Forecasted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} display when
  `Track Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is ticked. In
  general, most smart buttons on a product form link to
  `inventory operations
  <inventory/product_management/inventory-ops-by-product-type>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

![Designate a product as a good or service.](type/product-form.png)

### Invoicing policy {#inventory/product_management/invoicing-policy}

The `Invoicing policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field only
shows on the product form if a product is for sale (in other words, if
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is ticked, and the **Sales**
app is installed).

When configuring a product for sale, it is necessary to choose an
`invoicing policy <../../../../sales/sales/invoicing/invoicing_policy>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. When an invoicing policy of
`Ordered quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected,
customers are invoiced once the sales order is confirmed. When
`Delivered quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected,
customers are invoiced once the delivery is completed.

### Tracked vs. untracked goods {#inventory/product_management/tracking-inventory}

The `Track Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the
product form determines a lot of Odoo\'s **Inventory** operations.

*Tracked* products are those for which stock and inventory are
maintained. Examples include finished goods and, often, the raw
materials or components needed to make them.

When `Track Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is ticked, a
drop-down menu appears, offering for inventory to be tracked one of
three ways: `By Unique Serial Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `By Lots`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`By Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Configure a tracked good.](type/tracked.png)

*Untracked* products (sometimes referred to as *non-inventory* products)
are typically consumed in a short period of time, meaning that
stock/inventory does *not* need to be maintained. Non-inventory products
are often essential, but exact counts are unnecessary. Examples include:
office supplies, packaging materials, or items used in production that
do not need to be individually tracked.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Tick the `Track Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox
if it is necessary to track a product\'s stock at various locations, for
inventory valuation, with lots and/or serial numbers, or when using
reordering rules.
::::

::: seealso

### Inventory operations by product type {#inventory/product_management/inventory-ops-by-product-type}

`Whether a good is tracked or untracked <inventory/product_management/tracking-inventory>`{.interpreted-text

reordering rules.

The table below summarizes which operations (and smart buttons) are
enabled for tracked vs. untracked goods. Click highlighted chart items

#### Inventory

##### On-hand and forecasted quantities {#inventory/product_management/on-hand}

A tracked product\'s on-hand and forecasted quantities, based on
incoming and outgoing orders, are reflected on the product form with two
smart buttons:

- `fa-cubes`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `On-Hand Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This represents
  the number of units currently available in inventory. Click the button
  to view or add stock levels for a tracked product.
- `fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Forecasted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This represents the
  number of units *expected* to be available in inventory after all
  orders are taken into account. In other words,
  $\text{forecasted} = \text{on hand quantity} + \text{incoming shipments} - \text{outgoing shipments}$.
  Click the button to view the `Forecasted Report`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.

On the other hand, untracked products are regarded as *always*
available. Consequently, `On-Hand Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is not tracked, and there is no
`Forecasted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} quantity available.

##### Putaway rules and storage {#inventory/product_management/putaway}

Both tracked and untracked goods can optimize storage using:

- `fa-random`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Putaway Rules <../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/putaway>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: This represents putaway rules that apply to a good, such
  as where to store it when a new shipment arrives.
- `fa-cubes`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Storage Capacities <../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/storage_category>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: This represents any storage capacity limitations
  specified for this good. For example, a warehouse may require that
  only ten (or less) sofas be stored there at any given time, due to
  their large size.

##### Replenishment {#inventory/product_management/replenishment}

###### Reordering rules

Only tracked products can trigger
`reordering rules <../../warehouses_storage/replenishment/reordering_rules>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to generate purchase orders. Untracked goods *cannot* be
managed using reordering rules.

Reordering rules can be configured directly on the product form via the
`fa-refresh`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(refresh)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If reordering rules already exist on a product, Odoo re-labels this
button to `Min / Max`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, to show the
minimum and maximum number of units that must be in stock.
::::

###### Create purchase orders {#inventory/product_management/po}

Both tracked and untracked products can be included in a request for
quotation in the **Purchase** app. However, when receiving untracked
products, their on-hand quantity does not change upon validating the
receipt ([WH/IN]{.title-ref}).

###### Replenish smart button

The `Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button allows
all goods to be restocked directly from the product form, according to
the *Preferred Route*.

::: seealso
`Replenishment <../../warehouses_storage/replenishment>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} [Odoo Tutorials: Replenishment Methods for
Manufacturing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtjeMGcG8aM)
:::

#### Manufacturing {#inventory/product_management/manufacturing}

Both tracked and untracked products can be manufactured,
`subcontracted <../../../manufacturing/subcontracting>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, or included in another product\'s
`bill of materials (BoM) <../../../manufacturing/basic_setup/bill_configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

::: {#inventory/product_management/BoM}
On the product form for a tracked or untracked good, there are several
smart buttons that may appear for manufacturing operations:
:::

- `fa-flask`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This shows the
  BoMs used to make this product.
- `fa-level-up`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Used In`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This shows other goods
  that include this product in their BoM.

#### Transfer goods {#inventory/product_management/transfer-store}

*Transfers* are warehouse operations that involve the movement of goods.
Examples of transfers include `deliveries and receipts
<../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/receipts_delivery_one_step>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, as well as
`internal transfers <../../warehouses_storage/replenishment/resupply_warehouses>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} between warehouses.

When creating a transfer for tracked products in the **Inventory** app,
transfers modify the on-hand quantity at each location. For example,
transferring five units from the internal location
[WH/Stock]{.title-ref} to [WH/Packing Zone]{.title-ref} decreases the
recorded quantity at [WH/Stock]{.title-ref} and increases it at
[WH/Packing Zone]{.title-ref}.

For untracked products, transfers can be created, but exact quantities
at each storage location are not tracked.

#### Packages {#inventory/product_management/package}

Both tracked and untracked (non-inventory), products can be placed in
`packages <package>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

However, for non-inventory products, the quantity is not tracked, and
the product is not listed in the package\'s `Contents`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} (which can be accessed by going to `Inventory app
--> Products --> Packages`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
selecting the desired package).

![An untracked product was placed in the package, but the **Content**
section does not list
it.](type/package-content.png){alt="Show Packages page, containing the package contents list."}

Additionally, if the *Move Entire Packages* feature is enabled, moving a
package updates the location of the contained tracked products but not
the contained untracked products. To enable this feature, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Operations Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select any operation, and tick the
`Move Entire Packages`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

#### Inventory reports {#inventory/product_management/report}

**Only** tracked products appear on the following reports.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

These reports are only available to users with
`administrator access <../../../../general/users/access_rights>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
::::

- `Stock report <../../warehouses_storage/reporting/stock>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: This report provides a comprehensive list of all on-hand,
  unreserved, incoming, and outgoing tracked inventory. To access the
  report, go to
  `Inventory app --> Reporting --> Stock`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}.
- `Location report  <../../warehouses_storage/reporting/locations>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: This report shows a breakdown of which tracked products
  are held at each location (internal, external, or virtual). The report
  is only available with the *Storage Location* feature activated
  (`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}). To access it, go to
  `Inventory app --> Reporting --> Locations`{.interpreted-text

# Units of measure

In some cases, handling products in different units of measure is
necessary. For example, a business can buy products from a country that
uses the metric system, and then sell those products in a country that
uses the imperial system. In that case, the business needs to convert
the units.

Another case for unit conversion is when a business buys products in a
big pack from a supplier, and then sells those products in individual
units.

Odoo can be set up to use different *units of measure (UoM)* for one
product.

## Configuration

To use different units of measure in Odoo, first go to
`Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
under the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
activate the `Units of Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
setting. Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Enable Units of Measure in the Inventory settings.](uom/uom-enable-setting.png){.align-center}

## Units of measure categories

After enabling the *Units of Measure* setting, view the default units of
measure categories in
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> UoM Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. The category is important for unit conversion;
Odoo can convert a product\'s units from one unit to another **only** if
both units belong to the same category.

![Set units of measure categories.](uom/category.png){.align-center}

Each units of measure category has a reference unit. The reference unit
is highlighted in blue in the `Uom`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column of the `Units of Measure Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page. Odoo uses the reference unit as a base for any
new units.

To create a new unit, first select the correct category from the
`Units of Measure
Categories`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page. For example, to
sell a product in a box of six units, click the `Unit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} category line. Then, on the category page that appears,
click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Units of Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Then, in the
`Unit of Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, title the
new unit, such as [Box of 6]{.title-ref}, then in the
`Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select the appropriate
size reference, such as
`Bigger than the reference Unit of Measure`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

If applicable, enter a `UNSPSC Category`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, which is a globally recognized [code managed by
GS1](https://www.unspsc.org/), that **must** be purchased in order to
use.

In the `Ratio`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, enter how many
individual units are in the new
`UoM (Unit of Measure)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, such as
[6.00000]{.title-ref} when using the example of the [6-Pack]{.title-ref}
(since a box of six is six times *bigger* than the reference unit,
[1.00000]{.title-ref}).

![Convert products from one unit to another as long as they belong to the same category.](uom/convert-products-by-unit.png){.align-center}

## Specify a product\'s units of measure

To set units of measure on a product, first go to
`Inventory app --> Products -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select a product
to open its product form page.

In the `General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
edit the `Unit of Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
specify the unit of measure that the product is sold in. The specified
unit is also the unit used to keep track of the product\'s inventory and
internal transfers.

Edit the `Purchase UoM`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
specify the unit of measure that the product is purchased in.

## Unit conversion {#inventory/product_replenishment/unit-conversion}

Odoo automatically converts unit measurements when products have
different `UoMs (Units of
Measure)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and purchase
`UoMs (Units of Measure)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

This occurs in various scenarios, including:

1.  `Vendor orders <inventory/product_replenishment/buy-in-uom>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}: purchase `UoM (Unit of Measure)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} on purchase orders (POs) converts to
    `UoM (Unit of Measure)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} on internal
    warehouse documents
2.  `Automatic replenishment <inventory/product_replenishment/replenish>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}: generates `POs (Purchase Orders)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} when the stock levels of a product (tracked in
    `UoM (Unit of Measure)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}) dips below a
    certain level. But, the `POs (Purchase Orders)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} are created using the purchase
    `UoM (Unit of Measure)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
3.  `Sell products <inventory/product_replenishment/sell-in-uom>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}: if a different
    `UoM (Unit of Measure)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is used on
    the sales order (SO), the quantity is converted to the warehouse\'s
    preferred `UoM (Unit of Measure)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} on
    the delivery order

### Buy products in the purchase UoM {#inventory/product_replenishment/buy-in-uom}

When creating a new request for quotation (RFQ) in the *Purchase* app,
Odoo automatically uses the product\'s specified purchase unit of
measure. If needed, manually edit the `UoM`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} value on the
`RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

After the `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
is confirmed into a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, click the `Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
smart button at the top of the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

Odoo automatically converts the purchase unit of measure into the
product\'s sales/inventory unit of measure, so the
`Demand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column of the delivery
receipt shows the converted quantity.

::: example
When the product\'s purchase `UoM`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
[Box of 6]{.title-ref}, and its sales/inventory unit of measure is
[Units]{.title-ref}, the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} shows the quantity in boxes of six, and the receipt (and
other internal warehouse documents) shows the quantity in units.

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="uom/on-po.png"
alt="Image of a purchase order that is using the purchase unit of measure." />
<figcaption>An order of three quantities is placed using the purchase
"UoM": <span class="title-ref">Box of 6</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="uom/on-receipt.png"
alt="Image of receipt displaying the unit of measure." />
<figcaption>Upon warehouse receipt, the recorded quantities are in the
internal "Unit of Measure": <span
class="title-ref">Units</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
:::

### Replenishment {#inventory/product_replenishment/replenish}

A request for quotation for a product can also be generated directly
from the product form using the `Replenish`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

After clicking `Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
replenish assistant box pops up. The purchase unit of measure can be
manually edited in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, if needed. Then, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to create the
`RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

A `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can **only** be
automatically generated if at least **one** vendor is listed in the
product form\'s `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
::::

![Click Replenish button to manually replenish.](uom/replenish.png){.align-center}

Navigate to the created `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} by clicking the `Forecasted`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button on the product form. Scroll down to the
`Forecasted Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and
in the `Requests
for quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line, click the
`RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} reference
number to open the draft `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. If necessary, the purchase
`UoM (Unit of Measure)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can be edited
directly on the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

### Sell in a different UoM {#inventory/product_replenishment/sell-in-uom}

When creating a new quotation in the *Sales* app, Odoo automatically
uses the product\'s specified unit of measure. If needed, the
`UoM`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be manually edited on the
quotation.

After the quotation is sent to the customer, and confirmed into a sales
order (SO), click the `Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
smart button at the top of the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. Odoo automatically converts the unit of measure into the
product\'s inventory unit of measure, so the `Demand`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column of the delivery shows the converted quantity.

For example, if the product\'s `UoM (Unit of Measure)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} on the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
was changed to [Box of 6]{.title-ref}, but its inventory unit of measure
is [Units]{.title-ref}, the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} shows the quantity in boxes of six, and the delivery shows
the quantity in units.

# Configure product

A group of products in Odoo can be further defined using:

- `Units of measure (UoM) <configure/uom>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: a standard quantity for specifying product amounts (e.g.,
  meters, yards, kilograms). Enables automatic conversion between
  measurement systems in Odoo, such as centimeters to feet.
  - *Ex: Purchasing fabric measured in meters but receiving it in yards
    from a vendor.*
- `configure/package`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}: A physical
  container used to group products together, regardless of whether they
  are the same or different.
  - *Ex: A box containing assorted items for delivery, or a storage box
    of two hundred buttons on a shelf.*
- `configure/packaging`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}: groups the *same*
  products together to receive or sell them in specified quantities.
  - *Ex: Cans of soda sold in packs of six, twelve, or twenty-four.*

## Use cases

After comparing the various features, consider how these businesses,
with various inventory management and logistics workflows, came to their
decision.

### Pallets of items using packaging

A warehouse receives shipments of soap organized on physical pallets,
each containing 96 bars. These pallets are used for internal transfers
and are also sold as standalone units. For logistical purposes, the
pallet\'s weight must be included in the total shipping weight for
certain deliveries. Additionally, the pallet requires a barcode to
facilitate tracking, and the number of individual bars of soap must be
included in the stock count when the pallet is received.

After evaluating various options, *product packaging* was the most
suitable solution. Packaging enables assigning a barcode to a pallet,
identifying it as a \"pallet type\" containing 96 soap bars. This
barcode streamlines operations by automatically registering the grouped
quantity. Key distinctions include:

- **Warehouse tracking limitations**: Odoo tracks only the total
  quantity, not the number of packagings. For instance, if a pallet with
  12 and 24 quantities is received, Odoo records 36 quantities, not the
  pallet details.
- **Packaging barcodes are type-specific, not unique**: Barcodes
  represent packaging types (e.g., \"pallet of 96 soap bars\") but do
  not uniquely identify individual pallets, such as Pallet #1 or Pallet
  #2.

### Capture product information using barcode

An Odoo user expects the **Barcode** app to display the typical storage
location of a product by scanning a barcode for a container.

*Packages* was the most suitable. When the
`appropriate setting is enabled
<inventory/warehouses_storage/enable-package>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, scanning a package barcode displays its contents in the
**Barcode** app.

Packages represent physical containers, enabling detailed tracking of
the items they hold. Scanning a package provides visibility into its
contents and facilitates operations, like inventory moves.

### Track different units of measure in storage {#inventory/product_management/lots-uom}

A fruit juice distributor tracks multiple
`UoMs (Units of Measure)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for their
operations:

- Fruits are purchased in tons.
- Juice is produced and stored in kilograms.
- Small samples are stored in grams for recipe testing.

*Unit of Measure* was most suitable. Odoo automatically converts tons to
kilograms during receipts. However, since Odoo tracks only one
`UoM (Unit of Measure)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} per product in
the database, the company uses lot numbers to differentiate
`UoMs (Units of Measure)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}:

- LOT1: Grams (g)
- LOT2: Kilograms (kg)

Manual inventory adjustments are required to convert between lots, such
as subtracting 1 kg from LOT2 to add 1,000 g to LOT1. While functional,
this workaround can be time-consuming and prone to errors.

# Automatic inventory valuation

All of a company\'s stock on-hand contributes to the valuation of its
inventory. That value should be reflected in the company\'s accounting
records to accurately show the value of the company and all of its
assets.

By default, Odoo uses a periodic inventory valuation (also known as
manual inventory valuation). This method implies that the accounting
team manually posts journal entries, based on the physical inventory of
the company, and warehouse employees take the time to count the stock.
In Odoo, each product category reflects this, with the
`Costing Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set to `Standard
Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (not visible by
default) set to `Manual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Costing Method field is located on the Product Categories form.](inventory_valuation_config/inventory-valuation-fields.png){.align-center}

Alternatively, perpetual (automatic) inventory valuation creates
real-time *journal entries* in the *Accounting* app whenever stock
enters or leaves the company\'s warehouse.

This document is focused on the proper setup of automatic inventory
valuation, which is an integrated valuation method that ensures journal
entries in the *Accounting* app match stock valuation updates in the
*Inventory* app. For an introduction of inventory valuation in Odoo,
refer to the `using_inventory_valuation`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Switching from manual to automatic inventory valuation may cause
discrepancies between stock valuation and accounting journals.

One [successful strategy](https://www.odoo.com/r/Kvfg) for switching to
automated valuation:

1.  Clear existing stock (possibly with an `inventory adjustment
    <../../warehouses_storage/inventory_management/count_products>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"})
2.  Change the inventory valuation method to *Automatic*
3.  Return the existing stock, with the original monetary value (using
    an inventory adjustment)

Once the existing stock is recovered, the Odoo *Accounting* app
automatically generates the journal entries to corresponding stock
valuation records.
::::

## Configuration

To properly set up automatic inventory valuation, follow these steps in
Odoo:

1.  `Install Accounting app and enable specific settings
    <inventory/warehouses_storage/accounting-setup>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
2.  `Set Automatic inventory valuation on product categories
    <inventory/warehouses_storage/valuation-on-product-category>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
3.  `Set costing method <inventory/warehouses_storage/costing_methods>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

### Accounting setup {#inventory/warehouses_storage/accounting-setup}

To use automatic inventory valuation, install the *Accounting* app.
Next, go to
`Accounting app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and in the `Stock
Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, tick the
`Automatic Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.
Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note

Enabling `Automatic Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} shows
the previously invisible *Inventory Valuation* field on a product
category.
::::

![Automatic Accounting feature in Stock Valuation section of Settings page.](inventory_valuation_config/auto-accounting.png){.align-center}

Refer to the
`Expense <inventory/warehouses_storage/expense-account>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `Stock
input/output <inventory/warehouses_storage/stock-account>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} sections of documentation for details on configuring the
accounting journals shown.

### Product category setup {#inventory/warehouses_storage/valuation-on-product-category}

After
`enabling inventory valuation <inventory/warehouses_storage/accounting-setup>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, the next step is to set the product category to use
automatic inventory valuation.

Go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Product Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the desired product category. In the
`Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, set
the `Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
`Automated`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Repeat this step for
every product category intending to use automatic inventory valuation.

After enabling automatic accounting, each new stock move layer (SVL),
that is created during inventory valuation updates, generates a journal
entry.

## Costing method {#inventory/warehouses_storage/costing_methods}

After
`enabling inventory valuation <inventory/warehouses_storage/accounting-setup>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, the *costing method* for calculating and recording
inventory costs is defined on the product category in Odoo.

Go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Product Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the desired product category. In the
`Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, select
the appropriate `Costing Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:

:::::::: tabs
::: tab
Standard Price

The default costing method in Odoo. The cost of the product is manually
defined on the product form, and this cost is used to compute the
valuation. Even if the purchase price on a purchase order differs, the
valuation is the cost defined on the product form.

  Operation                          Unit Cost   Qty On Hand   Incoming Value   Inventory Value
  ---------------------------------- ----------- ------------- ---------------- -----------------
                                     \$10        0                              \$0
  Receive 8 products for \$10/unit   \$10        8             8 \* \$10        \$80
  Receive 4 products for \$16/unit   \$10        12            4 \* \$10        \$120
  Deliver 10 products                \$10        2             -10 \* \$10      \$20
  Receive 2 products for \$9/unit    \$10        4             2 \* \$10        \$40
:::

::::: tab
Average Cost (AVCO)

Calculates the valuation of a product based on the average cost of that
product, divided by the total number of available stock on-hand. With
this costing method, inventory valuation is *dynamic*, and constantly
adjusts based on the purchase price of products.

  Operation                          Unit Cost   Qty On Hand   Incoming Value   Inventory Value
  ---------------------------------- ----------- ------------- ---------------- -----------------
                                     \$0         0                              \$0
  Receive 8 products for \$10/unit   \$10        8             8 \* \$10        \$80
  Receive 4 products for \$16/unit   \$12        12            4 \* \$16        \$144
  Deliver 10 products                \$12        2             -10 \* \$12      \$24
  Receive 2 products for \$6/unit    \$9         4             2 \* \$6         \$36

How are unit cost and inventory value calculated at each step?

- When receiving four products for \$16 each:
  - Inventory value is calculated by adding the previous inventory value
    with the incoming value: $$80 + (4 * $16) = $144$.
  - Unit cost is calculated by dividing the inventory value by the
    quantity on-hand: $$144 / 12 = $12$.
- When delivering ten products, the average unit cost is used to
  calculate the inventory value, regardless of the purchase price of the
  product. Therefore, inventory value is $$144 + (-10 * $12) = $24$.
- Receive two products for \$6 each:
  - Inventory value: $$24 + (2 * $6) = $36$
  - Unit cost: $$36 / 4 = $9$

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When choosing `Average Cost (AVCO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
as the `Costing Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, changing the
numerical value in the *Cost* field for products in the respective
product category creates a new record in the *Inventory Valuation*
report to adjust the value of the product. The *Cost* amount is then
automatically updated, based on the average purchase price of both the
inventory on-hand and the costs accumulated from validated purchase
orders.
::::
:::::

::: tab
First In First Out (FIFO)

Tracks the costs of incoming and outgoing items in real-time, and uses
the real price of the products to change the valuation. The oldest
purchase price is used as the cost for the next good sold, until an
entire lot of that product is sold. When the next inventory lot moves up
in the queue, an updated product cost is used based on the valuation of
that specific lot.

This method is arguably the most accurate inventory valuation method for
a variety of reasons, but it is highly sensitive to input data and human
error.

  - First, the incoming value is calculated by multiplying the on-hand
    quantity by the purchased price: $(-8 * $10) + (-2 * $16) = -112$.
  - The inventory value is calculated by subtracting the incoming value
    from the previous inventory value: $$144 - $112 = $32$.
  - Unit cost is calculated by dividing the inventory value by the
    remaining quantity: $$32 / 2 = $16$.

- When receiving two products for \$6, inventory value is
  $$32 + $12 = $44$. Unit cost is $$44 / 4 = $11$.

Changing the costing method greatly impacts inventory valuation. It is
highly recommended to consult an accountant first before making any
adjustments here.

`using_inventory_valuation`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}

When the `Costing Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is changed,
products already in stock that were using the
`Standard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} costing method **do not**
change value; rather, the existing units keep their value, and any
product moves from then on affect the average cost, and the cost of the
product will change. If the value in the `Cost`{.interpreted-text

## Types of accounting {#inventory/warehouses_storage/accounting-types}

With automated inventory valuation set up, the generated journal entries
depend on the chosen accounting mode: *Continental* or *Anglo-Saxon*.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Verify the accounting mode by activating the
`developer-mode`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and navigating to
`Accounting app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Then, in the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar, look
for [Anglo-Saxon Accounting]{.title-ref}, to see if the feature is
enabled. If it is **not** enabled, *Continental* accounting mode is in
use.

![Show the Anglo-Saxon accounting mode feature.](inventory_valuation_config/anglo-saxon.png){.align-center}
::::

In *Anglo-Saxon* accounting, the costs of goods sold (COGS) are reported
when products are sold or delivered. This means the cost of a good is
only recorded as an expense when a customer is invoiced for a product.

So, for **manual** valuation method, set the *Expense Account* to *Stock
Valuation* for the current asset type; for **automatic** valuation
method, set the *Expense Account* to an *Expenses* or a *Cost of
Revenue* type (e.g. *Cost of Production*, *Cost of Goods Sold*, etc.).

In *Continental* accounting, the cost of a good is reported as soon as a
product is received into stock. Because of this, the *Expense Account*
can be set to **either** *Expenses* or a *Cost of Revenue* type,
however, it is more commonly set to an *Expenses* account.

Refer to the
`Expense <inventory/warehouses_storage/expense-account>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `Stock
input/output <inventory/warehouses_storage/stock-account>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} sections for details on configuring each account type.

### Expense account {#inventory/warehouses_storage/expense-account}

To configure the *expense account*, which is used in both manual and
automatic inventory valuation, go to the
`Account Properties`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
intended product category
(`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Product Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}). Then, choose an existing account from the
`Expense Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu.

# Landed costs

When shipping products to customers, the landed cost is the total price
of a product or shipment, including all expenses associated with
shipping the product.

In Odoo, the *Landed Costs* feature is used to take additional costs
into account when calculating the valuation of a product. This includes
the cost of shipment, insurance, customs duties, taxes, and other fees.

## Configuration

To add landed costs to products, the *Landed Costs* feature must first
be enabled. To enable this feature, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and scroll to the `Valuation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section.

Tick the checkbox next to the `Landed Costs`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option, and click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to save changes.

Once the page refreshes, a new `Default Journal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field appears below the `Landed
Costs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature in the
`Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

Click the `Default Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down
menu to reveal a list of accounting journals. Select a journal for which
all accounting entries related to landed costs should be recorded.

![Landed Costs feature and resulting Default Journal field in the Inventory settings.](landed_costs/integrating-landed-costs-enabled-setting.png)

## Create landed cost product

For charges that are consistently added as landed costs, a landed cost
product can be created in Odoo. This way, a landed cost product can be
quickly added to a vendor bill as an invoice line, instead of having to
be manually entered every time a new vendor bill is created.

To do this, create a new product by going to
`Inventory app --> Products -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and clicking
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Assign a name to the landed cost product in the
`Product Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field (i.e.
[International Shipping]{.title-ref}). In the
`Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, click the
drop-down menu, and select `Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
as the `Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: important
::: title

Landed cost products **must** have their
`Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set to
`Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

Click the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and tick
the checkbox next to `Is a Landed Cost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `Vendor Bills`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section. Once ticked, a new
`Default Split Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears
below it, prompting a selection. Clicking that drop-down menu reveals
the following options:

- `Equal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: splits the cost equally
  across each product included in the receipt, regardless of the
  quantity of each.
- `By Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: splits the cost
  across each unit of all products in the receipt.
- `By Current Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: splits the cost
  according to the cost of each product unit, so a product with a higher
  cost receives a greater share of the landed cost.
- `By Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: splits the cost,
  according to the weight of the products in the receipt.
- `By Volume`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: splits the cost,
  according to the volume of the products in the receipt.

![Is a Landed Cost checkbox and Default Split Method on service type product form.](landed_costs/integrating-landed-costs-landed-cost-product.png)

When creating new vendor bills, this product can be added as an invoice
line as a landed cost.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To apply a landed cost on a vendor bill, products in the original
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} **must** belong to
a *Product Category* with a *Costing Method* of either
`AVCO (Average Costing)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`FIFO (First In First Out)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and the
valuation method can be
`manual <using_inventory_valuation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} or
`automatic
<inventory_valuation_config>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
::::

## Create purchase order

Navigate to `Purchase app --> New`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to create a new request for quotation (RfQ). In
the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, add a vendor to
order products from. Then, click `Add a
product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, under the
`Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, to add products to
the `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Once ready, click `Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
confirm the order. Then, click `Receive
Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} once the products have been
received, followed by `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Create vendor bill

Once the vendor fulfills the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and sends a bill, a vendor bill can be created from the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in Odoo.

Navigate to the `Purchase app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and click into the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
for which a vendor bill should be created. Then, click
`Create Bill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This opens a new
`Vendor Bill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage.

In the `Bill Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, click the
line to open a calendar popover menu, and select the date on which this
draft bill should be billed.

Then, under the `Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click the
drop-down menu in the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column to select the previously-created landed cost product. Click the
`fa-cloud-upload`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(cloud with arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to manually
save and update the draft bill.

![Landed Costs column checkboxes for product and landed cost.](landed_costs/integrating-landed-costs-checkboxes.png)

In the `Landed Costs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, the
product ordered from the vendor does **not** have its checkbox ticked,
while the landed cost product\'s checkbox **is** ticked. This
differentiates landed costs from all other costs displayed on the bill.

Additionally, at the top of the form, a
`Create Landed Costs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button appears.

![Create Landed Costs button on vendor bill.](landed_costs/integrating-landed-costs-create-button.png)

## Add landed cost

Once a landed cost is added to the vendor bill, click
`Create Landed Costs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of
the vendor bill.

Doing so automatically creates a landed cost record, with a set landed
cost pre-filled in the product line in the
`Additional Costs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

From the `Landed Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form, click
the `Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu, and
select which transfer the landed cost belongs to.

Landed Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column displays the
landed cost, and the `New Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
displays the sum of the two, for the total cost of the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Once ready, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to post
the landed cost entry to the accounting journal.

This causes a `Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart

# Using inventory valuation

::: {#inventory/reporting/using_inventory_val}
*Inventory valuation* is a quintessential accounting procedure that
calculates the value of on-hand stock. Once determined, the inventory
valuation amount is then incorporated into a company\'s overall value.
:::

In Odoo, this process can be conducted manually--- by warehouse
employees physically counting the products--- or automatically through
the database.

## Automatic inventory valuation

To use Odoo to automatically generate a trail of inventory valuation
entries, first navigate to the `Product Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} list by going to `Inventory app --> Configuration
--> Product Categories`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
select the desired product category. On the form, set the
`Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
`Automated`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
`Costing Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to any of the three
options.

::: seealso
`Set up inventory valuation <inventory_valuation_config>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

In order to understand how moving products in and out of stock affects
the company\'s overall value, consider the following product and stock
moves scenario below.

### Receive a product

To track the value of incoming products, such as a simple *table*,
configure the product category on the the product itself. To get there,
navigate to `Inventory app --> Products -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and click the desired
product. On the product form, click the
`➡️ (right arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon beside the
`Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, which opens
an internal link to edit the product category. Next, set the
`Costing Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
`First In First Out (FIFO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
`Automated`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Alternatively access the `Product Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard by navigating to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Product Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the desired product category.
::::

Next, assume 10 tables are purchased at a price of \$10.00, each. The
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for those tables
will show the subtotal of the purchase as \$100, plus any additional
costs or taxes.

![Purchase order with 10 tables products valued at \$10.00 each.](using_inventory_valuation/purchase-order.png){.align-center}

After selecting `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
`Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button is enabled.
Clicking on this button displays a report showing how the inventory
valuation for the table was affected by this purchase.

:::: important

`Developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} **must**
be turned on to see the `Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
smart button.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The
`consignment <../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/owned_stock>`{.interpreted-text

owned by other companies are not accounted for in the host company\'s
inventory valuation.
::::

![See Valuation smart button on a receipt, with Developer mode enabled.](using_inventory_valuation/valuation-smart-button.png){.align-center}

For a comprehensive dashboard that includes the inventory valuation of
all product shipments, inventory adjustments, and warehouse operations,
refer to the `stock valuation report
<inventory/management/reporting/valuation-report>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### Deliver a product

In the same logic, when a table is shipped to a customer and leaves the
warehouse, the stock valuation decreases. The
`Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button on the
`DO (Delivery Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, likewise, displays
the stock valuation record as it does on a
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

![Decreased stock valuation after a product is shipped.](using_inventory_valuation/decreased-stock-valuation.png){.align-center}

To view the current value of all products in the warehouse, first turn
on `Developer mode
<developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and navigate to
`Inventory app --> Reporting --> Valuation`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. The `Stock Valuation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard displays detailed records of products with
the `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},

::::

### Update product unit price {#inventory/product_management/update-unit-price}

For any company: lead times, supply chain failures, and other risk
factors can contribute to invisible costs. Although Odoo attempts to
accurately represent the stock value, *manual valuation* serves as an
additional tool to update the unit price of products.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Manual valuation is intended for products that can be purchased and
received for a cost greater than 0, or have product categories set with
`Costing Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set as either
`Average Cost (AVCO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`First In First Out (FIFO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

![Add manual valuation of stock value to a product.](using_inventory_valuation/add-manual-valuation.png){.align-center}

Create manual valuation entries on the

by increasing or decreasing the unit price of each product.

:::: note

::::

![Product revaluation form adding a value of \$1.00 with the reason being inflation.](using_inventory_valuation/product-revaluation.png){.align-center}

### Inventory valuation journal entries

In Odoo, automatic inventory valuation records are also recorded in the
`Accounting
app --> Accounting --> Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} dashboard. On this comprehensive list of
accounting entries, inventory valuation records are identified by
checking values in the `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column, or looking for the `Reference`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column value which matches the warehouse operation
reference (e.g. [WH/IN/00014]{.title-ref} for receipts).

Clicking on an inventory valuation journal entry opens a *double-entry
accounting* record. These records are generated by Odoo to track the
change of value in inventory valuation as products are moved in and out
of the warehouse.

::: example
To view the inventory valuation of 10 *tables*, costing \$10.00 each,
upon reception from the vendor, go to the
`Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} page found in
`Accounting app
--> Accounting --> Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Here, click the journal line where the
`Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column value matches the
reference on the receipt, [WH/IN/00014]{.title-ref}.

![Stock valuation page depicting the products within a shipment.](using_inventory_valuation/stock-valuation-product.png){.align-center}

[Stock interim]{.title-ref} is a holding account for money intended to
pay vendors for the product. The [stock valuation]{.title-ref} account
stores the value of all on-hand stock.

feature](valuation_by_lots/product-form.png){alt="Product form showing the Valuation by Lot or Serial Number feature."}

## Valuation layers

To understand how valuation by lots and serial numbers works, consider
these scenarios:

1.  `Purchase and sell products <inventory/product_management/valuation-cost-example>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}: cost is calculated based on the *product category\'s*
    costing method.
2.  `Create new lot/serial numbers <inventory/product_management/valuation-cost-new>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} using an inventory adjustment: value of the new
    lot/serial number is assigned to the cost from the product form.
3.  Inventory adjustment to update quantities for an
    `existing lot/serial number
    <inventory/product_management/valuation-cost-existing>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}: value is assigned based on the most recent cost for
    that lot/serial number.

For both `AVCO (Average Cost)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
`FIFO (First In First Out)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} methods, the
*Cost* field on the product form is calculated using this formula:

$Avg~Cost = \frac{Total~Value}{Total~Qty}$

### Purchase products {#inventory/product_management/valuation-cost-example}

Consider how purchasing products affect the inventory valuation, in the
table below.

                                                Quantity   Lot number   Math                Average cost on product form
  --------------------------------------------- ---------- ------------ ------------------- ------------------------------
  Empty stock                                   0.00                                        \$0
  Day 1: Receive one product at \$10/unit       1.00       LOT 1        $\frac{10}{1}$      \$10
  Day 2: Receive another product at \$20/unit   1.00       LOT 2        $\frac{10+20}{2}$   \$15

![As a result, the product form displays an average cost of \$15 in the
**Cost**
field.](valuation_by_lots/lip-gloss.png){alt="Show Cost on the product form."}

### Create new lot/serial number {#inventory/product_management/valuation-cost-new}

Creating a new lot/serial number through an `inventory adjustment
<../../warehouses_storage/inventory_management/count_products>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} assigns the same value as the cost on the product form.

To make an inventory adjustment, and assign a lot number, go to
`Inventory app -->
Operations --> Physical Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

In the new inventory adjustment line that appears, set the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, create the
`Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, set the
`Counted Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`fa-floppy-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Apply`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

To view the valuation layer, go to
`Inventory app --> Reporting --> Valuation`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. The `Total Value`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} per unit matches the *Cost* on the product form.

::: example
Continuing the example in the table above, when the product cost is
[\$15]{.title-ref}, the valuation for a newly-created [LOT3]{.title-ref}
is also be [\$15]{.title-ref}.

![Show inventory adjustment valuation.](valuation_by_lots/create-new.png)
:::

### Existing lot/serial number {#inventory/product_management/valuation-cost-existing}

When adjusting the quantity of an existing lot/serial number, the value
is based on the most recent valuation layer for that specific lot/serial
number.

::: example
Continuing the example in the table above, the value for [LOT
1]{.title-ref} is [\$10]{.title-ref}.

So, when the quantity is updated from [1.00]{.title-ref} to
[2.00]{.title-ref}, the additional quantity is also valued at
[\$10]{.title-ref}, reflecting the latest valuation layer for [LOT
1]{.title-ref}.

![The inventory adjustment (top line) is valued the same as LOT 1
(bottom
line).](valuation_by_lots/existing.png){alt="Show valuation of LOT 1 getting updated."}
:::

## View valuation {#inventory/product_management/view-valuation}

To find the average cost of a specific lot/serial number, go to
`Inventory app -->
Products --> Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the desired record.

Both the `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Average Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields show a unit\'s
average cost. The `Total Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
reflects the total on-hand value for that lot/serial number.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Ensure the costing method is set to *First In First Out (FIFO)* or
*Average Cost (AVCO)* to display the cost on this page.
::::

![Lot form, displaying **Cost** field. The **Valuation** smart button is
in the
top-right.](valuation_by_lots/lot.png){alt="Show cost of the lot/serial number."}

Valuation layers of a lot/serial number can be viewed through the
`valuation report
<inventory/product_management/valuation-report>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, or by clicking the lot/serial number\'s
`Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button. These
detailed, line-by-line records can help determine how each inventory
move of the specific lot/serial number affects its valuation.

### Valuation report {#inventory/product_management/valuation-report}

Display the valuation of lots and serial numbers in the database by
going to `Inventory app --> Reporting --> Valuation`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

On the resulting `Stock Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
report, click the search bar, and in the `oi-group`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of
the resulting drop-down menu, select
`Lot/Serial number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Click the `fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(plus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the right of a
collapsed lot number line to
`manually modify the cost <inventory/product_management/update-unit-price>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

This is useful for adjusting individual lot prices when a purchase order
or bill includes multiple lots/serial numbers, as initial prices are
identical upon reception.
::::

### Valuation smart button

To access a filtered part of the *Stock Valuation* report, specific to a
lot or serial number, go to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the desired item.

On the `Lot/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page,
click the `Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button.

# Expiration dates

::: {#inventory/product_management/product_tracking/expiration_dates}
In Odoo, *expiration dates* can be used to manage and track the
lifecycles of perishable products, from purchase to sale. Using
expiration dates reduces product loss due to unexpected expiry, and
helps to avoid sending expired products to customers.
:::

In Odoo, only products that are tracked using *lots* and *serial
numbers* can be assigned expiration information. Once a lot or serial
number has been assigned, an expiration date can be set. This is
especially helpful for companies (such as food manufacturers) that
consistently, or exclusively, buy and sell perishable products.

::: seealso
\- `../product_tracking/lots`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} -
`../product_tracking/serial_numbers`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Enable expiration dates

To enable the use of *expiration dates*, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and scroll down to
the `Traceability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Then,
click the checkbox to enable the
`Lots & Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature.

Once that feature is activated, a new option will appear to enable
`Expiration Dates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click that
checkbox to enable the feature, and be sure to `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} changes.

![Enabled lots and serial numbers and expiration dates settings.](expiration_dates/expiration-dates-enabled-settings.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Once the `Lots & Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
feature is activated, an additional feature appears to
`Display Lots & Serial Numbers on Delivery Slips`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Activating these features helps with end-to-end
traceability, making it easier to manage product recalls, identify
batches of faulty products, and more.
::::

## Configure expiration dates on products

Once the `Lots & Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Expiration Dates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} features have been
enabled in the **Inventory** app settings, expiration information can be
configured on individual products.

To do so, go to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a product to edit. Selecting a product
reveals the product form for that particular item.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To be tracked using lots or serial numbers, or to configure expiration
information, products *must* have their `Product Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} set as `Goods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under
the `General
Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Then, in the
`Track Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select
either `By
Unique Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`By Lots`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

Then, click the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and
scroll down to the `Traceability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section. Tick the `Expiration Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If a product has stock on-hand prior to activating tracking by lots or
serial numbers, an inventory adjustment might need to be performed in
order to assign lot numbers to the existing stock.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

For processing large quantities of products on receipts or deliveries,
it is recommended to track using lots, so multiple products can be
traced back to the same lot, if any issues arise.
::::

![Expiration dates configuration on the product form.](expiration_dates/expiration-dates-product-configuration.png)

Under the `Dates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, there are
four categories of expiration information to configure for the product:

- `Expiration Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the number of
  days after receiving products (either from a vendor or in stock after
  production) in which goods may become dangerous and should not be used
  or consumed.
- `Best Before Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the number of
  days before the expiration date in which the goods start
  deteriorating, **without** being dangerous yet.
- `Removal Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the number of days
  before the expiration date in which the goods should be removed from
  stock.
- `Alert Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the number of days
  before the expiration date in which an alert should be raised on goods
  in a particular lot or containing a particular serial number.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The values entered into these fields automatically compute the
expiration date for goods entered into stock, whether purchased from a
vendor or manufactured in-house.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If the `Dates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is not populated
with any values for expiration information, dates (and lots) can be
manually assigned upon receipts and deliveries in and out of the
warehouse. Even when assigned, they can still be overwritten and changed
manually if needed, as well.
::::

## Set expiration dates on receipts with lots & serial numbers

Generating expiration dates for *incoming* goods can be done directly on
the `Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Navigate to
`Inventory app --> Operations --> Receipts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then click on a line to open the
`Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} record.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Clicking `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} before assigning
a serial number to the ordered product quantities causes a
`User Error`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} popup to appear. The
popup requires entry of a lot or serial number for the ordered products.
The receipt cannot be validated without an assigned lot or serial
number.

![User error popup when validating an order with no lot number.](expiration_dates/expiration-dates-user-error-popup.png)
::::

From here, click the `fa-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Details)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon located on the of
the product line. When clicked, a
`Detailed Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up will
appear.

In the pop-up, the `Expiration Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
automatically populates, based on the configuration on the product form.
Click the `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
on the appropriate line, then enter the lot or serial number.

:::: tip

the pop-up. Finally, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Detailed operations popup showing expiration dates for ordered products.](expiration_dates/expiration-dates-detailed-operations-popup.png)

A `Traceability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button will
appear upon validating the receipt. Click the
`Traceability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button to see
the updated `Traceability Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
which includes: a `Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
document; the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} being traced;
the `Lot/Serial #`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}; and more.

## Set expiration dates on manufactured products

Expiration dates can also be generated for products manufactured
in-house. To assign expiration dates to manufactured products, a
manufacturing order (MO) needs to be completed.

To create a `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
go to `Manufacturing app --> Operations
--> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Choose a product to
manufacture from the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
drop-down menu, then select the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to produce.

![Manufacturing order for product with expiration date.](expiration_dates/expiration-dates-manufacturing-order.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To manufacture a product, there must be materials to consume in the
lines in the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. This
can be achieved either by creating a `Bill of
Material`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or manually adding
materials to consume by clicking `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

Once ready, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The appropriate number of `Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} automatically populated in the field. Click the
`fa-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Details)`{.interpreted-text

specific numbers. On that pop-up, all expiration information that was
previously configured for the product is displayed.

![Components pop-up with expiration information for specific lot number.](expiration_dates/components-popup.png)

## Sell products with expiration dates

Selling perishable products with expiration dates is done the same as
any other type of product. The first step in selling perishable products
is to create a sales order.

To do that, go to `Sales app --> New`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to create a new quotation, and fill out the
information on the sales order form.

Add a `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then click
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add the desired
products to the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} lines, and
set a `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the products.

Then, click the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
Under the `Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, change
the `Delivery Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to a date after
the expected date, and click `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to confirm the date. Finally, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to confirm the sales order.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If the products are delivered before the `Alert Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} set on the product form, then no alerts are created.
::::

Next, click the `Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button at the top of the sales order to see the warehouse receipt form.

On the warehouse receipt form, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and then `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
the accompanying pop-up window, to automatically process all
`Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} quantities, and deliver the
products to the customer.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To sell perishable products with expiration dates, the
`Removal Strategy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
`Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the products are stored in
must be set to `FEFO (First Expiry, First
Out)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. If there is not enough stock of
perishable products in one lot, Odoo will automatically take the
remaining quantity required from a second lot with the next-soonest
expiration date. Removal strategies can also be set on
`Product Categories`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## View expiration dates for lots & serial numbers

To view (and/or group) all products with expiration dates by lot number,
go to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Once there, remove any default search filters from the search bar. Then,
click `Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, choose
`Add Custom Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select the
`Expiration Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} parameter from the
drop-down menu. Doing so breaks down all perishable products, their
expiration dates, and the assigned lot number.

::::

On the `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} detail
form, the `Dates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} lists all
expiration information related to the products.

If the expiration date for a lot/serial number has passed, the form
displays a red `Expiration Alert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at
the top of the page to indicate that the products in this lot are either
expired or expiring soon.

From here, click back to the `Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page (via the breadcrumbs).

To see the new expiration alert, or any expiration alerts for products
that are expired (or will expire soon), click back to the
`Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page via the
breadcrumbs. Remove all of the search filters from the search bar on the

Then, click `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and choose
`Expiration Alerts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Expiration alert for product past the expiration date.](expiration_dates/expiration-dates-expiration-alert.png)

### Expiration notifications

Users can be notified when the expiration date for a product has passed.
This can help keep specific employees up to date on the status of items
under their purview.

To configure a notification, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select a product configured with lot/serial
numbers and expiration date tracking. Navigate to the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Under the
`Logistics`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, select a user in
the `Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

When the expiation date passes for a lot/serial number for this product,
a notification is sent to the user in this field.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Once the expiration date is due, expiration alerts are created on the
form view of the lot/serial number of the product.

To customize these alerts, turn on
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, go to
`Settings app --> Technical --> Activity Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the `Alert
Date Reached`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} alert.

The `Default User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} assigned will be
notified once the expiration date is reached. If no default user is

# Lot numbers

*Lots* are one of the two ways to identify and track products in Odoo.
They typically represent a specific batch of products that were
received, stored, shipped, or manufactured in-house.

Manufacturers assign lot numbers to groups of products sharing common
properties, facilitating end-to-end traceability through their
lifecycles.

Lots are useful for managing large quantities of manufactured or
received products, aiding in tracing items back to their group,
particularly for product recalls or `expiration dates
<expiration_dates>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

<inventory/product_management/assign-lots-delivery>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, select products with specific lot numbers on the delivery
order form.

### On receipts {#inventory/product_management/assign-lots}

Assigning new or existing lot numbers to incoming goods can be done
directly on receipts.

To begin, go to the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
app to [create and confirm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_uI718P1Dc)
a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for products
tracked by lot numbers. Then, click the `Receipt`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button that appears at the top of the page to
navigate to the warehouse receipt form.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Alternatively, navigate to an existing receipt by going to the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, clicking the
`Receipts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} Kanban card, and choosing
the desired receipt.
::::

:::: important
::: title

Clicking `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} before assigning
a lot number triggers an error, indicating that a lot number **must** be
assigned before validating the receipt.

![Add lot/serial number user error popup.](lots/user-error.png)
::::

On the receipt form, on the product line in the
`Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, select the
`fa-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(list)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon to the right of the product that is tracked by lot
numbers.

![Show the bulleted list icon on the product line.](lots/list-icon.png)

Doing so opens the `Open: Stock move`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window, where the `Lot/Serial
Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are assigned.

The two ways to assign lot numbers: **manually** and **importing**.

#### Manual assignment

To manually assign lot numbers, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Input the `Lot/Serial
Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Store To`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} location for the lot, `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `Destination
Package`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, if any.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To assign multiple lot numbers, or store to multiple locations, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and type a new
`Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for additional
quantities. Repeat until the total in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column matches the `Demand`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} at the top.
::::

![Assign lot number detailed operations popup.](lots/assign-lots-popup.png)

#### Import lots

In the `Open: Stock move`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, click `Import Serials/Lots`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
then paste the bulk lot numbers, in the
`Lots/Serial numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![Lot numbers pasted to the \"Lots/Serial numbers\" field, in the
**Import Lots** pop-up
window.](lots/bulk-sn.png){alt="Lot numbers copied to the lot number line."}

Tick the `Keep current lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox to generate *additional* lot numbers in the
`Open: Stock move`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window. To
replace the lot numbers in the list, leave the
`Keep current lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option unticked.

Finally, click `Generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Once all product quantities have been assigned a lot number, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to close the pop-up window.
Then, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the receipt
form.

Odoo makes it possible to specify which lot numbers for a product are
chosen for outgoing shipment on a delivery order form.

To begin, create or select an existing quotation from the
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app. After confirming
the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
`Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button becomes
available. Click the `Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button to view the warehouse receipt form for that specific
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Alternatively, navigate to delivery orders by going to the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, and clicking
the `Delivery Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} kanban card.
::::

Clicking the `Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button
opens the the delivery order form, where lot numbers are picked for
delivery. In the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
click the `fa-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(list)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the right of the
product that is tracked by lot numbers. Clicking that icon reveals a
`Open: Stock
move`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

In the pop-up window, the chosen lot number and its storage location is
displayed in the `Pick From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column,
with the with the full `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
taken from that specific lot (if there is enough stock in that
particular lot).

If there is insufficient stock in that lot, or if partial quantities of
the `Demand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should be taken from
multiple lots, change the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
directly.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The lot automatically chosen for delivery orders varies, depending on
the selected removal strategy
(`FIFO (First In, First Out)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
`LIFO (Last In, First Out)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, or `FEFO
(First Expiry, First Out)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}). It also
depends on the ordered quantity, and whether the lot\'s on-hand quantity
is enough to fulfill the order.

## Lot management

Manage and view existing lot numbers for products in the
`Lot/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard by
going to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

By default, lot numbers are grouped by product, and selecting the
drop-down menu for each product displays the existing lot numbers.
Select a lot number to `modify or add details
<inventory/product_management/edit-lot>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
linked to the lot. Lot numbers can also be `created
<inventory/product_management/create-new-lot>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} from this page, by clicking the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

![Display lot numbers, grouped by products, on the **Lot/Serial Number**
dashboard.](lots/lot-dashboard.png){alt="Show the \"Lot/Serial Number\" dashboard."}

### Modify lot {#inventory/product_management/edit-lot}

Clicking a lot from the `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard reveals a separate page where additional
information can be provided about the lot.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Odoo automatically generates a new `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to follow the most recent number. However, it can be
edited, by clicking the line under the
`Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and
changing the generated number to any desired one.
::::

On the lot number form, the following fields can be modified:

- `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: change the lot
  number linked to the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Internal Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: records an
  alternative lot/serial number used within the warehouse that differs
  from the one used by the supplier manufacturer.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: specify the company
  where the lot number is available.
- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: add extra details
  about the lot or serial number in this text field.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

On existing lots, the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`On Hand Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields **cannot**
be modified, as the lot numbers are linked with existing stock moves.

#### Add property

To add custom fields to lots for enhanced traceability, there are two
methods of adding properties on a lot number form:

1.  Click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    `(cog)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon at the top-left of
    the page, then select `fa-cogs`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    `Add Properties`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
    drop-down menu.
2.  Click the `fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    `Add a Property`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, located
    below the existing fields.

Name and
`configure the new field </applications/essentials/property_fields>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. Once finished, enter the property value in the new field.

::: example
The new property, [Wood type]{.title-ref}, is added. The value is
recorded as [Cherry wood]{.title-ref}.

### Reserve lot number for a product {#inventory/product_management/create-new-lot}

To create a lot number for a product, begin by going to
`Inventory app --> Products
--> Lot/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Creating a lot number reserves it for a product but **does not** assign
it. To assign lot numbers, refer to the section on
`assigning lot numbers on receipts
<inventory/product_management/assign-lots>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

While Odoo automatically generates a new
`Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to follow the
most recent number, it can be edited and changed to any desired number,
by clicking the line under the `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field on the lot form, and changing the generated
number.
::::

Once the new `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
generated, click the blank field next to `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to reveal a drop-down menu. From this menu, select the
product to which this new number will be assigned.

::: example
The lot number, [000001]{.title-ref}, is created for the product,
[Drawer Black]{.title-ref}.

![New lot number creation form with assigned product.](lots/new-lot-number.png)
:::

After a new lot number has been created, saved, and assigned to the
desired product, the lot number is saved as an existing lot number
linked to the product, and can be selected when `assigning
lot numbers to products on a receipt <inventory/product_management/assign-lots>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

## Manage lots for different operations types

By default, new lots can only be created when receiving products, and
existing lot numbers cannot be used. For sales orders, only existing lot
numbers can be utilized, and new ones cannot be created on the delivery
order.

To change the ability to use new (or existing) lot numbers on any
operation type, go to the
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Operations Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the desired operation type.

On the operation type form, under the
`Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, tick
the `Create New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox to enable
new lot numbers to be created during this operation type. Choose
`Use Existing ones`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if only existing
lot numbers can be selected.

![Enabled traceability setting on operations type form.](lots/operation-type-form.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

For inter-warehouse transfers involving products tracked by lots, it can
be useful to enable the
`Use Existing Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option for warehouse receipts.
::::

## Display lots on delivery slips {#inventory/product_management/lot-traceability}

When selling products tracked with lots, it is possible to include the
lot numbers on the delivery slips sent to customers. This can be helpful
to customers in cases where lot numbers are needed, such as filing an
RMA or repair request, or registering the product.

To include lot numbers on delivery slips, open the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, and navigate to
`Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Scroll down to the `Traceability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section, tick the
`Display Lots & Serial Numbers on Delivery Slips`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox, and click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

After enabling the
`Display Lots & Serial Numbers on Delivery Slips`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} setting, lot numbers are listed on delivery slips for
products tracked by lots, once the delivery order is validated.

To view lot numbers on delivery orders and delivery slips, navigate to
the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, click on
`Delivery Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select an
order containing a product tracked using lots.

To view the lot numbers of products included in the order, make sure the
`Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab is selected, then
click the `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(adjust)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to the right of the
tab. Ensure that the `Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox is ticked, which causes a `Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column to appear. The lot number(s) for each product
included in the order are displayed in this column.

When the order is ready to be processed, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the delivery
and add product information to the delivery slip.

At the top of the order\'s form, click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Actions)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and
select `Print --> Delivery Slip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
delivery slip is then downloaded. Open the delivery slip using the
device\'s browser or file manager. Lot numbers are listed next to their
respective products in the `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column.

![The order lines section of a delivery slip, showing a product and its serial number.](lots/delivery-slip.png)

## Traceability

Manufacturers and companies can refer to traceability reports to see the
entire lifecycle of a product: where it came from, when it arrived,
where it was stored, who it went to (and when).

To see the full traceability of a product, or group by lots, go to the
`Inventory app
--> Products --> Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Doing so reveals the
`Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} dashboard.

From here, products with lot numbers assigned to them will be listed by
default, and can be expanded to show the lot numbers those products have
assigned to them.

To group by lots, begin by removing any filters in the
`Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar. Then, click the
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(caret down)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to open a
drop-down menu of `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options, and
`Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Under the
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, click the
`Add Custom Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, and select
`Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
drop-down menu.

Doing so reorganizes all the records on the page to display all existing
lots and serial numbers, and can be expanded to show all quantities of
products with that assigned number.

### Traceability report

To view a full stock moves report for a lot number, select the lot
number line from the `Lots/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text

# Reassign lot/serial numbers

Changing a product\'s tracking settings to use lots or serial numbers,
*after* storing products in Odoo without them, can lead to inconsistent
records. Follow this documentation to learn how to use an inventory
adjustment to assign lot or serial numbers to products that were not
originally assigned lots.

![Warning message: products in stock have no lot/serial number.](reassign/warning.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title

This document outlines the process of using two inventory adjustments:
one to remove incorrect records *without* lot numbers, and another to
save the quantities *with* the lot numbers.

## Change on-hand quantity to zero

To change the product\'s settings to track by lots or serial numbers,
begin by navigating to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the intended product.

Next, click the product\'s `On Hand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
smart button to open the `Update Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page. In the `On Hand Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column, change the value to zero.

numbers, restore the quantities by clicking the
`On Hand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button from the
desired product form.

On the `Update Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page,
because the on-hand quantity had been previously changed to zero, a
`No Stock On Hand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} warning appears on
the page. From here, click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button in the top-left corner. Doing so reveals a new, modifiable line
on the `Update Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page. Then,
input a desired lot number in the `Lot/Serial

# Serial numbers

*Serial numbers* are one of the two ways to identify and track products
in Odoo, along with `lots <lots>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. A
serial number is a unique identifier assigned to a product to
distinguish it from other products in a series. Serial numbers can
consist of several character types: they can contain numbers, letters,
other typographical characters, or any mix of these character types.

The goal of assigning serial numbers allows for the tracking of
individual products and their
`expiration dates <expiration_dates>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
location throughout the supply chain. For instance, serial numbers can
help manufacturers locate products to provide after-sales services or in
the event of a recall.

[Odoo Tutorials: Serial
Numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWJjWc0Vl04)
:::

## Enable lots & serial numbers {#inventory/product_management/enable-lots}

To track products using serial numbers, two settings need to be enabled:
the `Lots & Serial
Numbers traceability setting <inventory/product_management/traceability-setting>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and `serial
number usage by operation type <inventory/product_management/operation-type-setting>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### Traceability setting {#inventory/product_management/traceability-setting}

The *Lots & Serial Numbers* traceability feature *must* be enabled first
to track products. To do so, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, scroll down to the
`Traceability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and tick the
`Lots & Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.
Remember to click the `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
to save changes.

![Enabled Lots & Serial Numbers setting.](serial_numbers/enabled-setting.png)

### By operation type {#inventory/product_management/operation-type-setting}

Next, specify whether the ability to create new or use existing serial
numbers should be turned on for particular operation types (such as
shipping or receiving goods). In other words, this setting allows for
serial number tracking on warehouse receipts and delivery orders.

::: example
Enabling the *Create New* option for receipts allows new serial numbers
to be assigned as items are received. However, for delivery orders, it
is often disabled to prevent workers from accidentally assigning serial
numbers that do not exist in inventory.
:::

To enable the creation of new serial numbers on an operation, navigate
to `Inventory
app --> Configuration --> Operations Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

From the `Operations Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page,
select the desired operation type (e.g. `Receipts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Delivery Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
or `Manufacturing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), and select the
`Create New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option in the
`Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
operation type\'s configuration page.

![Show \"Create New\" option is selected on the Receipts operation type.](serial_numbers/create-new-setting.png)

## Configure serial number tracking on individual products {#inventory/product_management/detailed-operations}

Once the
`Lots & Serial Numbers setting <inventory/product_management/traceability-setting>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} has been activated, individual products can now be tracked
using serial numbers. To track a product, go to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the desired product.

In the `General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on
the product form, make sure the box next to
`Track Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is checked. Then,
select `By Unique Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the changes.
Now, existing or new serial numbers can now be selected and assigned to
newly-received or manufactured batches of this product.

![Enabled serial number tracking on product form.](serial_numbers/product-tracking.png)

## Assign serial numbers {#inventory/product_management/assign-sn}

In Odoo, serial numbers can be assigned at several times and places:

- When a product is
  `already in stock <inventory/product_management/already-in-stock>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- Via the
  `Moves smart button <inventory/product_management/moves-button>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} on a receipt
- Via the
  `Open: Stock move window <inventory/product_management/stock-move>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} on a receipt
- `During a manufacturing order
  <../../../manufacturing/basic_setup/configure_manufacturing_product>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} for a product tracked by lots/serial numbers
- When `making an inventory adjustment
  <../../warehouses_storage/inventory_management/count_products>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}

### Create new serial numbers for products already in stock {#inventory/product_management/already-in-stock}

New serial numbers can be created for products already in stock with no
assigned serial number. To do so, go to
`Inventory --> Products --> Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Doing so reveals a blank lot/serial number form. On
this form, a new `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
is generated automatically.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

While Odoo automatically generates a new lot/serial number to follow the
most recent number, it can be edited and changed to any desired number,
by clicking the line under the `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, and changing the generated number.
::::

Once the `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
generated, click the blank field next to `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to reveal a drop-down menu. From this menu, select the
product to which this new number will be assigned.

This form also provides the option to adjust the
`On Hand Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, to assign a
unique `Internal Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} number
(for additional traceability), and to assign this specific lot/serial
number configuration to a specific company in the
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. A detailed
description of this specific lot/serial number can also be added in the
`Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab below.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The `Internal Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} number field
is a space for manufacturers to input an additional unique number to
allow for easier tracking. For instance, SKU values may be used here.
::::

When all desired configurations are complete, click the
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to save all changes.

![New serial number created for existing product stock.](serial_numbers/new-serial-number.png)

After a new serial number has been created, assigned to the desired
product, and saved, navigate back to the product form, by going to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and selecting the product that this newly-created
serial number was just assigned to.

On that product\'s detail form, click the
`Lot/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button to
view the new serial number.

### Create serial numbers for incoming or outgoing products {#inventory/product_management/incoming-outgoing-products}

Serial numbers can be assigned to both incoming and outgoing goods. The
receipt and delivery order forms mirror one another; the instructions
below can be followed to assign serial numbers in either form.

- **Incoming goods:** Assign serial numbers directly on the **receipt**.
  Receipts can be accessed by navigating to
  `Inventory app --> Operations --> Receipts`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}.
- **Outgoing goods:** Assign serial numbers directly on the **delivery
  order**. Receipts can be accessed by navigating to
  `Inventory app --> Operations --> Deliveries`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Before assigning serial numbers on receipts or delivery orders, be sure
that the ability to `create new serial numbers by operations type
<inventory/product_management/operation-type-setting>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} is enabled.
::::

#### Lots/serial number field

Serial numbers can be entered directly into the
`Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on a receipt
or delivery order.

![Select value for Serial Number field on receipt.](serial_numbers/enter-in-field.png)

:::: tip

To make the `Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
visible on a receipt or delivery order, click the
`oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Adjust Settings)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, and in the
drop-down menu, tick the `Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox.

![Example **Serial Numbers** field on a delivery

::::

#### Stock move pop-up window {#inventory/product_management/stock-move}

For various methods of assigning serial numbers individually or in bulk,
click the `fa-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(list)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the product line of
a receipt.

##### Add a line

In the `Open: Stock move`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, manually enter serial numbers in the
`Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. This
method is best reserved for adding only one or a few serial numbers.

![Add a line on the stock move pop-up.](serial_numbers/stock-move-add-line.png)

##### Generate Serials/Lots {#inventory/product_management/generate-serials}

Assign multiple serial numbers at once by clicking the
`Generate Serials/Lots`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
`Open: Stock move`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

![Show generate serials pop-up.](serial_numbers/stock-move-generate-serials.png)

Doing so opens a new popup, `Generate Serial numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, which contains a few fields:

- `First SN`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Input the first serial
  number that should start the sequence. From there, Odoo automatically
  detects what pattern should be followed to generate more serial
  numbers.

- `Number of SN`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Specify the desired
  number of serial numbers to generate.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  The number of serials generated will be reflected in the
  `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on a receipt or
  delivery order. Even if the number of serial numbers generated exceeds
  the `Demand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} value, Odoo still
  allows the quantity (based on the serial numbers) to be delivered or
  received.

  ![Show how the quantity of serial numbers alters the delivery order quantity.](serial_numbers/stock-move-generate-quantity-tip.png)
  ::::

- `Keep current lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox:
  Check this box to keep existing serial numbers that may have been
  previously added. To replace existing serial numbers in the list,
  leave the box unchecked.

After filling out these fields, click the `Generate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. The newly generated serials now appear in the
`Open: Stock move`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window. By
clicking `fa-cloud-upload`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Save)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
`Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields on the
delivery order or receipt update automatically.

##### Import Serials/Lots

Another option for assigning multiple serial numbers at once is to click
the `Import
Serials/Lots`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
`Open: Stock move`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

:::: important
::: title

If the import button is not visible, ensure the
`Create New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box is checked in the
`receipt's configuration page <inventory/product_management/operation-type-setting>`{.interpreted-text

::::

Doing so opens the `Import Serials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window. Enter each serial number on a separate line in the
`Lots/Serial numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} text field.

As when
`generating serials <inventory/product_management/generate-serials>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, check the `Keep current lines`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} box to keep existing serial numbers, or leave it
unchecked to overwrite them.

:::: tip

To expedite this process, copy/paste serial numbers from an existing
spreadsheet and add them to the `Lots/Serial numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} text field.
::::

Finally, click `Generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Show import serials pop-up.](serial_numbers/stock-move-import-serials.png)

::: example
For a receipt with a `Demand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of
[3.00]{.title-ref} products, one product has already been assigned a
serial number in the `Open: Stock move`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

So, in the `Import Lots`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, two serial numbers, [124]{.title-ref} and [125]{.title-ref} are
assigned to the remaining products by entering the following in the
`Lots/Serial
numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} input field:

``` 
124
125
```

The `Keep current lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is
selected to add these two serial numbers **in addition** to the serial
number, [123]{.title-ref}, that has already been assigned.

#### Detailed operations {#inventory/product_management/moves-button}

Accessible from both receipt and delivery order forms, the *Detailed
Operations* page shows a detailed view of product movements, including
information about serial numbers, exact locations, expiration dates,
etc. This level of detail permits more precise tracking, for example,
when handling perishable or regulated goods.

To access this page, first `select a warehouse receipt or delivery order
<inventory/product_management/incoming-outgoing-products>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Then, click on the `fa-bars`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Moves`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the top of
the page.

In the `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column,
manually type (or select from the drop-down menu) the desired serial
numbers for each individual product.

![Show the detailed Moves page.](serial_numbers/moves-button.png)

When finished, click the receipt/delivery order\'s breadcrumbs, and the
assigned serial numbers are automatically saved.

## Display serial numbers on delivery slips

When selling products tracked using serial numbers, it is possible to
include the serial numbers on the delivery slips sent to customers. This
can be helpful to customers in cases where serial numbers are needed,
such as filing an RMA or repair request, or registering the product.

To include serial numbers on delivery slips, open the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, and navigate to
`Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Scroll down to the `Traceability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section, tick the
`Display Lots & Serial Numbers on Delivery Slips`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox, and click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

After enabling the
`Display Lots & Serial Numbers on Delivery Slips`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} setting, serial numbers are listed on delivery slips
for products tracked by serial numbers, once the delivery order is
validated.

To view serial numbers on delivery orders and delivery slips, navigate
to the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, click on
`Delivery Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select an
order containing a product tracked using serial numbers.

To view the serial numbers of products included in the order, make sure
the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab is selected,
then click the `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(adjust)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the right of the
tab. Ensure that the `Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox is ticked, which causes a `Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column to appear. The serial number(s) for each product
included in the order are displayed in this column.

When the order is ready to be processed, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the delivery
and add product information to the delivery slip.

At the top of the order\'s form, click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Actions)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and
select `Print --> Delivery Slip`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. The delivery slip is then downloaded. Open the
delivery slip using the device\'s browser or file manager. Serial
numbers are listed next to their respective products in the
`Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

![The order lines section of a delivery slip, showing a product and its serial number.](serial_numbers/delivery-slip.png)

## Traceability & reporting

Manufacturers and companies can refer to the *Lots/Serial Numbers*
dashboard and traceability reports to see the entire lifecycle of a
product: when and where it originated, where it was stored, and who it
was shipped to.

### Lots/Serial Numbers dashboard

To see the full traceability of a product, or group by serial numbers,
go to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Doing so reveals the
`Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

#### Reporting

On the `Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
dashboard, products with serial numbers assigned to them are listed by
default. Click the `fa-caret-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(expand)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to show which serial
numbers are assigned to the chosen product.

To group by serial numbers (or lots), first remove any default filters
from the search bar in the upper-right corner. Then, click the
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and select
`Add Custom Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which reveals a
mini drop-down menu. From this mini drop-down menu, select
`Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Doing so reveals all existing serial numbers and lots. Each row can be
expanded to show all quantities of product assigned to that serial/lot
number. For unique serial numbers that are not reused, there should be
just one product per serial number.

![Serial numbers reporting page with drop-down lists.](serial_numbers/serial-numbers-dashboard.png)

:::: tip

# Product tracking

*Lots* and *serial numbers* are the two ways to identify and track
products in Odoo. While there are similarities between the two
traceability methods, there are also notable differences that affect
receipts, deliveries, and inventory reports.

A *lot* usually indicates a specific batch of an item that was received,
is currently stored, or was shipped from a warehouse. However, it can
also pertain to a batch of products manufactured in-house, as well.

A *serial number* is a unique identifier assigned incrementally (or
sequentially) to an item or product, used to distinguish it from other
items or products.

::: seealso
\- `product_tracking/lots`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} -
`product_tracking/serial_numbers`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Enable lots & serial numbers

To track products using lots and serial numbers, the *Lots & Serial
Numbers* feature must be enabled.

To do that, go to the
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, scroll down to the
`Traceability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and click the
box next to `Lots & Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Then, click the `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to save
changes.

![Enabled lots and serial numbers feature in inventory settings.](product_tracking/differences-enabled-setting.png){.align-center}

## When to use lots

Lots are useful for products that are manufactured or received in large
quantities, such as clothes or food. Lots and can be used to trace a
product back to a group, which is especially useful when managing
product recalls or expiration dates.

::: {.example align="center" alt="Created lot with quantity of products in it."}
.. image:: product_tracking/differences-lot.png
:::

Manufacturers assign lot numbers to groups of products that have common
properties; this can lead to multiple goods sharing the same lot number.
This helps identify a number of products in a single group, and allows
for end-to-end traceability of these products through each step in their
life cycles.

## When to use serial numbers

The goal of assigning serial numbers to individual products is to make
sure every item\'s history is identifiable when it travels through the
supply chain. This can be especially useful for manufacturers that
provide after-sales services related to products they sell and deliver.

::: {.example align="center" alt="List of serial numbers for product."}
.. image:: product_tracking/differences-serial-numbers.png
:::

Serial numbers can contain many different types of characters: numbers,
letters, typographical symbols, or a mixture of all three types.

## Traceability

Manufacturers and companies can refer to traceability reports to see the
entire life cycle of a product. These reports include vital information,
like where it came from (and when), where it was stored, and to whom it
was sent.

To see the full traceability of a product, or group products by lots
and/or serial numbers, go to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Doing so reveals the
`Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

From here, products with lots or serial numbers assigned to them are
listed by default. They can also be expanded to show what lots or serial
numbers have been specifically assigned to them.

To group by lots or serial numbers, first remove any default filters
from the search bar in the upper-right corner. Then, click
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select
`Add Custom Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which reveals a
mini drop-down menu. From this mini drop-down menu, select
`Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Doing so reveals all existing lots and serial numbers, and each can be
expanded to show all product quantities with that assigned number. For
unique serial numbers that are *not* reused, there should *only* be one
product per serial number.

![Reporting page with drop-down lists of lots and serial numbers.](product_tracking/differences-tracking.png){.align-center}

:::: tip

:::

For additional information regarding an individual lot number or serial
number, click the line item for the lot or serial number to reveal that
specific number\'s `Lot`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form. From this form,
click the `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Traceability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart buttons to see
all stock on-hand using that serial number. Any operations made using
that lot or serial number can be found here, as well.

# Organize a cross-dock in a warehouse

Cross-docking is the process of sending products that are received
directly to the customers, without making them enter the stock. The
trucks are simply unloaded in a *Cross-Dock* area in order to reorganize
products and load another truck.

![image](cross_dock/cross1.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

For more information on how to organize your warehouse, read our blog:
[What is cross-docking and is it for
me?](https://www.odoo.com/blog/business-hacks-1/post/what-is-cross-docking-and-is-it-for-me-270)
::::

## Configuration

In the *Inventory* app, open
`Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
activate the *Multi-Step Routes*.

![image](cross_dock/cross2.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Doing so will also enable the *Storage Locations* feature.
::::

Now, both *Incoming* and *Outgoing* shipments should be configured to
work with 2 steps. To adapt the configuration, go to
`Inventory --> Configuration --> Warehouses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and edit your warehouse.

![image](cross_dock/cross3.png){.align-center}

This modification will lead to the creation of a *Cross-Docking* route
that can be found in
`Inventory --> Configuration --> Routes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![image](cross_dock/cross4.png){.align-center}

## Configure products with Cross-Dock Route

Create the product that uses the *Cross-Dock Route* and then, in the
inventory tab, select the routes *Buy* and *Cross-Dock*. Now, in the
purchase tab, specify the vendor to who you buy the product and set a
price for it.

![image](cross_dock/cross5.png){.align-center}

![image](cross_dock/cross6.png){.align-center}

Once done, create a sale order for the product and confirm it. Odoo will
automatically create two transfers which will be linked to the sale
order. The first one is the transfer from the *Input Location* to the
*Output Location*, corresponding to the move of the product in the
*Cross-Dock* area. The second one is the delivery order from the *Output
Location* to your *Customer Location. Both are in state*Waiting Another
Operation\* because we still need to order the product to our supplier.

![image](cross_dock/cross7.png){.align-center}

![image](cross_dock/cross8.png){.align-center}

Now, go to the *Purchase* app. There, you will find the purchase order
that has been automatically triggered by the system. Validate it and
receive the products in the *Input Location*.

![image](cross_dock/cross9.png){.align-center}

![image](cross_dock/cross10.png){.align-center}

When the products have been received from the supplier, you can go back
to your initial sale order and validate the internal transfer from
*Input* to *Output*.

![image](cross_dock/cross11.png){.align-center}

![image](cross_dock/cross12.png){.align-center}

The delivery order is now ready to be processed and can be validated
too.

# Three-step delivery

Some companies process large amounts of deliveries every day, many of
which include multiple products or require special packaging. To make
this efficient, a packing step is needed before shipping out products.
For this, Odoo has a three step process for delivering goods.

In the default three-step delivery process, products that are part of a
delivery order are picked in the warehouse according to their removal
strategy, and brought to a packing zone. After the items have been
packed into the different shipments in the packing zone, they are
brought to an output location before being shipped. These steps can be
modified if they do not fit the needs of the business.

## Configuration

To change delivery settings from
`one step <receipts_delivery_one_step>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to
three steps, make sure the *Multi-Step Routes* option is enabled in
`Inventory app --> Configuration
--> Settings --> Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Note that activating `Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} will also activate *Storage Locations*.

![Activate multi-step routes and storage locations in inventory settings.](delivery_three_steps/delivery-three-steps-multi-step-routes.png){.align-center}

Next, the warehouse needs to be configured for three step deliveries. To
do this, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Warehouses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click on the `warehouse`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to edit. Then, select
`Pack goods, send goods in output and then
deliver (3 steps)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
`Outgoing Shipments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Set outgoing shipment option to deliver in three steps.](delivery_three_steps/delivery-three-steps-outgoing-shipments.png){.align-center}

Activating three-step receipts and deliveries creates two new internal
locations: a *Packing Zone* (WH/Packing Zone), and *Output* (WH/Output).
To rename these locations, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click on the `Location`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to change, and update the name.

## Deliver in three steps (pick + pack + ship)

### Create a sales order

To create a new quote, go to `Sales app --> Create`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, which reveals a blank quotation form. On the
blank quotation form, select a `Customer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, add a storable `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

A `Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button appears in
the top right of the quotation form. Clicking it opens the picking order
to move the ordered product from [WH/Stock]{.title-ref} to [WH/Packing
Zone]{.title-ref}.

![After confirming the sales order, the Delivery smart button appears showing three items
associated with it.](delivery_three_steps/delivery-three-steps-smart-button.png){.align-center}

### Process a picking

The picking order will be created once the sales order is confirmed. To
view the picking, navigate to the `Inventory app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and locate the `Pick`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} task card on the `Inventory Overview`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard.

Click the `# To Process`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button,
which reveals the picking order generated from the previously confirmed
sales order.

Click on the picking to process. If the product is in stock, Odoo will
automatically reserve the product. Click `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to mark the picking as done, and complete the transfer
to the `Packing Zone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Picking order operation showing source location and destination location.](delivery_three_steps/delivery-three-steps-picking-order.png){.align-center}

### Process a packing

After validating the picking, the packing order is ready to process.
Click back to the `Inventory Overview`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and locate the `Pack`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} task card on the dashboard.

Click the `# To Process`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button (in
this case, `1 To Process`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}). This
reveals the packing order generated from the previously confirmed sales
order.

Click on the packing order associated with the sales order, then click
on `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to complete the
packing.

![Packing order operation showing source location and destination location.](delivery_three_steps/delivery-three-steps-packing-order.png){.align-center}

Once the packing order is validated, the product leaves the
`WH/Packing Zone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} location and moves
to the `WH/Output`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} location. Then,
the status of the document will change to `Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

### Process a delivery

Once the packing order has been validated, the delivery order is ready
to process. Navigate back to the original sales order to process the
delivery by going to `Sales app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and selecting the sales order created previously.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Delivery orders can *also* be accessed by going to
`Inventory app --> Operations
--> Deliveries`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
::::

The `Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button now
indicates there are 3 transfers, instead of one. Clicking the
`Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button shows the
three operations for this sales order: the picking, the packing, and the
delivery.

Click the delivery (WH/OUT) transfer to open the delivery order. Then,
click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Click Validate on the delivery order to transfer the product from the output location to
the customer location.](delivery_three_steps/delivery-three-steps-delivery-order.png){.align-center}

Once the delivery order is validated, the product leaves the
`WH/Output`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} location and moves to the
`Partners/Customers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} location. Then,
the status of the document will change to `Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

# Dropshipping

Dropshipping is an order fulfillment strategy that allows sellers to
have items shipped directly from suppliers to customers. Normally, a
seller purchases a product from a supplier, stores it in their
inventory, and ships it to the end customer once an order is placed.
With dropshipping, the supplier is responsible for storing and shipping
the item. This benefits the seller by reducing inventory costs,
including the price of operating warehouses.

## Configure products to be dropshipped

To use dropshipping as a fulfillment strategy, navigate to the
`Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app and select
`Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Under the `Logistics`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading, click
the `Dropshipping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox, and
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to finish.

Next, go to the `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app,
click `Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
and choose an existing product or select `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to configure a new one. On the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, make sure that the
`Can be Sold`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Can be Purchased`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkboxes are
enabled.

![Enable the \"Can be Sold\" and \"Can be Purchased\" checkboxes on the product form.](dropshipping/sold-purchased-checkboxes.png){.align-center}

Click on the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and
specify a vendor and the price that they sell the product for. Multiple
vendors can be added, but the vendor at the top of the list will be the
one automatically selected for purchase orders.

![The product form with a vendor specified.](dropshipping/product-vendor-config.png){.align-center}

Finally, select the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
and enable the `Dropship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox in
the `Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

![Enable the Dropship option in the product inventory tab.](dropshipping/enable-dropship-route.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

While it is not necessary to enable the `Buy`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} route in addition to the `Dropship`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} route, enabling both provides the option of
dropshipping the product or purchasing it directly.
::::

## Fulfill orders using dropshipping

When a sales order is created for a dropshipped product, an associated
request for quotation (RfQ) is automatically generated to purchase the
product from the vendor. Sales orders can be viewed in the
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app by selecting
`Orders --> Orders`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Click the
`Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the top
right of a sales order to view the associated
`RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

![A dropship sales order with the Purchase smart button in the top right corner.](dropshipping/dropship-sales-order.png){.align-center}

Once the `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
confirmed, it becomes a purchase order, and a dropship receipt is
created and linked to it. The receipt can be viewed by clicking the
`Dropship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button in the
top-right corner of the purchase order form.

![A dropship purchase order with the Receipt smart button in the top right corner.](dropshipping/dropship-purchase-order.png){.align-center}

The dropship receipt displays `Partners/Vendors`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `Source Location`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, and `Partners/Customers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `Destination Location`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. Upon delivery of the product to the customer,
click on the `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the
top-left of the dropship receipt to confirm the delivered quantity.

![Validate the dropship receipt after delivery.](dropshipping/validate-dropship-receipt.png){.align-center}

To view all dropship orders, simply navigate to the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
`Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard and click the
teal `# TO PROCESS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
`Dropship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} card.

![Click the green button on the Dropship card to view all dropship orders.](dropshipping/view-all-dropship-orders.png){.align-center}

# Consignment: buy and sell stock without owning it

Most of the time, products stored in a company\'s warehouse are either
purchased from suppliers, or are manufactured in-house. However,
suppliers will sometimes let companies store and sell products in the
company\'s warehouse, without having to buy those items up-front. This
is called *consignment*.

Consignment is a useful method for suppliers to launch new products, and
easily deliver to their customers. It\'s also a great way for the
company storing the products (the consignee) to earn something back for
their efforts. Consignees can even charge a fee for the convenience of
storing products they don\'t actually own.

## Enable the consignment setting

To receive, store, and sell consignment stock, the feature needs to be
enabled in the settings. To do this, go to
`Inventory --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and under the `Traceability`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, check the box next to
`Consignment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and then click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to finish.

![Enabled Consignment setting in Inventory configuration.](owned_stock/owned-stock-enable-consignment.png){.align-center}

## Receive (and store) consignment stock

With the feature enabled in Odoo, consignment stock can now be received
into a warehouse. From the main `Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} dashboard, click into the
`Receipts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Then, click
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Consignment stock is not actually purchased from the vendor; it is
simply received and stored. Because of this, there are no quotations or
purchase orders involved in receiving consignment stock. So, *every*
receipt of consignment stock will start by creating manual receipts.
::::

Choose a vendor to enter in the `Receive From`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, and then choose the same vendor to enter in the
`Assign Owner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Since the products received from the vendor will be owned by the same
vendor, the `Receive From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Assign Owner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields must match.
::::

Once the vendor-related fields are set, enter products into the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} lines, and set the
quantities to be received into the warehouse under the
`Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. If the
`Units of Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature is
enabled, the `UoM (Units of Measure)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can
be changed, as well. Once all the consignment stock has been received,
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the receipt.

![Matching vendor fields in consignment Receipt creation.](owned_stock/owned-stock-receipt-fields.png){.align-center}

## Sell and deliver consignment stock

Once consignment stock has been received into the warehouse, it can be
sold the same as any other in-stock product that has the
`Can Be Sold`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option enabled on the
product form.

To create a sales order, navigate to the `Sales`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} app, and from the `Quotations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} overview, click `Create`{.interpreted-text

selecting `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to validate the
delivery.

## Traceability and reporting of consignment stock

Although consignment stock is owned by the vendor who supplied it, and
not by the company storing it in their warehouse, consignment products
will *still* appear in certain inventory reports.

To find inventory reports, go to
`Inventory --> Reporting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
choose a report to view.

:::: note

inventory valuation.
::::

### Product moves report

To view all information about on-hand stock moves, navigate to the
`Product Moves`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard by going to
`Inventory --> Reporting --> Product Moves`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. For consignment products, the information in this
report is the same as any other product: the history of its product
moves can be reviewed; the `Quantity Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
document are available; and its `Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} are available, as well. The consignment stock will
originate from `Partner Location/Vendors`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

### Stock on hand report

View the `Stock On Hand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard by
navigating to `Inventory -->
Reporting --> Inventory Report`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
From this report, the `Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of
all stock on-hand are displayed, in addition to the quantities per
location. For consignment products, the `Owner`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column will be populated with the owner of those
products, or the original vendor who supplied the products in the first
place.

# Putaway rules

Putaway is the process of routing products to appropriate storage
locations upon shipment arrival.

Odoo can accomplish this seamlessly using *putaway rules*, which dictate
how products move through specified warehouse locations.

Upon shipment arrival, operations are generated based on putaway rules
to efficiently move products to specified locations, and ensure easy
retrieval for future delivery orders.

In warehouses that process specific kinds of products, putaway rules can
also prevent volatile substances from being stored in close proximity,
by directing them to different locations determined by the warehouse
manager.

::: seealso
[Odoo Tutorials: Putaway
Rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCQMf6sj_w8)
:::

## Configuration

To use putaway rules, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and activate the
`Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature under the
`Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. By doing so, the
`Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature is also
automatically activated.

Finally, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Activate Multi-Step Routes in Inventory configuration settings.](putaway/activate-multi-step-routes.png)

### Define putaway rule {#inventory/routes/putaway-rule}

To manage where specific products are routed for storage, navigate to
`Inventory app
--> Configuration --> Putaway Rules`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Use the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button to configure a new putaway rule on a `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Product Category`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} that the rule affects.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Putaway rules can be defined either per product/product category, and/or
package type (the *Packages* setting must be enabled in
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} for that).
Additionally, a `storage category <storage_category>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} can be defined to limit capacities of a storage location and
route products accordingly.
::::

In the same line, the `When product arrives in`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} location is where the putaway rule is triggered to
create an operation to move the product to the
`Store to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} location.

For this to work, the `Store to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
location must be a *sub-location* of the first (e.g.,
[WH/Stock/Fruits]{.title-ref} is a specific, named location inside
[WH/Stock]{.title-ref} to make the products stored here easier to find).

::: example
In a warehouse location, **WH/Stock**, there are the following
sub-locations:

- WH/Stock/Fruits
- WH/Stock/Vegetables

Ensure all apples are stored in the fruits section by filling the field
`Store to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with the location
[WH/Stock/Fruits]{.title-ref} when the `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, [Apple]{.title-ref} arrives in [WH/Stock]{.title-ref}.

Repeat this for all products and hit `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Create putaway rules for apples and carrots.](putaway/create-putaway-rules.png)
:::

Use the `Sublocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
specify whether to use a sublocation or specify a storage category:

- `No`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: no sublocation is used.
  Products are directed to whatever is specified in the
  `Store to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
- `Last Used`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the last location that
  had a move associated with it for that product or product category is
  used. If there is no last location used, the destination is whatever
  is specified in the `Store to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  field.
- `Closest Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the locations
  specified as part of a storage category are used. A storage category
  is mandatory in the `Having Category`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field.

To apply a putaway rule to *all* products, create an empty putaway rule
with no specified `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. All products are
stored in the location specified in the `Store to`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

A best practice for an empty putaway rule is to specify the
`Last used`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`Sublocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Specifying
`Last used`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} ensures that Odoo
suggests the last location used to store a product.
::::

### Putaway rule priority

Odoo selects a putaway rule based on the following priority list (from
highest to lowest) until a match is found:

1.  Package type and product
2.  Package type and product category
3.  Package type
4.  Product
5.  Product category

::: example
The product [Lemonade can]{.title-ref} has the following putaway rules
configured:

1.  When receiving a [Pallet]{.title-ref}
    (`Package Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) of [Lemonade
    cans]{.title-ref}, it is redirected to
    [WH/Stock/Pallets/PAL1]{.title-ref}.
2.  [Lemonade can]{.title-ref}\'s `Product Category`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} is [All/drinks]{.title-ref}, and when receiving a
    [Box]{.title-ref} of any item in this product category, items are
    redirected to [WH/Stock/Shelf 1]{.title-ref}.
3.  Any product on a [Pallet]{.title-ref} is redirected to
    [WH/Stock/Pallets]{.title-ref}
4.  The product [Lemonade can]{.title-ref} is redirected to
    [WH/Stock/Shelf 2]{.title-ref}
5.  Items in the [All/drinks]{.title-ref} product category are
    redirected to [WH/Stock/Small Refrigerator]{.title-ref}.

# One-step receipt and delivery

In Odoo *Inventory*, both incoming and outgoing shipments are configured
to process in one step, by default. This means purchases will be
received directly into stock, and deliveries will be moved directly from
stock to customers.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Incoming and outgoing shipments do **not** need to be configured with
the same amount of steps.

For example, a warehouse\'s settings can be configured so products can
be received directly in one step, and delivered in three steps (pick +
pack + ship).
::::

## Configuration

To configure one-step receipts and deliveries for a warehouse, navigate
to `Inventory
app --> Configuration --> Warehouses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a warehouse to edit.

Under the `Warehouse Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, set `Incoming Shipments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Receive goods directly (1 step)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and set `Outgoing Shipments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Deliver goods directly (1 step)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Incoming and outgoing shipments set to one-step on warehouse form.](receipts_delivery_one_step/receipts-delivery-one-step-warehouse-settings.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Since one-step receipt and delivery is the default for incoming and
outgoing shipments in Odoo, the *Multi-Step Routes* feature is *not*
required.

However, for the `Shipments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} settings
to appear on a warehouse form, the feature **must** be enabled.

To enable *Multi-Step Routes*, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Under the
`Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, tick the
checkbox next to `Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so also
activates the `Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
feature.
::::

## Receive goods directly (1 step) {#inventory/receipts_delivery_one_step/wh}

When products are received in one step, they will move from the vendor
location to warehouse stock in the database immediately upon validation
of a purchase order (PO).

### Create purchase order

To create a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
navigate to the `Purchase app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This opens a blank
`Request for Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (RfQ) form.

Add a vendor in the `Supplier`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
Then, fill out the various fields on the
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, as
necessary.

![Filled out new request for quotation form.](receipts_delivery_one_step/receipts-delivery-one-step-new-rfq.png){.align-center}

Under the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select a product
to add to the `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

Once ready, click `Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
This moves the `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} to the `Purchase Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
stage.

Once the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
confirmed, a `Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button
appears at the top of the form. Clicking the smart button opens the
warehouse receipt (WH/IN) form.

![Receipt smart button on confirmed purchase order form.](receipts_delivery_one_step/receipts-delivery-one-step-receipt-smart-button.png){.align-center}

### Process receipt

From the warehouse receipt form, the products ordered can be received
into the warehouse. To receive the products, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Once validated, the
receipt moves to the `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage.

![Validated warehouse receipt in Done stage.](receipts_delivery_one_step/receipts-delivery-one-step-done-receipt.png){.align-center}

Click back to the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
(via the breadcrumbs, at the top of the form) to view the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form. On the

role="guilabel"} column now matches the ordered
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Deliver goods directly (1 step) {#inventory/delivery/one-step}

When products are delivered in one step, they will move from warehouse
stock to the customer location in the database immediately upon
validation of a sales order (SO).

### Create sales order

To create a `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, navigate
to the `Sales app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This opens a blank sales
quotation form.

Add a customer in the `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. Then, fill out the various fields on the sales quotation form, as
necessary.

![Filled out new sales quotation form.](receipts_delivery_one_step/receipts-delivery-one-step-new-sales-order.png){.align-center}

Under the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select a product
to add to the sales order quotation.

Once ready, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This
moves the quotation to the `Sales Order`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} stage.

Once the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is confirmed,
a `Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button appears at
the top of the form. Clicking the smart button opens the warehouse
delivery (WH/OUT) form.

![Delivery smart button on confirmed sales order form.](receipts_delivery_one_step/receipts-delivery-one-step-delivery-button.png){.align-center}

### Process delivery

From the warehouse delivery form, the products ordered by the customer
can be delivered from the warehouse. To deliver the products, change the
value in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
match the ordered quantity in the `Demand`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

Once ready, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Once
validated, the delivery order moves to the `Done`{.interpreted-text

# Two-step receipt and delivery

Depending on a company\'s needs, receiving and shipping products in and
out of the warehouse might require multi-step operations. In Odoo
*Inventory*, this can be done using *Multi-Step Routes*.

In the two-step receipt process, products are received in an input area,
then transferred to stock. This kind of process for incoming shipments
might be beneficial for warehouses with specific storage locations, such
as freezers and refrigerators, secured locked areas, or special aisles
and shelves.

Products can be sorted according to where they are going to be stored,
and employees can stock all the products going to a specific location.
The products are *not* available for further processing, until they are
transferred into stock.

In the two-step delivery process, products are first picked from their
respective location in the warehouse, then transferred to an output
location before being shipped to the customer.

This might be beneficial for companies using a First In, First Out
(FIFO), Last In, First Out (LIFO), or First Expired, First Out (FEFO)
removal strategy.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Incoming and outgoing shipments do **not** need to be configured with
the same amount of steps.

For example, a warehouse\'s settings can be configured so products can
be received in two steps (input + stock), and delivered in three steps
(pick + pack + ship).
::::

## Configuration

In Odoo *Inventory*, both incoming and outgoing shipments are configured
to process in one step, by default. To change these settings, the
*Multi-Step Routes* feature must be enabled.

To enable *Multi-Step Routes*, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Under the
`Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, tick the
checkbox next to `Multi-Step
Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so also activates the
`Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature.

![Enabled Multi-Step Routes feature in Inventory app settings.](receipts_delivery_two_steps/receipts-delivery-two-steps-settings.png){.align-center}

Next, configure a warehouse for two-step receipts and deliveries.
Navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Warehouses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a warehouse to edit.

Under the `Warehouse Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, set `Incoming Shipments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Receive goods in input and then stock (2 steps)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and set `Outgoing Shipments`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to
`Send goods in output and then deliver (2 steps)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Incoming and outgoing shipments set to two-step on warehouse form.](receipts_delivery_two_steps/receipts-delivery-two-steps-shipments.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Selecting two-step receipts and deliveries automatically creates new
*Input* and *Output* warehouse locations in the database, named
[WH/Input]{.title-ref} and [WH/Output]{.title-ref}, respectively.

To rename or edit these locations, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration
--> Locations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select the
desired location.

On the location\'s form, change the `Location Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and make any other necessary changes.
::::

## Process receipt in two steps (input + stock)

When products are received in two steps, they first move from the vendor
location to an input location. Then, they move from the input location
to warehouse stock in the database, upon validation of a purchase order
(PO), and a subsequent internal transfer.

### Create purchase order

To create a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
navigate to the `Purchase app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This opens a blank
`Request for Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (RfQ) form.

Add a vendor in the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
Then, fill out the various fields on the
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, as
necessary.

![Filled out new Request for Quotation from vendor.](receipts_delivery_two_steps/receipts-delivery-two-steps-new-rfq.png){.align-center}

Under the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select a product
to add to the `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

Once ready, click `Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
This moves the `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} to the `Purchase Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
stage.

Once the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
confirmed, a `Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button
appears at the top of the form. Clicking the smart button opens the
warehouse receipt (WH/IN) form.

![Delivery smart button for validated purchase order.](receipts_delivery_two_steps/receipts-delivery-two-steps-smart-button.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

For businesses with multiple warehouses that have different step
configurations, the `Deliver To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field on the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form
**must** be specified as the correct *input location* connected to the
two-step warehouse.

This can be done by selecting the warehouse from the drop-down menu that
includes the [Receipts]{.title-ref} label at the end of the name.
::::

### Process receipt

From the warehouse receipt form, the products ordered can be received
into the warehouse. To receive the products, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Once validated, the
receipt moves to the `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage,
and the products move to the `WH/Input`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} location.

![Receipt form for products ordered from vendor.](receipts_delivery_two_steps/receipts-delivery-two-steps-receipt-form.png){.align-center}

Click back to the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
(via the breadcrumbs, at the top of the form) to view the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form. On the
product line, the quantity in the `Received`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column now matches the ordered
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Process internal transfer

Once the receipt is validated, an internal transfer is created and ready
to process.

To view the internal transfer, navigate to the
`Inventory app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and locate the
`Internal Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} task card.

Click the `# To Process`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on
the task card to reveal a list of all internal transfers to process, and
select the transfer associated with the previously validated receipt.

Once ready, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
complete the transfer, and move the product from
`WH/Input`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`WH/Stock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Once the transfer is validated, the products enter inventory, and are
available for customer deliveries or manufacturing orders.

![Internal transfer form for products ordered from vendor.](receipts_delivery_two_steps/receipts-delivery-two-steps-internal-transfer.png){.align-center}

## Process delivery order in two steps (pick + ship) {#inventory/shipping_receiving/two-step-delivery}

When products are delivered in two steps, they move from warehouse stock
to an output location. Then, they move from the output location to a
customer location in the database, upon validation of a picking order,
and a subsequent delivery order (DO).

### Create sales order

To create a `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, navigate
to the `Sales app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This opens a blank sales
quotation form.

Add a customer in the `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. Then, fill out the various fields on the sales quotation form, as
necessary.

# Three-step receipt

Some companies require a quality control process before receiving goods
from suppliers. To accomplish this, Odoo has a three-step process for
receiving goods.

In the three-step receipt process, products are received in an input
area, then transferred to a quality area for inspection. Products that
pass the quality inspection are then transferred into stock. The
products are not available for further processing until they are
transferred out of the quality area and into stock.

## Configuration

Odoo is configured by default to `receive and deliver goods in one step
<receipts_delivery_one_step>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, so the
settings need to be changed in order to utilize three-step receipts.
First, make sure the *Multi-Step Routes* option is enabled in `Inventory
--> Configuration --> Settings --> Warehouse`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Note that activating
`Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} will also
activate *Storage Locations*.

![Activate multi-step routes and storage locations in Inventory settings.](receipts_three_steps/receipts-three-steps-multi-step-routes.png){.align-center}

Next, the warehouse needs to be configured for three-step receipts. To
do that, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Warehouses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the desired warehouse to be edited.
Doing so reveals the detail form for that specific warehouse.

On that `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} detail form page,
select `Receive goods in input, then
quality and then stock (3 steps)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
`Incoming Shipments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Set incoming shipment option to receive in three steps.](receipts_three_steps/receipts-three-steps-incoming-shipments.png){.align-center}

Activating three-step receipts and deliveries creates two new internal
locations: *Input* (WH/Input), and *Quality Control* (WH/Quality
Control). To rename these locations, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then click on the desired location to change (or
update) the name.

## Receive in three steps (input + quality + stock)

### Create a purchase order

To create a new `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, navigate to `Purchase app -->
New`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, which reveals a blank
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form page.
On this page, select a `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, add
a storable `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

A `Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button will appear
in the top right, and the receipt will be associated with the purchase
order. Clicking on the `Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
smart button will show the receipt order.

![After confirming a purchase order, a Receipt smart button will appear.](receipts_three_steps/receipts-three-steps-smart-button.png){.align-center}

### Process a receipt

Once the purchase order (PO) is confirmed, a receipt
([WH/IN]{.title-ref}) operation is generated and ready to process.

The receipt can be confirmed from the original purchase order form, or
it can be accessed by navigating to the
`Inventory app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and locating
the `Receipts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} task card.

Click the `# To Process`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
reveal all incoming receipts to process. Click the receipt associated
with the previous purchase order.

Click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to validate the
receipt, and move the product to the destination location,
`WH/Input`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Receipt operation for product being moved to WH/Input location.](receipts_three_steps/receipts-three-steps-receipt-form.png){.align-center}

### Process a transfer to Quality Control

Once the receipt has been validated, an internal transfer operation to
move the product to quality control is ready to process.

Click `Inventory Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
breadcrumbs to navigate back to the dashboard, and locate the
`Internal Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} task card.

Select the `# To Process`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
reveal all internal transfers to process. Then, choose the internal
transfer associated with the validated receipt.

Once ready, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
complete the transfer, and move the product from
`WH/Input`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`WH/Quality Control`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Internal transfer for product being moved to quality control zone.](receipts_three_steps/receipts-three-steps-internal-transfer.png){.align-center}

## Process a transfer to stock

Once the internal transfer to move the product to quality control has
been validated, another internal transfer operation to move the product
into warehouse stock is ready to process.

Click `YourCompany: Internal Transfers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the breadcrumbs to reveal the list of all internal
transfers to process. Then, select the new internal transfer to move the
product from [WH/Quality Control]{.title-ref} to [WH/Stock]{.title-ref}.

Once ready, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
complete the transfer, and move the product from
`WH/Quality Control`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`WH/Stock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Sell stock from multiple warehouses using virtual locations

While keeping stock and selling inventory from one warehouse might work
for smaller companies, bigger companies might need to keep stock in, or
sell from, multiple warehouses in multiple locations.

Sometimes products included in a single sales order might take stock
from two (or more) warehouses; in Odoo, pulling products from multiple
warehouses to satisfy sales demands can be done using *virtual
locations*.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The solution in this document, describing the use of a virtual warehouse
to fulfill orders for multiple warehouses, has some limitations.
Consider the following before proceeding:

1.  When the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set
    to a virtual warehouse on a sales order, the virtual warehouse\'s
    address is indicated on the picking, packing, and delivery forms,
    **not** the actual warehouse\'s address.
2.  Each location has a [warehouse_id]{.title-ref} (hidden field). This
    means that the stock in the virtual warehouse will **not** be the
    sum of the stock of the real warehouses, but rather the sum of the
    stock in the locations whose warehouse ID is the virtual warehouse.
::::

:::: danger

Potential limitation for those using `two
<../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/receipts_delivery_two_steps>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} or `three-step
delivery <../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/delivery_three_steps>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}:

1.  The output or packing zone on the various forms is incorrectly
    listed as the virtual warehouse\'s address.
2.  There is no workaround for two or three-step deliveries.
3.  Proceed **only** if setting a virtual warehouse\'s address as the
    output or packing zone makes sense for the company\'s workflow.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In order to create virtual locations in warehouses, and proceed to the
following steps, the `Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} features **must** be enabled.

To do so, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, scroll down to the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, and enable the
`Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options. Then,
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the changes to finish.
::::

## Create virtual parent location {#inventory/routes/virtual-wh}

Before creating any virtual stock locations, create a new warehouse that
acts as a *virtual* warehouse --- the *parent* location of other
physical warehouses.

::: spoiler
Why a \"virtual\" warehouse?

Virtual warehouses are great for companies with multiple physical
warehouses. This is because a situation might arise when one warehouse
runs out of stock of a particular product, but another warehouse still
has stock on-hand. In this case, stock from these two (or more)
warehouses could be used to fulfill a single sales order.

The \"virtual\" warehouse acts as a single aggregator of all the
inventory stored in a company\'s physical warehouses, and is used (for
traceability purposes) to create a hierarchy of locations in Odoo.
:::

To create a new warehouse, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Warehouses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. From here, the warehouse `Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Short Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can
be changed, and other warehouse details can be changed under the
`Warehouse
Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

Lastly, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to finish
creating a *regular* warehouse. Continue following the steps below to
finish configuring the virtual parent warehouse.

## Create child warehouses {#inventory/routes/child-wh}

Create at least two *child* warehouses to link to the virtual warehouse.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

In order to take stock from multiple warehouses to fulfill a sales
order, there needs to be at least **two** warehouses acting as child
locations of the virtual parent location warehouse.
::::

To do that, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Warehouses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and follow the
`preceding instructions <inventory/routes/virtual-wh>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to configure the physical stock locations.

::: example
| **Parent Warehouse**
| `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: [Virtual
  Warehouse]{.title-ref}
| `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: [VWH/Stock]{.title-ref}

| **Child Warehouses**
| `Warehouses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: [Warehouse
  A]{.title-ref} and [Warehouse B]{.title-ref}
| `Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: [WHA]{.title-ref} and
  [WHB]{.title-ref}

![Graphic of child locations \'WHA\' and \'WHB\' tied to the parent location.](stock_warehouses/parent-location.png){.align-center}
:::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

While the virtual stock location will be changed to \'View\' later, the
`Location Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} **must** be
`Internal Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at this point to
`link the child warehouses
<inventory/routes/link-to-vwh>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} in the
next section.
::::

## Link child warehouses to virtual stock {#inventory/routes/link-to-vwh}

To set physical warehouses as child locations of the virtual location
configured in the
`previous step <inventory/routes/virtual-wh>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, navigate to `Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Locations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Remove any filters from the search bar. Then, click the physical
warehouse `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that was
previously created to be a child location (e.g. [WHA]{.title-ref}), and
click `Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Change the `Parent Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
from `Physical Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the
virtual warehouse\'s **stock location** (e.g. [VWH/Stock]{.title-ref})
from the drop-down menu, and click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To select the virtual warehouse\'s stock location in the
`Parent Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu, the
parent warehouse stock location (e.g. [VWH/Stock]{.title-ref}) **must**
have its `Location Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set to
`Internal Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

![Set the child warehouse\'s \*Parent Location\* to the virtual warehouse.](stock_warehouses/configure-physical-wh.png){.align-center}

Repeat the preceding steps to configure two or more child warehouses.

Once complete, the virtual, parent warehouse (e.g.
[VWH/Stock]{.title-ref}) fulfills orders using stock from child
warehouses (e.g. [WHA]{.title-ref} and [WHB]{.title-ref}), if there is
insufficient stock in any one location.

## Set virtual stock location as \'view\'

Set the virtual stock location\'s `Location Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to `View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, as it is
a non-existent location used to group various physical warehouses
together.

To do that, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Click the virtual warehouse\'s stock location (e.g.
[VWH/Stock]{.title-ref}) that was `previously created
<inventory/routes/virtual-wh>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, from the
`Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list.

On the location form, under the
`Additional Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading, set
the `Location Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} the changes.

![Display stock across all linked warehouses.](stock_warehouses/on-hand.png){.align-center}
::::

## Example: sell products from a virtual warehouse

To sell products from multiple warehouses using a virtual parent
location, the database must have at least **two** warehouses configured
--- with at least **one** product, with quantity on-hand in each
warehouse, respectively.

::: example
The following product, [Toy soldier]{.title-ref}, is available at each
location with the quantities:

- [WHA/Stock]{.title-ref} : 1
- [WHB/Stock]{.title-ref} : 2
- Warehouses [WHA]{.title-ref} and [WHB]{.title-ref} are child
  warehouses of the virtual warehouse [VWH]{.title-ref}.
:::

Create a quotation for the product by navigating to the
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app and clicking
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. On the quote, add a
`Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add the two
products stored in the two warehouses.

Then, click the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on
the sales order form. Under the `Delivery`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, change the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field value to the virtual warehouse that was
`previously created <inventory/routes/virtual-wh>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Next, `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the
sales order.

![Set virtual warehouse as the \*Warehouse\* field in sales order\'s \*Other Info\* tab.](stock_warehouses/set-virtual-wh.png){.align-center}

Then, click the `Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button. From the warehouse delivery form, confirm that the
`Source Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} value matches the
`Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field value from the
sales order. Both should list the virtual warehouse location.

Finally, on the warehouse delivery form, under the
`Detailed Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, confirm
that the `Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column for each product match
the child locations that are tied to the virtual parent location.

![Delivery order with matching source and child locations.](stock_warehouses/delivery-order.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Source Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
warehouse delivery form, and the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} under the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab on the sales order, **must** match for products in
the sales order to be pulled from different warehouses.

- If the virtual warehouse is not in the
  `Source Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the
  warehouse delivery form, retry product reservation by:
  - Running the scheduler: turn on
    `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
    then go to
    `Inventory app --> Operations --> Run Scheduler`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
  - Clicking `Check Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on
    the delivery order.
- If the virtual warehouse is **not** assigned to the
  `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the sales
  order, then cancel it, and create a new sales order with the virtual
  warehouse set in the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  field.
- If the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is missing
  on the sales order form, then the multiple child warehouses may not
  have been set up correctly. Review the `previous section
  <inventory/routes/child-wh>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to ensure
  the correct settings.

To use a virtual *parent* location as the default warehouse for sales
orders, each salesperson should have the virtual warehouse assigned to

# Storage categories

A *storage category* is used with
`putaway rules <putaway>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to assign a
storage location to incoming products while accounting for the capacity
of that location.

Follow these steps to complete the setup:

1.  `Enable features in the settings <inventory/routes/enable-storage-categories>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
2.  `Define capacity limitations <inventory/routes/define-storage>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
3.  Assign a
    `category to storage locations <inventory/routes/assign-location>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
4.  Add the storage category as an attribute to a `putaway rule
    <inventory/routes/set-putaway-attribute>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

::: seealso
`putaway`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Assigning categories to storage locations tells Odoo these locations
meet specific requirements, such as temperature or accessibility. Odoo
then evaluates these locations, based on defined capacity, and
recommends the best one on the warehouse transfer form.
::::

## Configuration {#inventory/routes/enable-storage-categories}

To enable storage categories, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, in the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, ensure the
`Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} features are
enabled.

If intending to set capacities by
`package type <inventory/routes/set-capacity-package>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, also make sure `Packages`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is enabled. Click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Enable Storage Locations and Multi-Step Routes to enable storage categories.](storage_category/enable-categories.png)

## Define storage category {#inventory/routes/define-storage}

A storage category with specific limitations **must** be created first,
before it is applied to locations, in order to decide the optimal
storage location.

To create a storage category, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Storage
Categories`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

On the storage category form, type a name for the category in the
`Storage Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Options are available to limit capacity by weight, product, and package
type.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Weight limits can be combined with capacity by package or product (e.g.
a maximum of one hundred products with a total weight of two hundred
kilograms).

While it is possible to limit capacity by product and package type at
the same location, it may be more practical to store items in different
amounts across various locations, as shown in this example of
`capacity by package <inventory/routes/set-capacity-package>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

The `Allow New Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field defines
when the location is considered available to store a product:

- `If location is empty`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a product
  can be added there only if the location is empty.
- `If products are the same`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a
  product can be added there only if the same product is already there.
- `Allow mixed products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: several
  different products can be stored in this location at the same time.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

When clicked, the `oi-arrows-v`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button shows which
storage locations the category has been assigned to.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo does **not** automatically split quantities across multiple storage
locations. If an incoming receipt contains several units or packages and
the first recommended location exceeds its capacity, Odoo still routes
all items to that same location instead of selecting another one with
available space.

*(Example: If a location can hold 10 units and 12 units arrive, all 12
are still assigned to that location.)*
::::

### Capacity by weight

On a storage category form (`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Storage
Categories`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}), set a maximum
product weight in the `Max Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. This limit applies to each location assigned this storage
category.

This value must be set to greater than [0]{.title-ref} if a product
weight is defined.

### Capacity by product

In the `Capacity by Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
click `Add a Line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to input items,
and enter their capacities in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

::: example
Ensure only a maximum of five [Large Cabinets]{.title-ref} and two
[Corner Desk Right Sit]{.title-ref} are stored at a single storage
location, by specifying those amounts in the
`Capacity by Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of a
storage category form.

![Show storage category limiting by product count.](storage_category/capacity-by-product.png)
:::

### Capacity by package {#inventory/routes/set-capacity-package}

For companies using
`packages <../../product_management/configure/package>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, it becomes possible to ensure real-time storage capacity
checks, based on package types (e.g., crates, bins, boxes, etc.).

Create the
`package type <inventory/warehouses_storage/package-type>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} before assigning it to a storage category. Create it on the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the product form
(in the `Packaging`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section), or
create it from the `Product Packagings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page. Be sure to set the
`Package Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: example
Create putaway rules for pallet-stored items, by creating the [High
frequency pallets]{.title-ref} storage category.

In the `Capacity by Package`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
specify the number of packages for the designated
`Package Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and set a maximum of
[2.00]{.title-ref} [Pallets]{.title-ref} for a specific location.

![Create a storage category.](storage_category/storage-category.png)
:::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo does **not** automatically split quantities across multiple storage
locations. If an incoming receipt contains several units or packages and
the first recommended location exceeds its capacity, Odoo still routes
all items to that same location instead of selecting another one with
available space.

*(Example: If a location can hold 10 units and 12 units arrive, all 12
are still assigned to that location.)*
::::

## Assign to location {#inventory/routes/assign-location}

Once the storage category is created, assign it to a location. Navigate
to the location by going to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the desired location. Then, select the
created category in the `Storage Category`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

::: example
Assign the [High frequency pallets]{.title-ref} storage category (which
limits pallets stored at any location to two pallets) to the
[WH/Stock/Pallets/PAL1]{.title-ref} sub-location.

![When a Storage Category is created, it can be linked to a warehouse location.](storage_category/location-storage-category.png)
:::

## Putaway rule {#inventory/routes/set-putaway-attribute}

With the
`storage category <inventory/routes/define-storage>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `location
<inventory/routes/assign-location>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} set
up, create the `putaway rule <putaway>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} by
navigating to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Putaway Rules`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to create the
putaway rule. Specify a location to store to in the
`Store to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Use the `Sublocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
specify that you want to use a sublocation with the storage category:

- `Last Used`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The last location that
  had a move associated with it for that product or product category is
  used. If there is no last location used, the destination is whatever
  is specified in the `Store to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  field.
- `Closest Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The locations
  specified as part of the storage category are used. A storage category
  is mandatory in the `Having Category`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field.

::: example
Continuing the example from above, the [High frequency
pallets]{.title-ref} storage category is assigned to the putaway rule
directing pallets of lemonade to locations with the [High frequency
pallets]{.title-ref} storage category
`assigned to them <inventory/routes/assign-location>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

![Storage Categories used in putaway rules.](storage_category/smart-putaways.png)
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If products are not routing to secondary locations for a storage
category and a product weight is defined, verify that the storage
category\'s `Max Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} value is set
to a number greater than [0]{.title-ref}.
::::

## Use case: limit capacity by package

To limit the capacity of a storage location by a specific number of
packages, `create a storage
category with a Capacity By Package <inventory/routes/set-capacity-package>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Continuing the example from above, the [High frequency
pallets]{.title-ref} storage category is assigned to the
[PAL1]{.title-ref} and [PAL2]{.title-ref} locations.

Then, `putaway rules <inventory/routes/putaway-rule>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are set, so that any pallets received in the warehouse are
directed to be stored in [PAL1]{.title-ref} and [PAL2]{.title-ref}
locations.

Depending on the number of pallets on-hand at each of the storage
locations, when two pallets of lemonade cans is received, the following
scenarios happen:

- If [PAL1]{.title-ref} and [PAL2]{.title-ref} are empty, the pallet is
  redirected to [WH/Stock/Pallets/PAL1]{.title-ref}.

- If [PAL1]{.title-ref} is full, the pallet is redirected to
  [WH/Stock/Pallets/PAL2]{.title-ref}.

- If [PAL1]{.title-ref} and [PAL2]{.title-ref} are full, the pallet is
  redirected to [WH/Stock/Pallets]{.title-ref}.

- If [PAL1]{.title-ref} is partially full (for example, with one
  pallet), Odoo treats more than one received pallet as a single pallet
  on the receipt. You must manually separate the two pallets into
  separate storage locations. Click the `fa-list`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} `Open Move`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to
  the right of the `Units`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and
  then in the `Open: Stock move`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box,
  click `Add a
  line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Finally, split the receipt
  by quantity into separate locations, then click
  `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Routes and push/pull rules

*Routes* in Odoo control the movement of products between different
locations, whether internal or external, using push and pull rules. Once
set up, these rules help automate the logistics of product movement
based on specific conditions.

::::

## About routes and terminology

In a generic warehouse, there are receiving docks, a quality control
area, storage locations, picking and packing areas, and shipping docks.
All products go through all these locations. As the products move
through the locations, each location triggers the products\' specified
route and rules.

![View of a generic warehouse with stock and quality control area.](use_routes/stock-example.png){.align-center}

In this example, vendor trucks unload pallets of ordered products at the
receiving docks. Operators then scan the products in the receiving area.
Depending on the product\'s route and rules, some of these products are
sent to a quality control area (for example, products that are
components used in the manufacturing process), while others are directly
stored in their respective locations.

![View of a generic push to rule when receiving products.](use_routes/push-to-rule-example.png){.align-center}

Here is an example of a fulfillment route. In the morning, items are
picked for all the orders that need to be prepared during the day. These
items are picked from storage locations and moved to the picking area,
close to where the orders are packed. Then, the orders are packed in
their respective boxes, and conveyor belts bring them to the shipping
docks, ready to be delivered to customers.

![View of a generic pull from rule when preparing deliveries.](use_routes/pull-from-rule-example.png){.align-center}

### Push rules

Push rules are used to *supply products into a storage locations* as
soon as they arrive at a specific receiving location.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Push rules can only be triggered if there are no pull rules that have
already generated the product transfers.
::::

In a
`one-step receipt route <receipts_delivery_one_step>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, which uses one push rule, when a product arrives in the
warehouse, a push rule can automatically transfer it to the *Storage
Location*. Different push rules can be applied to different products,
allowing for customized storage locations.

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="use_routes/push-rule.png"
alt="Rule for a Receive in one step route." />
<figcaption>Push rule for the 'Receive in one step' route.</figcaption>
</figure>

For more information about configuring rules, skip to the
`Configure rules section
<inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-rules>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### Pull rules

Pull rules trigger product moves on demand, such as a sales order or a
`need to restock
<../../warehouses_storage/replenishment/reordering_rules>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

Pull rules work backward from the demand location. For example, in a
`two-step delivery
<inventory/shipping_receiving/two-step-delivery>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} route, where items move from *Stock* to *Output* before
being delivered to the *Customer Location*, the pull rule first creates
a transfer from *Output* to the customer. If the product is not at
*Output*, another pull rule creates a transfer from *Stock* to *Output*.
The warehouse workers then process these transfers in the reverse order:
picking, then shipping.

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="use_routes/pull-rule.png" alt="Example pull rule." />
<figcaption>Pull rules for the 'Deliver in two steps'
route.</figcaption>
</figure>

For more information about configuring rules, skip to the
`Configure rules section
<inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-rules>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

## Configuration {#use-routes/routes-rules}

Since *Routes* are a collection of *Push and Pull Rules*, Odoo helps you
manage advanced route configurations such as:

- Manage product manufacturing chains.
- Manage default locations per product.
- Define routes within the stock warehouse according to business needs,
  such as quality control, after-sales services, or supplier returns.
- Help rental management by generating automated return moves for rented
  products.

To configure a route for a product, first, open the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} application and go to
`Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Then, in the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
enable the `Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
feature and click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Activate the Multi-Step Routes feature in Odoo Inventory.](use_routes/multi-steps-routes-feature.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature is
automatically activated with the `Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} feature.
::::

Once this first step is completed, the user can use pre-configured
routes that come with Odoo, or they can create custom routes.

### Pre-configured routes

To access Odoo\'s pre-configured routes, go to
`Inventory --> Configuration -->
Warehouses`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Then, open a
warehouse form. In the `Warehouse Configuration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, the user can view the warehouse\'s pre-configured
routes for `Incoming Shipments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Outgoing Shipments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![A pre-configured warehouse in Odoo Inventory.](use_routes/example-preconfigured-warehouse.png){.align-center}

Some more advanced routes, such as pick-pack-ship, are also available.
The user can select the route that best fits their business needs. Once
the `Incoming Shipments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Outgoing Shipments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} routes are set,
head to `Inventory --> Configuration
--> Routes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} to see the specific
routes that Odoo generated.

![View of all the preconfigured routes Odoo offers.](use_routes/preconfigured-routes.png){.align-center}

On the `Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, click on a
route to open the route form. In the route form, the user can view which
places the route is `Applicable On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
The user can also set the route to only apply on a specific
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This is useful for
multi-company environments; for example, a user can have a company and
warehouse in Country A and a second company and warehouse in Country B.

::: seealso
`Applicable on packagings <inventory/product_management/packaging-route>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
:::

![View of a route example applicable on product categories and warehouses.](use_routes/routes-example.png){.align-center}

At the bottom of the route form, the user can view the specific
`Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the route. Each
`Rule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} has an
`Action`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
`Source Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a
`Destination Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![An example of rules with push & pull actions in Odoo Inventory.](use_routes/rules-example.png){.align-center}

### Custom Routes

To create a custom route, go to
`Inventory --> Configuration --> Routes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click on `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Next, choose the places where this route can be
selected. A route can be applicable on a combination of places.

![View of a pick-pack-ship route.](use_routes/advanced-custom-route.png){.align-center}

Each place has a different behavior, so it is important to tick only the
useful ones and adapt each route accordingly. Then, configure the
`Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the route.

If the route is applicable on a product category, the route still needs
to be manually set on the product category form by going to
`Inventory --> Configuration --> Product
Categories`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Then, select the
product category and open the form. Next, click `Edit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and under the `Logistics`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, set the `Routes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

When applying the route on a product category, all the rules configured
in the route are applied to **every** product in the category. This can
be helpful if the business uses the dropshipping process for all the
products from the same category.

![View of a route applied to the \"all\" product category.](use_routes/routes-logistic-section.png){.align-center}

The same behavior applies to the warehouses. If the route can apply to
`Warehouses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, all the transfers
occurring inside the chosen warehouse that meet the conditions of the
route\'s rules will then follow that route.

![View of the warehouse drop-down menu when selecting applicable on warehouse.](use_routes/applicable-on-warehouse.png){.align-center}

If the route is applicable on `Sales Order Lines`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, it is more or less the opposite. The route must be
manually chosen when creating a quotation. This is useful if some
products go through different routes.

Remember to toggle the visibility of the `Route`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column on the quotation/sales order. Then, the route
can be chosen on each line of the quotation/sales order.

![View of the menu allowing to add new lines to sales orders.](use_routes/add-routes-to-sales-lines.png){.align-center}

Finally, there are routes that can be applied to products. Those work
more or less like the product categories: once selected, the route must
be manually set on the product form.

To set a route on a product, go to
`Inventory --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the desired product. Then, go to the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and under the
`Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, select the
`Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![View of a product form, where the route must be selected.](use_routes/on-product-route.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Rules must be set on the route in order for the route to work.
::::

#### Rules {#inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-rules}

The rules are defined on the route form. First, go to
`Inventory --> Configuration
--> Routes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and open the desired
route form. Next, click `Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and in
the `Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, click on
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![View of the rules menu, where it is possible to add new rules.](use_routes/add-new-rules.png){.align-center}

The available rules trigger various actions. If Odoo offers *Push* and
*Pull* rules, others are also available. Each rule has an
`Action`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:

- `Pull From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this rule is triggered
  by a need for the product in a specific location. The need can come
  from a sales order being validated or from a manufacturing order
  requiring a specific component. When the need appears in the
  destination location, Odoo generates a picking to fulfill this need.
- `Push To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this rule is triggered
  by the arrival of some products in the defined source location. In the
  case of the user moving products to the source location, Odoo
  generates a picking to move those products to the destination
  location.
- `Pull & Push`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this rule allows the
  generation of pickings in the two situations explained above. This
  means that when products are required at a specific location, a
  transfer is created from the previous location to fulfill that need.
  This creates a need in the previous location and a rule is triggered
  to fulfill it. Once the second need is fulfilled, the products are
  pushed to the destination location and all the needs are fulfilled.
- `Buy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: when products are needed at
  the destination location, a request for quotation is created to
  fulfill the need.
- `Manufacture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: when products are
  needed in the source location, a manufacturing order is created to
  fulfill the need.

![Overview of a \"Pull From\" rule that creates a transfer between the stock and the packing
zone.](use_routes/pull-from-rule-stock-to-packing.png){.align-center}

The `Operation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must also be
defined on the rule. This defines which kind of picking is created from
the rule.

If the rule\'s `Action`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
`Pull From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Pull & Push`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
`Supply Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be set. The
`Supply Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} defines what happens
at the source location:

- `Take From Stock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the products are
  taken from the available stock of the source location.
- `Trigger Another Rule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the system
  tries to find a stock rule to bring the products to the source
  location. The available stock is ignored.
- `Take From Stock, if Unavailable, Trigger Another Rule`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: the products are taken from the available stock of
  the source location. If there is no stock available, the system tries
  to find a rule to bring the products to the source location.

## Example flow

In this example, let\'s use a custom *Pick - Pack - Ship* route to try a
full flow with an advanced custom route.

First, a quick look at the route\'s rules and their supply methods.
There are three rules, all `Pull From`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} rules. The `Supply Methods`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for each rule are the following:

- `Take From Stock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: When products
  are needed in the `WH/Packing Zone`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, *picks* (internal transfers from
  `WH/Stock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
  `WH/Packing Zone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) are created from
  `WH/Stock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to fulfill the need.
- `Trigger Another Rule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: When
  products are needed in `WH/Output`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  *packs* (internal transfers from `WH/Packing Zone`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to `WH/Output`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"})
  are created from `WH/Packing Zone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  to fulfill the need.
- `Trigger Another Rule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: When
  products are needed in `Partner
  Locations/Customers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, *delivery
  orders* are created from `WH/Output`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to fulfill the need.

![Overview of all the transfers created by the pick - pack - ship route.](use_routes/transfers-overview.png){.align-center}

This means that, when a customer orders products that have a *pick -
pack - ship* route set on it, a delivery order is created to fulfill the
order.

![View of the operations created by a pull from transfer.](use_routes/operations-on-transfers.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the source document for multiple tranfers is the same sales order,
the status is not the same. The status will be
`Waiting Another Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if the
previous transfer in the list is not done yet.
::::

![View of the transfers\' various statuses at the beginning of the process.](use_routes/waiting-status.png){.align-center}

To prepare the delivery order, packed products are needed at the output
area, so an internal transfer is requested from the packing zone.

![View of the detailed operations for a transfer between the packing and output zones.](use_routes/detailed-operations-2.png){.align-center}

Obviously, the packing zone needs products ready to be packed. So, an
internal transfer is requested to the stock and employees can gather the
required products from the warehouse.

![View of the detailed operations for a transfer between the stock and packing zones.](use_routes/detailed-operations-transfer.png){.align-center}

As explained in the introduction of the documentation, the last step in
the process (for this route, the delivery order) is the first to be
triggered, which then triggers other rules until we reach the first step
in the process (here, the internal transfer from the stock to the
packing area). Now, everything is ready to be processed so the customer
can get the ordered items.

In this example, the product is delivered to the customer when all the
rules have been triggered and the transfers are done.

![View of the transfers\' statuses when the route is completed.](use_routes/transfers-status.png){.align-center}

# Inbound and outbound flows

Configuring inbound and outbound flows in Odoo is key to optimizing
efficiency, traceability, and cost. Warehouse managers must balance
speed and control, choosing between a streamlined process or added
checkpoints.

Odoo offers one-step, two-step, and three-step flows, with more steps
providing greater control but increasing operations. The best setup
depends on quality checks, packaging, and warehouse size.

This guide helps businesses determine the most suitable configuration.

## One-step flow

The *one-step inventory flow* is the simplest option, with minimal
handling steps and the least traceability. In this setup, products move
directly from vendors to stock or from stock to customers, with Odoo
only tracking when items enter or leave the warehouse. This makes it
ideal for businesses with high-volume, low-risk products or fast-moving
operations where additional validation steps aren't necessary.

- **Receiving**: Products go directly into stock.
- **Shipping**: Products ship directly from stock.
- **Best for**: Small warehouses, low stock levels, and non-perishable
  items, where minimal processing is needed before products are stored
  or shipped.

::: seealso
`daily_operations/receipts_delivery_one_step`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Two-step flow

A *two-step flow* adds an input or output area for processing products
before storage or shipment. Incoming goods can be unboxed and inspected
before shelving, while outgoing shipments are sorted and consolidated
before dispatch. This setup improves efficiency by assigning storage
teams to picking and stocking, while dedicated teams handle unboxing,
(possibly) packing, and final verification to reduce order fulfillment
errors.

- **Receiving**: Products move to an *input* area before being
  transferred into stock.
  - Until transferred, received products are not automatically reserved
    for manufacturing, shipping, or other operations.
- **Shipping**: Products move to an *output* before shipping to allow
  for `sorting or
  consolidation <picking_methods>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
- **Best for**: Large warehouses, high stock levels, bulky items, and
  workflows that separate receiving from storage to improve organization
  and efficiency.

::: seealso
`daily_operations/receipts_delivery_two_steps`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Three-step flow

A three-step flow builds on the two-step process by adding a quality
check and packing area, enforcing stricter processes and improving
oversight.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

While this setup enhances process control, separating picking and
packing requires validation at each step. If the same person handles
both, it may cause redundancy and slow operations.

Quality checks and packing do not require a three-step flow. Enable
`quality control points
<../../quality/quality_management/quality_control_points>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} separately or activate the
`Packages feature <inventory/warehouses_storage/enable-package>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} in Odoo to incorporate these processes without adding extra
transfer steps.
::::

- **Receiving**: Products follow a structured process: *input area* →
  *quality control* → *stock*.
- **Shipping**: Products are *picked*, *packed*, and then *shipped*,
  ensuring proper handling and organization.
- **Best for**: Very large warehouses with strict quality control
  requirements, dedicated picking and packing workflows, and a need for
  clear traceability across multiple handling stages. Suitable when
  multiple teams manage different steps before products are stocked or
  shipped.

# Batch picking

::: {#inventory/misc/batch_picking}
*Batch picking* enables a single picker to handle multiple orders at
once, reducing the number of times needed to navigate to a warehouse
location. When picking in batches, orders are grouped and consolidated
into a picking list. After the picking, the batch is taken to an output
location, where the products are sorted into their respective delivery
packages.
:::

Since orders *must* be sorted at the output location after being picked,
this picking method suits businesses with a few products that are
ordered often. Storing high-demand items in easily accessible locations
can increase the number of orders that are fulfilled efficiently.

Batch picking is ideal for industries or warehouses that handle high
order volumes with a stable demand. This method increases efficiency by
allowing workers to pick items for multiple orders in one trip through
the warehouse, reducing travel time and boosting productivity.

## Configuration

To activate the batch picking option, begin by going to
`Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Under the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, check
the `Batch,
Wave & Cluster Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box.

![Enable the \*Batch Transfers\* in Inventory \> Configuration \> Settings.](batch/batch-transfer-checkbox.png)

Since batch picking is a method to optimize the *pick* operation in
Odoo, the `Storage
Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options under the
`Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading must also be
checked on this settings page. When finished, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Enable \*Storage Locations\* and \*Multi-Step Routes\* Inventory \> Configuration \> Settings.](batch/locations-routes-checkbox.png)

\-
`Delivery in two steps <../daily_operations/receipts_delivery_two_steps>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} -
`../daily_operations/delivery_three_steps`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Create batch transfers

To manually group transfers directly from the
`Inventory app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, hover over the
desired operation type from the `Inventory Overview`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} menu (e.g. the `Receipts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} Kanban card), click the
`fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(vertical ellipsis)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, then
select `Prepare Batch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Inventory dashboard with the Prepare Batch option highlighted.](batch/prepare-batch.png)

On the batch transfer form, fill the following fields out accordingly:

- `Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: employee assigned to
  the picking. Leave this field blank if *any* worker can fulfill this
  picking.
- `Operation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: from the
  drop-down menu, select the operation type under which the picking is
  categorized.
- `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: specifies the
  date by which the `Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  person should complete the transfer to the output location.

::: seealso
To learn more about the `Dock Location`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Vehicle
Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields, see
`dispatch management system
<../../shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/dispatch>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
:::

Next, in the `Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open the `Add:
Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window.

If the `Operation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field was
filled, the list will filter transfer records matching the selected
`Operation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to create a
new transfer.

Once the transfer records are selected, click
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the batch
picking.

::: example
A new batch transfer is assigned to the `Responsible`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, [Joel Willis]{.title-ref}, for the [Pick]{.title-ref}
`Operation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
`Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to [August
11]{.title-ref}.

![View of \*Batch Transfers\* form.](batch/batch-transfer-form.png)

Clicking the `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
opens the `Add:Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window,
displaying only pickings. This is because the
`Operation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} was set to
[Pick]{.title-ref} on the batch transfer form.

Click the checkbox to the left of the transfers,
[WH/PICK/00001]{.title-ref} and [WH/PICK/00002]{.title-ref}, to include
them in the new transfer. Then, click the `Select`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to close the `Add:Transfers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} window.

![Select multiple transfers from the \*Add:Transfers\* window.](batch/add-transfers-window.png)
:::

### Add batch from transfers list {#inventory/warehouses_storage/add-batch-transfers}

Another method of creating batch transfers is available using the
`Add to batch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option in a list.
Navigate to the `Inventory app --> Operations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} drop-down menu, and select any of the
`Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open a filtered list
of transfers.

![Show all transfer types in a drop-down menu: Receipts, Deliveries, Internal Transfers,
Manufacturings, Batch Transfers, Dropships.](batch/transfers-drop-down.png)

On the transfers list, select the checkbox to the left of the selected
transfers to add in a batch. Next, navigate to the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, and click `Add to batch`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the resulting drop-down menu.

![Use \*Add to batch\* button, from the \*Action\* button\'s list.](batch/add-to-batch.png)

Doing so opens an `Add to batch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window, wherein the employee `Responsible`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for the picking can be assigned.

Choose from the two radio options to add to
`an existing batch transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
create `a new batch transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Add a `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for this batch.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field can be used
to add additional information to help workers identify the source of the
batch, where to place the batch, what shipping containers to use, etc.
::::

To create a batch to be processed at a later time, select the
`Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

Conclude the process by clicking `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Show \*Add to batch\* window to create a batch transfer.](batch/add-to-batch-window.png)

### Automatic batches

Batches can be automatically created and assigned based on several
criteria. The *Automatic Batches* option is defined on the *operation
type* level.

::: example
In a multi-steps delivery process, the picking operation can be grouped
by customer, while the shipping operation can be organized by carrier
and destination country.
:::

To enable *Automatic Batches*, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Operation Types`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select the
desired operation type (e.g. `Delivery`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Pick`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, etc). Then,
select one or more `Batch Grouping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
criteria by ticking the appropriate checkbox. Even if more than one
grouping option is selected, only one batch is created.

Batches can be automatically generated based on the following criteria:

- `Contact`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Carrier`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Destination Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Source Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Destination Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

![The Batch and Wave Transfers settings page with the Auto batch grouping criteria visible.](batch/auto-batch-grouping.png)

## Process batch transfer

Handle batch transfers in the
`Inventory app --> Operations --> Batch Transfers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} page.

From here, select the intended transfer from the list. Then, on the
batch transfer form, input the `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
quantities for each product, under the
`Detailed Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Finally,
select `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to complete the
picking.

:::: tip

Tip
:::

Be certain the batch transfer is complete when the
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is highlighted in
purple. If the `Check Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button is highlighted instead, that means there are items in the batch
that are currently *not* available in-stock.

::: example
In a batch transfer involving products from pickings,
[WH/PICK/00001]{.title-ref} and [WH/PICK/00002]{.title-ref}, the
`Detailed Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab shows that
the product, [Cabinet with Doors]{.title-ref}, has been picked because
the `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column matches the value
in the `Reserved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. However,
[0.00]{.title-ref} quantities have been picked for the other product,
[Cable Management Box]{.title-ref}.

# Cluster picking

::: {#inventory/misc/cluster_picking}
:::

Cluster picking is an advanced picking method that combines the
efficiency of `batch picking
<inventory/misc/batch_picking>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} with
immediate sorting during the picking process. It is best suited for
warehouses with high order volumes where organization and speed are
critical.

Unlike batch picking, which requires a separate sorting step after
picking, cluster picking sorts items directly into designated bins or
containers for each *sales order* (SO). This eliminates the need for
post-picking consolidation, making it ideal for operations prioritizing
speed and accuracy.

Cluster picking is particularly effective in environments where
immediate organization is crucial, and orders contain a mix of items
that need precise sorting during, rather than after, the picking
process.

However, cluster picking does have some disadvantages. For instance,
urgent orders cannot be prioritized, and optimized batches must be
manually created beforehand. As a result, the picking process can lead
to bottlenecks.

:::: {#inventory/misc/cluster_picking/example}
::: example
#\. `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 1 calls for one
apple and orange #. `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 2
calls for one apple and banana #. `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} 3 calls for one apple, orange, and banana

Apples are stored in Shelf A, oranges in Shelf B, and bananas in Shelf
C.

To pick products for three orders at once, the cart is loaded with three
empty packages.

Starting at Shelf A, the picker places apples into each package. Next,
the picker navigates to Shelf B, and places oranges in the packages
designated for `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 1 and
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 3. Finally, the picker
pushes the cart to Shelf C, and loads packages for
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 2 and
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 3 with a banana, each.

With the packages for all three `SOs (Sales Orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} packed, the picker pushes the cart to the output location,
where the packages are sealed and prepared for shipment.

![Show example of fulfilling sales orders 2 and 3 at once.](cluster/cluster-example.png)
:::
::::

## Configuration

To enable cluster picking, begin by navigating to
`Inventory app --> Configuration
--> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Under the
`Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading, activate the
`Packages`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Batch, Wave & Cluster Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
options.

![Activate \*Packages\* and \*Batch Transfers\* features in the settings.](cluster/configs.png)

Since batch picking is used to optimize the *pick* operation in Odoo,
the `Storage
Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options, under
the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading, must also be
checked on this settings page.

*Storage locations* allow products to be stored in specific locations
they can be picked from, while *multi-step routes* enable the picking
operation itself.

When finished, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Enable \*Storage Locations\* and \*Multi-Step Routes\* Inventory \> Configuration \> Settings.](cluster/locations-routes-checkbox.png)

### Packages setup {#inventory/misc/create-package}

To configure the containers to be used during the picking process,
navigate to `Inventory app --> Products --> Packages`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to create a new package.

On the new package form, the `Package Reference`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is pre-filled with the next available
[PACK]{.title-ref} number in the system. `Pack Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is automatically set to the creation date of the form.

Set the `Package Use`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
`Reusable Box`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
`Packages <../../product_management/configure/package>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

::: example
A package intended for cluster picking is named
[CLUSTER-PACK-3]{.title-ref} for easy identification. For this workflow,
the products are directly packed using their intended shipping boxes, so
`Package Use`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
`Reusable Box`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Create new package form.](cluster/cluster-package.png)
:::

## Create cluster batch

To create a cluster, navigate to `Inventory app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the operation type card,
`Delivery Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Pick`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (whichever is the first
operation in the delivery flow).

:::: note
::: title

:::

Click the checkbox to the left of the corresponding outgoing operation
to add them to the batch. With the desired pickings selected, click the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, and select the `Add to batch`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option from the resulting drop-down menu.

::: example
To create a cluster batch, as shown in the `example above
<inventory/misc/cluster_picking/example>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
in a warehouse configured with two-step outgoing shipments, the
following pick operations are selected:

- \`WH/PICK/00007\`: linked to `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} 88 for one apple and orange.
- \`WH/PICK/00008\`: linked to `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} 89 for one apple and banana.
- \`WH/PICK/00009\`: linked to `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} 90 for one apple, orange, and banana.

![Use \*Add to batch\* button, from the \*Action\* button\'s list.](cluster/select-picks.png)
:::

Doing so opens an `Add to batch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window, wherein the employee `Responsible`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for the picking can be assigned.

Choose from the two options in the `Add to`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field to either: add to `an existing
batch transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or create
`a new batch transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then, add a `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for this
batch.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field can be used
to add additional information to help workers identify the source of the
batch, where to place the batch, what shipping containers to use, etc.
::::

To create draft batch pickings to be confirmed at a later date, select
the `Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

Conclude the process by clicking `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Show \*Add to batch\* window to create a batch transfer.](cluster/add-to-batch-window.png)

## Process batches

To process batches, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Operations --> Batch Transfers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click on a batch to select it.

In the `Detailed Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
products that are to be picked are grouped by location.

Set the `Destination Package`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the
package dedicated to that particular order.

::: example
Process the cluster batch for the three orders of apples, oranges, and
bananas `example
<inventory/misc/cluster_picking/example>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
by assigning each picking to a dedicated package.

At the storage location for apples, [WH/Stock/Shelf A]{.title-ref},
assign the apples in all three pickings to one of the three reusable
packages, [CLUSTER-PACK-1]{.title-ref}, [CLUSTER-PACK-2]{.title-ref}, or
[CLUSTER-PACK-3]{.title-ref}.

Record this in Odoo using the `Destination Package`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field in the `Detailed
Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

# Wave transfers

While a batch transfer is a group of several pickings, a **wave
transfer** contains certain parts of different pickings. In Odoo, wave
transfers are batch transfers with an extra step: transfers are split
before being grouped in a batch.

Wave picking is ideal for warehouses that need to optimize the handling
of high order volumes while managing complex picking criteria. With wave
transfers, orders are grouped into waves based on factors like product
location, category, or scheduled shipping times. Each wave is assigned
to a different employee for the most efficient execution.

Wave picking is particularly useful for operations where multiple sales
orders (SOs), or a single order, must be picked across different waves.
This approach enables flexible scheduling, allowing warehouses to align
picking activities with shipping deadlines, or resource availability.

::: example
#\. `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 1 calls for one
apple and one orange #. `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} 2 calls for one apple and one banana #.
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 3 calls for one apple,
one orange, and two bananas

Apples are stored in Shelf A, oranges in Shelf B, and bananas in Shelf
C. A warehouse employee is assigned to the wave, and is provided with
the following instructions:

- Shelf A: Pick three apples. Place them into a central cart designated
  for the wave.
- Shelf B: Pick two oranges. Add them to the same cart.
- Shelf C: Pick three bananas. Add them to the cart.

The employee then takes the cart to the sorting/packing station. Items
are then sorted and packed into individual orders.
:::

## Configuration

To enable wave picking, begin by navigating to
`Inventory --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. In the
`Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, tick the
`Batch, Wave & Cluster
Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox to enable the
setting.

![View of Odoo Inventory app settings to enable the wave transfers option.](wave/wave-transfers-setting.png)

Next, the `Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options, under
the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading, must also be
checked on this settings page.

*Storage locations* allow products to be stored in specific locations
they can be picked from, while *multi-step routes* enable the picking
operation itself.

Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the
changes.

## Create a wave

Wave transfers can only contain product lines from transfers of the same
operation type. To view all the transfers and product lines in a
specific operation, navigate to the `Inventory app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Find the desired Kanban card, then click the
`fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(vertical ellipsis)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to open
the options menu. Under `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click
`Prepare Wave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![How to get an operation type\'s list of operations.](wave/list-of-operations.png)

### Create a new wave

On the `Prepare Wave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up, stock
moves lines are grouped by source location. Select the checkboxes for
the product lines that should be added. Then, click
`Add to Wave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Select lines to add to the wave.](wave/select-lines.png)

## Automatic waves {#inventory/shipping_receiving/auto-waves}

Waves can be automatically created and assigned based on different
criteria. The *Automatic Batches* option is defined on the *operation
type* level, which enables the creation of waves with distinct grouping
criteria for each operation type.

To enable *Automatic Batches*, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Operation Types`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select the
desired operation type (e.g. `Delivery`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Pick`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, etc). Under
the `Batch & Wave Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading,
tick the `Automatic Batches`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox.

Then, select one or more `Wave Grouping`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} criteria by ticking the appropriate checkbox. Even if
more than one grouping option is selected, only one wave is created.

Automatic waves can be created based on the following criteria:

- `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Split transfers by
  product, then group transfers that have the same product.
- `Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Split transfers
  by product category, then group transfers that have the same product
  category.

# Closest location removal

For the *Closest Location* removal strategy, products are picked based
on the alphanumeric order of storage location titles.

The goal of this strategy is to save the warehouse worker from taking a
long journey to a farther shelf when the product is also available at a
closer location.

::: seealso
`About removal strategies <../removal_strategies>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

::: {#inventory/warehouses_storage/sequence}
To understand *location sequence* in the closest removal strategy,
consider the following example:
:::

::: example
A product is stored in the following locations: [Shelf
A/Pallet]{.title-ref}, [Shelf A/Rack 1]{.title-ref}, and [Shelf A/Rack
2]{.title-ref}.

![Show a mockup of real storage location in a warehouse.](closest_location/locations.png){.align-center}

The sublocation, [Pallet]{.title-ref}, is on the ground level. Products
stored here are easier to retrieve, compared to requiring a forklift to
reach [Rack 1]{.title-ref} and [Rack 2]{.title-ref}. The storage
locations were strategically named in alphabetic order, based on ease of
access.
:::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To use this removal strategy, the `Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} settings **must** be enabled in
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

::: seealso
`Set up removal strategy <inventory/warehouses_storage/removal-config>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
:::

## Location names {#inventory/warehouses_storage/location-name}

To configure location names, begin by navigating to
`Inventory app --> Configuration
--> Locations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Then, select an
existing location, or click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
create a new one, and then enter the desired name in the
`Location Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Once the locations are named in alphabetical order, based on their
proximity to the output or packing location, set the removal strategy on
the `parent location
<inventory/location-hierarchy>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

To do that, in the `Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list,
select the parent location of the alphabetically named storage
locations.

Doing so opens the form for the parent location. In the
`Removal Strategy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select
`Closest Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: example
In a warehouse, the storage location [WH/Stock/Shelf 1]{.title-ref} is
located closest to the packing area, where products retrieved from
shelves are packed for shipment. The popular product, [iPhone
charger]{.title-ref} is stored in three locations, [WH/Stock/Shelf
1]{.title-ref}, [WH/Stock/Shelf 2]{.title-ref}, and [WH/Stock/Shelf
3]{.title-ref}.

To use closest location, set the removal strategy on the parent
location, \'WH/Stock\'.
:::

## Workflow

To see how the closest location removal strategy works, consider the
following example, featuring the popular product, [iPhone
charger]{.title-ref}, which is stored in [WH/Stock/Shelf 1]{.title-ref},
[WH/Stock/Shelf 2]{.title-ref}, and [WH/Stock/Shelf 3]{.title-ref}.

Fifteen, five, and thirty units are in stock at each respective
location.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To check the on-hand stock at each storage location, navigate to the
product form, and click the `On Hand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
smart button.

![Show on-hand stock at all locations.](closest_location/on-hand-stock.png){.align-center}
::::

Create a
`delivery order <inventory/delivery/one-step>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for eighteen units of the [iPhone charger]{.title-ref} by
navigating to the `Sales app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
and creating a new quotation.

After adding the products, clicking `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} creates a delivery order that reserves items stored at
the closest location, using the removal strategy.

For more details about *where* the units were picked, select the
`⦙≣ (bulleted list)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, located on
the far-right. Doing so opens the `Open: Stock move`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window that displays how the reserved items were
picked, according to the removal strategy.

In the `Open: Stock move`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, the `Pick from`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
displays where the quantities to fulfill the `Demand`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} are picked. All fifteen of the units stored at the
closest location, [WH/Stock/Shelf 1]{.title-ref}, are picked first. The
remaining three units are then selected from the second closest
location, [WH/Stock/Shelf 2]{.title-ref}.

# FEFO removal

The *First Expired, First Out* (FEFO) removal strategy targets products
for removal based on their assigned removal dates.

::: seealso
`About removal strategies <../removal_strategies>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Removal date {#inventory/warehouses_storage/removal-date}

Products **must** be removed from inventory before their *removal date*,
which is set as a certain number of days before the product\'s
*expiration date*.

The user sets this number of days by navigating to the product form\'s
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Under the
`Traceability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, ensure the
`Tracking`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set to either
`By Lots`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`By Unique Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Next, select the `Expiration Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option, which makes the `Removal Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field (and other date fields) appear.

:::: important
::: title

:::

The `Lots and Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Expiration Dates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} features **must**
be enabled in
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text

::::

The expiration date of a product is determined by adding the date the
product was received to the number of days specified in the
`Expiration Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field of the
product form.

The removal date takes this expiration date, and subtracts the number of
days specified in the `Removal Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field of the product form.

::: seealso
`Expiration dates <../../product_management/product_tracking/expiration_dates>`{.interpreted-text

In the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
product, [Egg]{.title-ref}, the following `Dates`{.interpreted-text

- `Expiration Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: [30]{.title-ref}
  days after receipt
- `Removal Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: [15]{.title-ref}
  days before expiration date

![Display expiration and removal dates set on the product form.](fefo/user-set-date.png){.align-center}

A shipment of Eggs arrive at the warehouse on January 1st. So, the
expiration date of the Eggs is **January 31st** (Jan 1st + 30). By
extension, the removal date is **January 16th** (Jan 31 -15).

`Sales app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and create a new
quotation.

Clicking `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} creates a delivery
order for today, December 29th, and the lot numbers with the soonest
expiration dates are reserved, using the
`FEFO (First Expired, First Out)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} removal
strategy.

To view the detailed pickings, click the
`⦙≣ (bulleted list)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, located on
the far-right of the Carton of egg\'s product line, in the
`Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the delivery
order. Doing so opens the `Open: Stock move`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

In the `Open: Stock move`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, the `Pick from`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
displays where the quantities to fulfill the `Demand`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} are picked from.

Since the order demanded six Cartons of eggs, using the
`FEFO (First Expired, First Out)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} removal
strategy, all five Cartons from [LOT1]{.title-ref}, with the removal
date of February 26th, are picked. The remaining Carton is selected from
[LOT2]{.title-ref}, which has a removal date of March 4th.

# FIFO removal

The *First In, First Out* (FIFO) removal strategy selects products with
the earliest arrival dates. This method is useful for companies selling
products that have short demand cycles, like clothes, for example. By
using `FIFO (First In, First Out)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
companies can prevent prolonged stock retention of specific styles.

::: seealso
`About removal strategies <../removal_strategies>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

::: example
Various quantities of the product, [T-shirt]{.title-ref}, tracked by lot
numbers, arrive on August 1st and August 25th. For an order made on
September 1st, the `FIFO (First In, First Out)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} removal strategy prioritizes lots that have been in stock
the longest. So, products received on August 1st are selected first for
picking.

## Arrival date {#inventory/warehouses_storage/arrival_date}

To see the product lot or serial number that arrived in inventory first,
navigate to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Then, select the `▶️ (right-pointing arrow)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon on the left of a product line, in order to reveal
a list of the product\'s lots or serial numbers that are in stock. The
`Created
On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field shows the lot/serial number
creation date, which is, essentially, the arrival date.

::: example
Serial number [00000000500]{.title-ref} of the product, [Cabinet with
Doors]{.title-ref}, arrived on December 29th, as displayed in the
`Created On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

## Workflow

To understand how `FIFO (First In, First Out)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} rotates products out, consider the following example,
focusing on three lots of white shirts.

The shirts are from the *All/Clothes* category, where
`FIFO (First In, First Out)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is set as
the `Force Removal Strategy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The white shirts are tracked `By Lots`{.interpreted-text

# Least packages removal

The *Least Packages* removal strategy fulfills an order by opening the
fewest number of packages, which is ideal for maintaining organized
stock without needing to open multiple boxes.

::: seealso
\- `About removal strategies <../removal_strategies>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} - [Odoo Tutorials: Least
Packages](https://www.odoo.com/slides/slide/5477/share)
:::

To understand how the removal strategy works, consider the following
example, featuring a warehouse that stores packages of flour in bulk
packages of [100 kg]{.title-ref}.

To minimize moisture, and/or prevent pests from entering open packages,
the least packages removal strategy is used to pick from a single,
opened package.

:::: {#inventory/warehouses_storage/pkg-qty}
::: example
A package of [100 kg]{.title-ref} of flour is depleted to [54
kg]{.title-ref} after fulfilling some orders. There are other packages
of [100 kg]{.title-ref} in stock.

1.  When an order for [14 kg]{.title-ref} of flour is placed, the
    package of [54 kg]{.title-ref} is selected.
2.  When an order for *more* than [54 kg]{.title-ref} of flour is
    placed, an unopened [100 kg]{.title-ref} package is used to fulfill
    the order. While this temporarily results in two open packages,
    these open packages are prioritized in the next picking.

In the `Open: Stock move`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, the `Pick from`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
displays where the quantities to fulfill the `Demand`{.interpreted-text

which exceeds the quantity in the opened package of [54 kg]{.title-ref},
an unopened package of [100 kg]{.title-ref} is selected.

# LIFO removal

The *Last In, First Out* (LIFO) removal strategy picks the **newest**
products on-hand, based on the date they entered a warehouse\'s stock.

Every time an order is placed for products using the
`LIFO (Last In, First Out)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} strategy, a
transfer is created for the lot/serial number that has most recently
entered the stock (the **last** lot/serial number that entered the
warehouse\'s inventory).

# Removal strategies

For companies with warehouses, *removal strategies* determine **which**
products are taken from the warehouse, and **when**. For example, for
perishable products, prioritizing the picking of goods with the nearest
expiration date helps minimize food spoilage.

The following columns in the table below list the removal strategies
available in Odoo, and detail how pickings are determined along with the
picking order. Leverage these removal strategies to have Odoo
automatically select how products are selected for orders:

                    `FIFO <removal_strategies/fifo>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}                              `LIFO <removal_strategies/lifo>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}                              `FEFO <removal_strategies/fefo>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}                             `Closest Location <removal_strategies/closest_location>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}      `Least Packages <removal_strategies/least_packages>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}

For comprehensive examples for how to use each removal strategy, refer
to each individual documentation page.

## Configuration {#inventory/warehouses_storage/removal-config}

Removal strategies are set on either the product category or storage
location.

![Change the Force Removal Strategy for either the Product Categories or Locations.](removal_strategies/navigate-location-category.png){.align-center}

Configure removal strategies on the location by going to
`Inventory --> Configuration
--> Locations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and selecting
the desired location. On the location form, choose a removal strategy
from the `Removal Strategy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field\'s
drop-down menu options.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To set a removal strategy on a location, the
`Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} settings **must**
be enabled in `Inventory -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

These features are **only** necessary when setting the removal strategy
on a location.
::::

Configure removal strategies on product categories by going to
`Inventory -->
Configuration --> Product Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and selecting the intended product category. Next,
choose a removal strategy from the
`Force Removal Strategy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down
menu options.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When there are different removal strategies applied on both the location
and product category for a product, the value set on the
`Force Removal Strategy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field set on
a `Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form is applied
as top priority.
::::

## Required features

While some removal strategies are available by default, some additional
features **must** be enabled in
`Inventory --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} for the removal strategy option to appear in the
drop-down menu of the `Force Removal Strategy`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Removal
Strategy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Refer to the table below for a summary of required features. Otherwise,
refer to the dedicated sections for the removal strategy for more
details on requirements and usage.

### Lots and serial numbers {#inventory/warehouses_storage/lots-setup}

Lots and serial numbers differentiate identical products and track
information like arrival or expiration dates. To enable this feature,
navigate to `Inventory --> Configuration
--> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Under the
`Traceability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading, check the box
beside `Lots &
Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to enable the
feature.

![Enable lots and serial numbers.](removal_strategies/enable-lots.png){.align-center}

Next, ensure the intended product is tracked by lots or serial numbers
by navigating to the product form through
`Inventory --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and selecting the desired product. On the product
form, switch to the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
and under the `Tracking`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
select either the `By Unique Serial Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `By
Lots`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options.

After enabling the features, assign lot or serial numbers to products
using an `inventory
adjustment <../warehouses_storage/inventory_management/count_products>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} or during `product
reception <inventory/product_management/assign-lots>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### Locations and routes

**Storage locations** and **multi-step routes** are necessary features
for setting **all** types of removal strategies on a location. However,
these features are specifically required for the closest location
removal strategy since it is only applied at the location level.

To activate these features, navigate to
`Inventory --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Under the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} heading, enable the
`Storage Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} features.

![Enable the locations and route features.](removal_strategies/enable-location.png){.align-center}

### Expiration date {#inventory/warehouses_storage/exp-setup}

Enable the **expiration date** feature to track expiration dates, best
before dates, removal dates, and alert dates on a lot or serial number
by navigating to `Inventory -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Under the `Traceability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading,
ensure the `Lots & Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
feature is selected, and then select the check box for
`Expiration Dates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to enable the
feature.

![Enable expiration dates feature for FEFO.](removal_strategies/enable-expiration.png){.align-center}

### Packages {#inventory/warehouses_storage/pack-setup}

The *packages* feature is used to group products together and is
required for the least packages removal strategy.

Navigate to `Inventory --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the check box for the
`Packages`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature.

instead of green.

Instead of revealing the reserved number of units for the order, the
`Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tooltip reads
`Available`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and reveals the
available number of units (e.g., [0 Units]{.title-ref}).

The `Forecasted Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} displays
forecast information about the product(s) included in the sales order;
namely, any live receipts of the product, and any active sales orders,
which are listed in the `Used By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column. See how each order is fulfilled in the
`Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

Additionally, the `Forecasted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
quantity is calculated at the top of the page, by adding the
`On Hand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Incoming`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} quantity, and subtracting
the `Outgoing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} quantity, as shown
below:

![Forecasted quantity equation from the Forecasted Report page.](at_confirmation/at-confirmation-forecasted-equation.png){.align-center}

If one order should be prioritized over another order, click the

role="menuselection"}. Then, select the desired
`Operation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to configure, or
create a new one by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In the `General`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, locate the
`Reservation Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and
select `Before scheduled date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When the `Type of Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
changed to `Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on an
`Operations Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form, reservation
methods are **not** available.
::::

Once selected, a new `Reserve before scheduled date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field appears below. From this field, the number of
`days before`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`days before when starred`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be
changed from the default [0]{.title-ref}.

Changing the `days before`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} value
changes the maximum number of days before a scheduled date that products
should be reserved.

Changing the `days before when starred`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} value changes the maximum number of days before a
scheduled date that products should be reserved if the transfers are
starred (favorited).

::: example
Here, the `days before`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} value is set
to [2]{.title-ref} days before, and the `days before
when starred`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} value is set to
[3]{.title-ref}.

This means products are reserved two days before the scheduled delivery
date for normal orders, and three days before the scheduled delivery
date for starred (favorited) transfers.

![Reserve before scheduled date field with set numerical values.](before_scheduled_date/before-scheduled-date-days-before.png){.align-center}

This is the configuration applied for the following workflow found
below.
:::

### Edit product form

Before the *Before scheduled date* reservation method can be used,
ensure that a *customer lead time* is added to products that plan to be
sold with this method.

To do that, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the desired product to configure.

On the product form, click the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and under the `Logistics`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, change the value in the
`Customer Lead Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

For this example workflow, change it to [5]{.title-ref} days.

This sets the scheduled delivery date for this specific product to five
days after the creation date of the sales order.

![Product form with customer lead time set in Inventory tab.](before_scheduled_date/before-scheduled-date-customer-lead-time.png){.align-center}

## Workflow

To see the *Before scheduled date* reservation method in action, create
a new `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by navigating to
`Sales app --> New`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Add a customer in the `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, then, in the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, click `Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
select a product from the drop-down menu that has a configured *customer
lead time*, to add to the quotation form.

Finally, in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column,
adjust the desired quantity of the product to sell.

For this sample workflow, set the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to [10]{.title-ref}.

Once ready, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
confirm the sales order.

Click the green `📈 (area graph)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon on the product line to reveal the product\'s
`Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tooltip. This tooltip
reveals the reserved number of units for this order. Because the
reservation method is set to *Before scheduled date*, the
`Reserved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} quantity reads [0
Units]{.title-ref}.

However, below that quantity reads [Available in stock]{.title-ref}.
This is because the quantity is available, but the scheduled date, for
this example workflow, is five days from the order date.

Since reservation is not until two days before the scheduled delivery,
it will not reserve the products until then.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If there is **not** sufficient quantity of stock for the product
included in the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
`📈 (area graph)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon is red,
instead of green.

Instead of revealing the reserved number of units for the order, the
`Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tooltip reads
`Reserved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and reveals the available
number of units (e.g., [0 Units]{.title-ref}).

Additionally, unless there is a set replenishment or a live receipt, it
also reads `No
future availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, in red text.
::::

![Confirmed sales order with product availability tooltip selected.](before_scheduled_date/before-scheduled-date-availability-tooltip.png){.align-center}

Click the `Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button to
see the delivery order form.

On the delivery order form, the status in the
`Product Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
listed as [Available]{.title-ref}, in yellow text, instead of green.
This is because there is sufficient stock on-hand for this order, but no
quantity has been reserved yet.

Note the `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
above the `Product Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, displays the date five days from the order creation date. This
indicates that the products are not reserved until three days from
today\'s date (two days before the scheduled delivery date).

![Delivery order form with product availability and reserved quantity.](before_scheduled_date/before-scheduled-date-delivery-order-form.png){.align-center}

In the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line, the numbers in the
`Demand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column and the
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column do not match (in
this case, the `Demand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column lists
[10.00]{.title-ref}, while the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column lists [0]{.title-ref}).

The `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column lists
[0]{.title-ref} because the products aren\'t reserved until two days
*before* their delivery date. Odoo automatically reserves the products
once the scheduled date arrives, at which point the
`Demand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns will match.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If the products in the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
should be reserved *sooner* than the scheduled reservation date, the
reservation can be manually overridden. To manually reserve the products
sooner than scheduled, click `Check Availability`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} at the top of the form.

This turns the [Available]{.title-ref} status in the
`Product Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field green,
and changes the number in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column to match the `Demand`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column.

Once ready, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Manual reservation

::: {#inventory/reservation_methods/manually}
:::

Unlike the *At Confirmation* reservation method, the *Manually*
reservation method does **not** reserve products automatically.

Instead, once a sales order (SO) is confirmed, product availability
**must** be checked manually, and the required quantity **must** be
reserved manually.

## Configuration

To set the reservation method to *Manually*, navigate to

`Operation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to be configured, or
create a new one by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In the `General`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, locate the
`Reservation Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and

## Workflow

To see the *Manually* reservation method in action, create a new
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by navigating to
`Sales app --> New`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Add a customer in the `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. Then, in the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, click `Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
select a product to add to the quotation from the drop-down menu.
Finally, in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column,
adjust the desired quantity of the product to sell.

Once ready, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
confirm the sales order.

Click the green `📈 (area graph)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon on the product line to reveal the product\'s
`Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tooltip. This tooltip
reveals the reserved number of units for this order. Because the
reservation method is set to *Manually*, the
`Reserved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} quantity reads [0
Units]{.title-ref}.

However, below that quantity reads [Available in stock]{.title-ref}.
This is because the quantity is available, but must be manually
reserved.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If there is **not** sufficient quantity of stock for the product
included in the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
`📈 (area graph)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon is red,
instead of green.

Instead of revealing the reserved number of units for the order, the
`Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tooltip reads
`Reserved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and reveals the available
number of units (e.g., [0 Units]{.title-ref}).

Additionally, unless there is a set replenishment or a live receipt, it
also reads `No
future availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, in red text.
::::

![Confirmed sales order with product availability tooltip selected.](manually/manually-availability-tooltip.png){.align-center}

Once the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is confirmed,
navigate to the `Inventory app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and locate the `Delivery Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} card
on the `Inventory Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.

The `Delivery Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} card displays
the current status of live orders, including those with a
`Waiting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status. Orders with this
status indicate that the products in those orders have either not been
reserved yet, or are not in stock at all.

![Delivery orders task card with waiting status orders.](manually/manually-delivery-orders-card.png){.align-center}

To see the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} created
previously, click the `(#) Waiting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button on the card (in this case, [8 Waiting]{.title-ref}).

Locate the delivery order (DO) tied to the
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that was previously
created, and click the line to view it.

On the `Delivery Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form, the
status in the `Product Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field is listed as [Available]{.title-ref}, in yellow text, instead of
green. This is because there is sufficient stock on hand for this order,
but no quantity has been reserved yet.

In the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, on the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line, the numbers in the
`Demand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column and the
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column do *not* match.

In this case, the `Demand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column
lists [10.00]{.title-ref}, while the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column lists [0]{.title-ref}.

![Delivery order form with product availability and reserved quantity.](manually/manually-delivery-order-form.png){.align-center}

To manually reserve the specified quantity of the product for this
order, click the `Check Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button at the top of the form. Doing so turns the
[Available]{.title-ref} status in the
`Product Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field green,
and changes the number in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column to match the `Demand`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column.

This is because there is sufficient quantity in stock to reserve for the
order.

Once ready, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Multiple orders with a *Waiting* status can be manually reserved at the
same time, and set to *Ready* status.

To do that, open the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
app, which reveals the `Inventory
Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page. The
`Inventory Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page is also
accessible by navigating to
`Inventory app --> Overview`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

From the `Inventory Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page,
click the `(#) Waiting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
`Delivery Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} card.

Then, tick the checkboxes to the left of each desired order, or tick the
checkbox in the header row, to the far-left, to select all orders on the
page at once.

Then, click the `Check Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button at the top of the page.

If the products included in every selected order have enough stock
on-hand, this reserves the products, and moves the order into
`Ready`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status. Upon receiving a
`Ready`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status, the order disappears
from the `Waiting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list.

If there is *not* enough stock on-hand, the order retains its current
status, and remains on the list.

# Reservation methods

Companies that sell and deliver goods to customers need to make sure
they always have stock on-hand, so when new sales orders are confirmed,
they can deliver products on time.

In Odoo, this can be handled using *reservation methods*. Reservation
methods control how products included in a delivery order (DO) should be
reserved for delivery, ensuring they are reserved at the correct times,
for the correct orders.

There are three different reservation methods in Odoo: *At
Confirmation*, *Manually*, and *Before scheduled date*.

:::::: tabs
::: tab
At Confirmation

Reserves products **only** when a sales order is confirmed, **and** if
stock is already available.
:::

::: tab
Manually

Once a quote is confirmed, product availability **must** be checked
manually, and the required quantity **must** be reserved manually.
:::

::: tab
Before scheduled date

A specific number of days can be selected; this is the maximum number of
days **before** a scheduled delivery date that products should be
reserved.
:::
::::::

## Configuration

Reservation methods are set on individual operations types. To configure
reservation methods, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Operations Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, select the desired operation type. Or,
create a new one by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In the `General`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the operation
type form, locate the `Reservation Method`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option, and choose which method should be used for this
type of operation.

![Reservation method field on delivery order operation type form.](reservation_methods/reservation-methods-operations-type-field.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If the `Before scheduled date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
reservation method is selected, a new
`Reserve before scheduled date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
appears below. From this field, the number of
`days before`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`days before when starred`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be
changed from the default [0]{.title-ref}.

Changing the `days before`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} value
changes the maximum number of days before a scheduled date that products
should be reserved.

Changing the `days before when starred`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} value changes the maximum number of days before a
scheduled date that starred (favorited) transfers for products should be
reserved.

![Reserve before scheduled date fields with before scheduled date method chosen.](reservation_methods/reservation-methods-before-scheduled-date.png){.align-center}
::::

## Required applications

The two required applications that **must** be
`installed <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to use
reservation methods are the *Sales* and *Inventory* apps.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In addition to delivery orders, reservation methods can also be used for
*manufacturing orders*, *resupply subcontractor* orders, orders for
*repairs*, and *internal transfers*, if desired. To enable this,
configure the additional settings:

- **For manufacturing orders:** Install the *Manufacturing* application
  by going to the `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
  application, locating the *Manufacturing* app, and clicking
  `Install`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- **For resupply subcontractor:** Navigate to
  `Manufacturing app --> Configuration
  --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and under the
  `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, enable
  `Subcontracting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, click
  `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- **For repairs:** Install the *Repairs* application by going to the
  `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} application, locating
  the *Repairs* app, and clicking `Install`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- **For internal transfers:** Navigate to
  `Inventory app --> Configuration -->
  Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and under the
  `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, enable
  `Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, click
  `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

Once these apps are installed, no additional features need to be enabled
from the settings for reservation methods to work. They will be
available by default on certain operations types, and can be viewed and
changed by navigating to `Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Operations Types`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and then
clicking on a specific operations type.

:::: note
::: title

# Bpost integration

Set up the *Bpost* shipping connector in Odoo to manage Bpost shipments
to clients directly within Odoo. To configure it, complete these steps:

1.  Create a Bpost account.
2.  Get the
    `Account ID and passphrase <inventory/shipping_receiving/bpost-account>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
3.  `Set up the shipping method in Odoo <inventory/shipping_receiving/bpost-method>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

Upon completion, it is possible to calculate the cost of shipping, based
on package size and weight, have the charges applied directly to a Bpost
business account, and automatically print Bpost tracking labels through
Odoo.

# How to cancel a shipping request to a shipper?

## Overview

Odoo can handle various delivery methods, including third party
shippers. Odoo will be linked with the transportation company tracking
system.

It will allow you to manage the transport company, the real prices and
the destination.

You can easily cancel the request made to the carrier system.

## How to cancel a shipping request?

- If the delivery order is not **Validated**, then the request hasn\'t
  been made. You can choose to cancel the delivery or to change the
  carrier.
- If you have clicked on **Validate**, the request has been made and you
  should have received the tracking number and the label. You can still
  cancel the request. Simply click on the **Cancel** button next to the
  **Carrier Tracking Ref**:

![image](cancel/cancel01.png){.align-center}

You will now see that the shipment has been cancelled.

![image](cancel/cancel02.png){.align-center}

You can now change the carrier if you wish.

## How to send a shipping request after cancelling one?

After cancelling the shipping request, you can change the carrier you
want to use. Confirm it by clicking on the **Send to shipper** button.
You will get a new tracking number and a new label.

# DHL integration

DHL is one of the shipping carriers for which a *shipping connector* is
available in Odoo\'s **Inventory** app. By enabling the shipping
connector in the app\'s settings, and configuring at least one *shipping
method*, the process of `calculating shipping rates
<../setup_configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
`generating shipping labels <labels>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} is
greatly simplified.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

While a variety of shipping connectors are available for different
carriers, this documentation details the configuration settings specific
to integrating DHL. For instructions on configuring the integration

## Enable DHL shipping connector

Before creating a DHL shipping method, enable the carrier\'s shipping
connector. To do so, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Scroll down to the `Shipping Connectors`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, and tick the checkbox next to
`DHL Express Connector`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Finally,
click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to apply the changes.

Then, click the `fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}

## Configure DHL shipping method

After enabling the shipping connector for DHL, shipping methods can be
configured for the carrier. Once configured, a shipping method can be
added as a line item to sales orders (SOs), which allows for automatic
computation of shipping rates, and generation of shipping labels.

To create a new DHL shipping method, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. In the
`Shipping Connectors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, select
the `DHL Shipping
Methods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} link below the
`DHL Express Connector`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

It is also possible to see existing shipping methods for every carrier,
by navigating to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Shipping Methods`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open a blank shipping
method form. If a shipping method has already been created, it can be
selected from this screen.

![The form for a DHL shipping method.](dhl_credentials/dhl-form.png)

### General information

Begin configuring the shipping method by entering its title in the
`Shipping Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

In the `Provider`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu,
select the `DHL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. After doing
so, a new `DHL Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
appears at the bottom of the form.

All other fields in this section are identical on the shipping method
forms for each shipping carrier. See the documentation on
`third-party shippers <third_party_shipper>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for instructions on how to properly configure them.

### DHL Configuration

The `DHL Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on the
shipping method form is used to connect the user\'s DHL account to Odoo,
and configure the shipping method\'s details.

#### DHL developer credentials

To integrate DHL with Odoo, developer credentials must be retrieved from
DHL\'s Developer Portal. These credentials are used to link the user\'s
DHL account to Odoo\'s **Inventory** app.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The *SiteID* and *Password* are different credentials than the ones used
to log in to a DHL account.
::::

##### With DHL Express Account

If a DHL Express account is available, log into the [DHL Developer
portal](https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/dhl-express-mydhl-api#get-started-section/user-guide%get-access)
and [request a DHL API account
number](https://developer.dhl.com/form/dhl-express-onboarding).

Then, in Odoo, on the shipping method form, enter the *DHL API Key* in
the `DHL SiteID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and the *API
Secret* in the `DHL Password`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

##### Without DHL Express Account

If a DHL Express account is **not** available:

1.  Begin by opening a [DHL Express
    account](https://mydhl.express.dhl/gb/en/ship/open-account.html#/fs-step=connectors&fs-step=connectors).

2.  Once the developer portal account has been confirmed, log in to the
    portal using the username and password. Click the user avatar in the
    top-right corner of the screen to open the user dashboard.

3.  On the dashboard, open the `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    tab, and create an app. Follow the four steps in the app creation
    flow (app name, needed apps, app status, confirmation) to complete
    the setup.

    ![Setup to create DHL account.](dhl_credentials/create-dhl-app.png)

4.  After setting up the DHL Express account, go
    [here](https://developer.dhl.com/user/login?destination=/form/dhl-express-onboarding)
    to get the *DHL API Key* and *API Secret* credentials.

Then, in Odoo, on the shipping method form, enter the *DHL API Key* in
the `DHL SiteID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and the *API
Secret* in the `DHL Password`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

#### Shipping details

The rest of the fields in the `DHL Configuration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab are used to configure the shipping method itself:

- `Region`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the region in which the
  shipping method is used.
- `DHL Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the shipping service
  purchased from DHL (e.g. Express Worldwide).
- `DHL Package Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the type of DHL
  package used for delivery (e.g. DHL Box).
- `Package Weight Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the unit of
  measure used to display package weight.
- `Package Dimension Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the unit
  of measure used to display package size.
- `Label Format`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the file format
  used to generate shipping labels.
- `Label Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the paper size
  used to print shipping labels.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Before selecting service options for a shipping method, make sure those
services are actually available for the DHL account. Available services
depend on the contract negotiated with DHL.
::::

#### Options

Additional settings are available in the `Options`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section at the bottom of the
`DHL Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:

- `Generate Return Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enable
  this option to automatically generate a return label after validating
  a delivery order.
- `Dutiable Material`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enable this
  option if the shipping method is liable to customs or other duties.

## Turn on the DHL Connection

Once the DHL connection is set up, use the smart buttons at the top of
the form to publish, turn on production mode or activate debug logging.

- `Unpublished`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}/`Published`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  determines if this shipping method is available on the user\'s
  **eCommerce** website.
- `Test Environment`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}/`Production Environment`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: determines whether label creation is for testing and
  cancelled immediately (Test) or generate real shipping label that is
  charged to DHL account (Production).
- `No Debug`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}/`Debug Requests`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  determines whether API requests and responses are logged in Odoo (turn
  on `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
  go to `Settings
  app --> Technical --> Logging`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}).

# Dispatch management system

The *dispatch management system* feature in Odoo is used to plan and
build shipments. Key features include:

- **Load building**: Group products for specific carriers, assign those
  `batches
  <../picking_methods/batch>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to loading
  docks, and manage vehicle assignments based on fleet capacity. This
  ensures the right products are packed into the appropriate trucks for
  delivery.
- `Fleet management <../../../../hr/fleet>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: Track and manage the capacity of in-house delivery
  vehicles.

## Configuration

To use the dispatch management system, the following setup must be
completed:

1.  `Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
    **Fleet** application.
2.  Configure vehicle `capacity (volume and weight)
    <inventory/shipping_receiving/vehicle-capacity>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
3.  Enter vehicle
    `car model(s) <../../../../hr/fleet/models>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}.
4.  Enable
    `necessary features <inventory/shipping_receiving/inventory-features>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} in the **Inventory** app.
5.  Set up `vehicles as delivery methods
    <inventory/shipping_receiving/delivery-method-for-carrier>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
6.  Create
    `dock locations <inventory/shipping_receiving/docks>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

### Vehicle capacity {#inventory/shipping_receiving/vehicle-capacity}

To configure the vehicle capacity, go to
`Fleet app --> Configuration -->
Categories`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Next, click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add a new
category, or click into an existing category to modify it. In the
`Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, enter the type of
vehicle (e.g., [Pick-up truck]{.title-ref}, [Van]{.title-ref}, or [Cargo
truck]{.title-ref}). Then, enter the vehicle capacity in the
`Max Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (in kilograms) and
`Max Volume`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (in cubic meters)
fields.

![Vehicle categories with defined weight and volume.](dispatch/categories.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The units of measurement for vehicle capacity are assigned at the global
level in the **Settings** app, in the
`Units of Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

![Show units of measure settings.](dispatch/settings.png)
::::

::: seealso
`Vehicle category <fleet/categories>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
:::

### Car model

Configuring a vehicle\'s car model is required when adding vehicles in
Odoo. Ensure the correct *Category* is selected for a car model. Doing
so automatically applies weight and volume capacities to all vehicles of
that type.

To configure, navigate to
`Fleet app --> Configuration --> Models`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

From the `Models`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list, select an
existing model, or click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
top-left corner to create a new model. Then, set the relevant
`Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to the relevant
vehicle category.

role="doc"}
:::

### Inventory settings {#inventory/shipping_receiving/inventory-features}

Next, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and enable the required features for dispatch
management.

In the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, tick the
`Batch, Wave & Cluster Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox to prepare batches of orders for delivery.

In the `Shipping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, tick the
`Delivery Methods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `Dispatch
Management System`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkboxes. Doing
so allows specific vehicles to be `set as carriers
<inventory/shipping_receiving/delivery-method-for-carrier>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

In the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, tick the
`Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox to
assign specific locations in the warehouse as loading zones for delivery
trucks.

Then, once all the configurations are complete, be sure to click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Delivery method {#inventory/shipping_receiving/delivery-method-for-carrier}

Next, assign each delivery vehicle as a *Carrier* by configuring a
delivery method.

To configure delivery methods, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Delivery
Methods`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Select an existing
delivery method, or click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
`Configure delivery method <../setup_configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

On the `Delivery Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form, enter
a name for the delivery method. It is recommended to use identifying
information, such as the vehicle description and license plate number
(e.g. [Truck 123-ABCD]{.title-ref}).

Since the delivery methods are managed internally, set the
`Provider`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to either
`Fixed Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Based on Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. For more
information about how shipping prices are calculated, refer to the
`Delivery method <../setup_configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
article.

Next, set a `Delivery Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which
is the product that shows up as the customer\'s
`delivery charge <inventory/shipping/sales-order>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} on the sales order or invoice.

Optionally, in the `Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, set the `Countries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`States`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Zip Prefixes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to limit the range of
local delivery.

![Example delivery method, with the `Zip Prefixes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} set to San Francisco\'s zip
code.](dispatch/delivery-method.png){alt="Delivery method form."}

### Dock locations {#inventory/shipping_receiving/docks}

Each loading dock must have a dedicated location. To create or configure
dock locations, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Click the desired location, which opens the `Location`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} form. In the `Additional
Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, tick the
`Is a Dock Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

![Location configuration page with
`Is a Dock Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox
ticked.](dispatch/dock-location.png){alt="Location configuration."}

## Build loads

Once setup is complete, `assign orders to a carrier
<inventory/shipping_receiving/assign-carrier>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `group them into batches
<inventory/shipping_receiving/create-batch>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Then, `configure the batch form
<inventory/shipping_receiving/batch-form>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, as needed.

To group products, go to the
`Inventory app --> Operations --> Deliveries`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, which reveals a list of outgoing deliveries.

![API Keys in Envia.com.](envia_shipping/envia-token.png)

## Setup in Odoo

`Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
`Envia Shipping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
([delivery_envia]{.title-ref}) module, and proceed to the following
sections to configure the integration in Odoo.

### Envia.com shipping connector configuration

After activating the Envia.com connector, create a delivery method by
going to
`Inventory --> Configuration --> Delivery Methods`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Fill out the following form fields:

- `Shipping Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Name of the
  shipping method, e.g. [Envia.com]{.title-ref}.
- `Provider`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
  `Envia`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu.
- `Delivery Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The product
  listed on the sales order as the delivery charge. A specific delivery
  product for Envia.com must be created.
- In the `Envia Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
  enter the `Envia Production Access Token`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- In the `Envia Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
  enter the `Envia Sandbox Access Token`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- `Insurance percentage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If
  insurance is needed, place a percentage of the value to insure. If
  not, leave it as 0. Keep in mind that the insurance price is
  calculated only after the label has been generated, including for LTL
  shipments.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

It is mandatory to fill both the production and sandbox tokens, but it
could be left as a random character as it is not validated at this
point.
::::

Additional considerations for the
`Envia Default Package`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:

- The package is specified in `mm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  and `kg`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The weight refers to the
  container itself, not its contents. Leave the weight as
  [0]{.title-ref} if no weight is reported, and set the max weight to
  [0]{.title-ref} if there is no specified limit.
- `Envia Package Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Set to
  `Box`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} by default. Ensure the
  correct type is selected, as it affects the available carriers and
  options displayed, which vary depending on this selection.

Once previous fields are properly set, navigate to the
`Envia Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and in the
`Envia.com Service Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, click
the `fa-refresh`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(refresh)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to sync the
carriers. In the pop-up window that appears, select a carrier and a
service level from the list.

![Envia.com carrier and services popup.](envia_shipping/envia-popup.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Envia keeps the main currency of the account fixed. In order to provide
more precise conversions for the costs of shipping, specify the currency
that is set for the account on Envia. If necessary, Odoo offers the
option to change the country. By default it uses the country associated
with the company.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If more than one shipping option is needed, create more shipping methods
in Odoo and modify any parameter like the package, carrier, or service.
::::

### Shipping information {#inventory/shipping_receiving/envia-shipping-info}

To use Envia.com to generate shipping labels, the following information
**must** be filled out accurately and completely in Odoo:

1.  **Customer information**: When creating a quotation, ensure the
    selected `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} has a valid
    phone number, email address, and shipping address.

    To verify, select the `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    field to open their contact page. Here, add their shipping address
    in the `Contact`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, along
    with their `Mobile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} number and
    `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} address.

2.  **Product weight**: Ensure all products in a delivery order have a
    specified `Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
    `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of their product
    form. Refer to the `Product weight section
    <inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-weight>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} of this article for detailed instructions.

3.  **Warehouse address**: By default all packages are sent from the
    specified address in the warehouse, make sure to set the address for
    correct label generation.

### Address filling guide

Each country has rules regarding how an address is filled. This is a
comprehensive guide of each country\'s expected fields exceptions:

  Country     Street              Street 2             City           State_id

role="guilabel"} field, commonly known as neighborhood. It is not always
mandatory, but when using the **EDI for Mexico (Advanced Features)**
module, the `Colony`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
required.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In Brazil the address is split to comply with regulation, so
[street_name]{.title-ref} is used for the street name only.
[street_number1]{.title-ref} is used for the street number and
[street_number2]{.title-ref} is used for the complement. This logic also
applies if the `Extended Addresses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
module is installed.

## Generate labels with Envia

When creating a quotation in Odoo, add shipping and the
`Envia.com shipping product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then,
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the delivery. Shipping
label documents are automatically generated in the chatter, which
include the following:

1.  `Shipping label(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} depending on
    the number of packages.
2.  `Return label(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if the
    Envia.com connector is configured for returns.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When labels are created, Envia.com automatically charges the configured
account and the final amount is logged in the chatter. If multi-currency
operations occur, the amount logged is calculated using Odoo\'s rate.
Actual rates may vary.
::::

Additionally, the tracking number is now available.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Brazilian Authorities might request the invoice related to the shipping
(NFe). It is recommended to physically attach the invoice of the order
along with the label.
::::

### International shipping

For international shipments it is required to fill both the
`HS code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the country of
`Origin of Goods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, both can be found
on the product\'s `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

### LTL shipments

LTL shipment labels can be generated through the Envia connector. The
insurance for LTL shipments is based on the *insurance percentage*
specified in the delivery method\'s form.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

For Mexico, since a *Bill of Landing* needs to be created for the
shipment, Odoo is required to send the UNSPSC code of the contents, as
well as a unit of measure for transportation which is **X8A - Pallet de
madera** by default.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Additional services are available when selecting [pallet]{.title-ref} as
a `Envia Package Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
delivery method, which allows selecting additional services like lift
assistance and deliveries during weekends.
::::

## Tracking and cancellation {#inventory/shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/cancel}

Shipments registered with Envia can be tracked using the
`Tracking`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button from the
delivery order or using the tracking link from the `customer portal
<../../../../general/users/portal>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

![Customer portal tracking.](envia_shipping/envia-customer-portal-tracking.png)

## FAQ

### Measuring volumetric weight

Many carriers have several measurements for weight. There is the actual
weight of the products in the parcel, and the volumetric weight.
Volumetric weight is the volume that a package occupies when in transit,
i.e. the physical size of a package.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Due to volumetric weight, it is possible that the actual weight in the
label is higher than the calculated value.
::::

### Which printing options are available?

On Envia.com in
`Settings --> Print options and Carriers printing options`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} for each of the carriers displayed, make sure to
use the appropriate format for the chosen carrier.

### The needed service is not available

For available carriers, make sure that they are enabled through Envia.

### Who will pay customs duties?

It\'s important to make sure that if there are exports to other
countries, use Envia\'s carrier settings to configure whether it is paid
by the sender or the receiver.

### What is \"Envia error\"?

It\'s a message that appears when there\'s an error in Envia. This
message mentions what went wrong in their platform so it can be
addressed.

# FedEx integration

Integrating a FedEx account with Odoo\'s **Inventory** app makes it
possible to `calculate
delivery rates <../setup_configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"},
and `generate delivery labels <labels>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
within Odoo. This is accomplished by enabling the FedEx *shipping
connector*, then configuring at least one *shipping method*.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This documentation contains configuration details specific to FedEx
integration. See the documentation on
`third-party shippers <third_party_shipper>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for general shipper integration instructions.
::::

## Enable shipping connector

To enable the shipping connector for FedEx, navigate to
`Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Scroll down to the `Shipping Connectors`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, and tick the checkbox next to
`FedEx Connector`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Finally, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the
changes. After doing so, a `oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `FedEx Shipping Methods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button appears below `FedEx Connector`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![The FedEx Shipping Methods button below the FedEx Connector.](fedex/fsm-button.png)

## Configure delivery method

Once the FedEx shipping connector is enabled, it is necessary to
configure at least one delivery method. After doing so, the delivery
method can be included in sales orders (SOs), and used to compute
delivery costs, and print delivery labels.

To enable a delivery method, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click the
`FedEx Shipping Methods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button below
the `FedEx
Connector`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox. Doing so opens a
page that shows all existing FedEx delivery methods.

:::: note

To see all delivery methods for every shipper with a connector enabled,
navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Delivery Methods`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

Select a delivery method to open its form. Alternatively, click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open a blank form, and
configure a new delivery method.

![The form for a FedEx delivery method.](fedex/fedex-form.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Enabling the FedEx shipping connector automatically creates two default
shipping methods: `FedEx US`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`FedEx International`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Each of these
methods are pre-configured with test credentials, allowing them to be
used for testing purposes.

Before the delivery method can be used to create actual shipments, the
test credentials must be replaced with credentials from a valid FedEx
account.
::::

### General information

At the very top of a delivery method form are fields used to configure
the way the method operates in Odoo. In the `Provider`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, select `FedEx`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu, if it is not already selected.

The rest of the fields in this section are general to all delivery
providers. For details on how to fill them out, see the documentation on
`third-party shippers <third_party_shipper>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

### Fedex Configuration tab

The options in the `Fedex Configuration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of a FedEx delivery method form are used to connect
the method to a FedEx account, and configure the delivery details
associated with the method (drop-off type, package type, etc.).

A FedEx developer account is required to obtain the information needed

The options that should be selected on the
`Fedex Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of a
delivery method depend on the negotiated delivery services of the
associated FedEx account. To confirm the available services for a FedEx
account, visit the *Account Management* page after logging in to the
FedEx website, or speak with a customer service representative.
::::

#### Options section

The `Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
`Fedex Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab provides a
few additional options to further configure the delivery method:

  menu to select whether duty charges should be paid by the
  `Sender`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Recipient`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Activate delivery method

By default, delivery methods in Odoo are created within a *test
environment*. This means they can only be used for testing purposes, and
are unable to generate actual delivery orders.

To activate a delivery method in a *production environment*, click the
`fa-stop`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Test Environment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at
the top of the delivery method form. After doing so, the smart buttons
changes to read `fa-play`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Production Environment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

With the production environment enabled, validating a delivery order
using the delivery method generates an actual delivery label with FedEx.

Click the `fa-play`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Production Environment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button
to return the delivery method to a test environment.

# Shipping cost invoicing

Invoicing customers for shipping after delivery ensures accurate charges
based on real-time shipping factors like distance, weight, and method.

In Odoo, shipping costs can be invoiced in two ways:

1.  Agree with the customer on a fixed cost and
    `include it in the sale order.
    <inventory/shipping/invoice-so>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
2.  `Invoice shipping costs to the customer post-delivery
    <inventory/shipping/invoice-shipping>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, reflecting the actual expenses incurred by the
    business.

## Configuration

To set prices to delivery methods, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Under the
`Shipping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, enable the
`Delivery Methods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature. Then,
click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Enable the \"Delivery Methods\" feature in Settings.](invoicing/enable-delivery.png){.align-center}

## Add shipping method

Next, configure the the price of each delivery method by going to
`Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Shipping Methods`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click the `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. Doing so opens a form to provide details about
the shipping provider, including:

- `Shipping Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (*required*) the
  name of the delivery method (e.g. [flat-rate shipping]{.title-ref},
  [same day delivery]{.title-ref}, etc.).

- `Provider`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (*required*): choose the
  delivery service, like FedEx, if using a third-party carrier Ensure
  the integration with the shipping carrier is properly installed and
  select the provider from the drop-down menu.

# Change shipping label size

## Overview

In Odoo, there are a variety of different types of shipping labels that
can be selected for delivery orders. Depending on the types of shipping
packages used, different label sizes may be more appropriate, and can be
configured to fit the package.

## Configuration

In the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} module, go to
`Configuration --> Delivery -->
Shipping Methods.`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} Click on a
delivery method to choose it. For the following example, *FedEx
International* will be used.

![Different shipping methods.](label_type/shipping-options.png){.align-center}

In the `Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, under
`Label Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, choose one of the label
types available. The availability varies depending on the carrier.

![Select a label type.](label_type/label-type-dropdown.png){.align-center}

When a sales order with the corresponding shipping company is confirmed
and a delivery order is validated, the shipping label will be
automatically created as a PDF and appear in the
`Chatter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Create a sales order

In the `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} application,
click `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select an
international customer. Click `Add A Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and select an item. Click
`Add Shipping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select a shipping
method, then click `Get Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
finally, click `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Add a shipping method and rate to a sales order.](label_type/shipping-rate.png){.align-center}

Once the quotation is confirmed by clicking `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, a `Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button will appear.

![Delivery order smart button.](label_type/shipping-italy-so.png){.align-center}

Once the delivery order is validated by clicking
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the delivery order, the
shipping documents appear in the `Chatter`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Shipping PDF documents.](label_type/shipping-pdfs.png){.align-center}

## Example labels

The default `Label Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
`Paper Letter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. An example of a FedEx
letter sized label is:

![Full page letter size FedEx shipping label.](label_type/full-page-fedex.png){.align-center}

For comparison, an example of a FedEx bottom-half label is:

# Print shipping labels

Integrate Odoo with `third-party shipping carriers
<../setup_configuration/third_party_shipper>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to automatically generate shipping labels that includes
prices, destination addresses, tracking numbers, and barcodes.

::: seealso
`Automatically print shipping carrier labels <inventory/shipping_receiving/carrier-labels>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
:::

## Configuration

To generate labels for a third-party shipping carrier, first
`install the third-party shipping
connector <../setup_configuration/third_party_shipper>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. Then, configure and activate the
`delivery method <inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-delivery-method>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, being sure to set the `Integration Level`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to `Get Rate and Create Shipment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to generate shipping labels. Finally, provide the
company\'s `source address
<inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-source-address>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `product weights
<inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-weight>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

::: seealso
`../setup_configuration/third_party_shipper`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

![Set the \"Get Rate and Create Shipment\" option.](labels/integration-level.png){.align-center}

### Labels for multi-step {#inventory/shipping_receiving/picking-config}

For companies using
`two <../daily_operations/receipts_delivery_two_steps>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} or `three step
delivery <../daily_operations/delivery_three_steps>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, labels can be triggered to print after validating the
picking or packing operation. To do that, go to `Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Operations Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and choose the desired operation.

On the `Operation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} configuration
page, tick the `Print Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox. Enabling this feature ensures that the third-party shipping
label is printed upon validating this operation.

::: example
For
`two-step delivery <../daily_operations/receipts_delivery_two_steps>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, where products are placed directly in packages during
picking, companies can print shipping labels during picking instead of
delivery. Odoo allows users to enable the
`Print Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature on the
[Pick]{.title-ref} operation itself to achieve this flexibility.

![Enable the \"Print Label\" feature.](labels/pick-print-label.png){.align-center}
:::

## Print tracking labels

Tracking labels are printed when specific operations are validated. By
default, validating a delivery order (DO) generates a tracking label in
the chatter.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

For companies using two or three step delivery, refer to the
`printing labels for multi-step
delivery <inventory/shipping_receiving/picking-config>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} section to learn how to print the label after validating a
picking or packing operation.
::::

When both the *Sales* and *Inventory* apps are installed, begin in the
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, and proceed to the
desired quotation or sales order (SO). There, and `add the shipping cost
<inventory/shipping_receiving/add-shipping-quote>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to the order. Then, navigate to the linked
`DO (Delivery Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} --- or another
operation type when using multi-step delivery --- to validate the
operation and print the label.

If only the *Inventory* app is installed, create
`DOs (Delivery Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} directly in the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app,
`add the third-party carrier
<inventory/shipping_receiving/validate-print-label>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} in the `Carrier`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
and validate the `DO (Delivery Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

### Add shipping on quotation {#inventory/shipping_receiving/add-shipping-quote}

To generate a tracking label for an order, begin by creating a quotation
in `Sales
app --> Orders --> Quotations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and filling out the
quotation form. Then, click the `Add Shipping`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the bottom-right corner of the quotation.

![Show the \"Add Shipping\" button on the quotation.](labels/add-shipping-button.png){.align-center}

In the resulting pop-up window, select the intended carrier from the
`Shipping Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu. The
`Total Order Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
automatically populated, based on the
`weight of products in the order <inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-weight>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Modify this field to overwrite the predicted weight, and
use this weight to estimate the cost of shipping.

Next, click `Get Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to display the
shipping cost for the customer, via the third-party carrier in the
`Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If clicking `Get Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} results in an
error, ensure the `warehouse's address
<inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-source-address>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `weight of products in the
order <inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-weight>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are properly configured.
::::

Click `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add the cost to the
quotation, which is listed as the `configured
delivery product <inventory/shipping_receiving/delivery-product>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Finally, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
on the quotation, and click the `Delivery`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button to access the
`DO (Delivery Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

# Multi-package shipments

In some cases, a delivery order with multiple items may need to be
shipped in more than one package. This may be necessary if the items are
too large to ship in a single package, or if certain items cannot be
packaged together. Shipping a single delivery order in multiple packages
provides flexibility for how each item is packaged, without the need to
create multiple delivery orders.

## Configuration

In order to split a delivery order across multiple packages, the
*Packages* setting must be enabled. To do so, navigate to
`Inventory --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then enable the checkbox next to
`Packages`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the change.

![The Packages setting on the Inventory app settings page.](multipack/packages-setting.png){.align-center}

## Ship items in multiple packages {#inventory/shipping/multiple-packages}

To split items in the same delivery order across multiple packages,
begin by navigating to `Inventory --> Delivery Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then select a delivery order that has multiple
items, a multiple quantity of the same item, or both.

On the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, select the
`⁞≣ (menu)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the line of the
product that will be shipped in the first package.

![The menu icon for a product in a delivery order.](multipack/product-menu-icon.png){.align-center}

This makes a `Detailed Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window appear. In the table at the bottom of the pop-up window,
the `Reserved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column shows the total
quantity of the product included in the delivery order.

If the full quantity will be shipped in the first package, enter the
number from the `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column in the
`Reserved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. If less than the
full quantity will be shipped in the first package, enter a smaller
number than the one that appears in the `Reserved`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column. Click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to confirm the `Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} quantities and close the pop-up.

![The Detailed Operations pop-up for a product in a delivery order.](multipack/detailed-operations.png){.align-center}

Repeat the same steps for every item quantity that is included in the
first package. Then, click `Put In Pack`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to create a package with all of the selected items.

![The Put In Pack button on a delivery order.](multipack/put-in-pack.png){.align-center}

For the next package, follow the same steps as detailed above, marking
the quantity of each item to be included in the package as
`Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} before clicking
`Put In Pack`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the delivery order.
Continue doing so until the full quantity of all items are added to a
package.

Finally, after all of the packages have been shipped, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm that the
delivery order has been completed.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

After one or more packages are created, a `Packages`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button appears in the top-right corner of the
delivery order. Click the `Packages`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
smart button to go to the `Packages`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
page for the delivery order, where each package can be selected to view
all of the items included in it.

![The Packages smart button on a delivery order.](multipack/packages-smart-button.png){.align-center}
::::

## Create a backorder for items to be shipped later {#inventory/shipping/backorders}

If some items will be shipped at a later date than others, there is no
need to put them in a package until they are ready to be shipped.
Instead, create a backorder for the items being shipped later.

Begin by shipping the items that will be shipped immediately. If they
will be shipped in multiple packages, follow the
`steps above <inventory/shipping/multiple-packages>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to package them as required. If they will be shipped in a
single package, simply mark in the `Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column the quantity of each item being shipped, but
**do not** click the `Put In Pack`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button.

After all quantities being shipped immediately are marked as
`Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click the
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and a
`Create Backorder?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears. Then, click the `Create Backorder`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. Doing so confirms the items being shipped
immediately and creates a new delivery order for the items that will be
shipped later.

![The Create Backorder? pop-up window.](multipack/backorder-pop-up.png){.align-center}

The backorder delivery order will be listed in the chatter of the
original delivery order in a message that reads
`The backorder WH/OUT/XXXXX has been created.`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Click on `WH/OUT/XXXXX`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the message to view the backorder delivery order.

![The backorder delivery order listed in the chatter of the original delivery order.](multipack/backorder-chatter.png){.align-center}

The backorder delivery order can also be accessed by navigating to
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, clicking the
`# Back Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
`Delivery Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} card, and selecting
the delivery order.

![The Back Orders button on the Delivery Orders card.](multipack/back-orders-button.png){.align-center}

Once the remaining items are ready to be shipped, navigate to the
backorder delivery order. The items can be shipped in a single package
by clicking `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and selecting
`Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
`Immediate Transfer?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
that appears, or shipped in multiple packages by following the steps
detailed in the section above.

It is also possible to ship out some of the items while creating another
backorder for the rest. To do so, simply follow the same steps used to
create the first backorder.

# Add a new delivery method

The *Delivery Methods* setting adds the option of calculating the cost
of shipping on sales orders and e-commerce shopping carts. The shipping
cost can then be added to a sales order as a delivery product, and the
shipping details can be added to the delivery order.

::: seealso
`../setup_configuration`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Configuration

To configure delivery methods, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Delivery
Methods`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the `Delivery Methods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is
not available from the `Configuration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu, verify whether the feature is enabled
by following these steps:

1.  Go to
    `Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
2.  Scroll to the `Shipping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section
    and enable the `Delivery Methods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    feature by checking the corresponding checkbox.

![The Delivery Methods feature enabled in the settings.](new_delivery_method/enable-delivery.png)
::::

::: {#inventory/shipping_receiving/delivery-product}
On the `Delivery Methods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, add a
method by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so
opens a form to provide details about the shipping provider, including:
:::

- `Delivery Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (*Required
  field*): the name of the delivery method (e.g. [flat-rate
  shipping]{.title-ref}, [same day delivery]{.title-ref}, etc.).
- `Website`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: configure shipping
  methods for an **eCommerce** page. Select the applicable website from
  the drop-down menu, or leave it blank to apply the method to all web
  pages. This field only appears when the **eCommerce** app is enabled.
- `Provider`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (*Required field*):
  choose the delivery service, like FedEx, if using a
  `third-party carrier <inventory/shipping/third_party>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}. Ensure the integration with the shipping carrier is
  properly installed and select the provider from the drop-down menu.
  For more details on configuring custom shipping methods, such as
  `fixed price
  <inventory/shipping/fixed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or
  `based on rules <inventory/shipping/rules>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} options, refer to their respective sections below.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the shipping method
  should apply to a specific company, select it from the drop-down menu.
  Leave the field blank to apply the method to all companies. This field
  only appears in multi-company databases.
- `Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the applicable
  routes to define different delivery methods, such as standard or
  express shipping, based on varying lead times. This field only appears
  when you have enabled multi-step routes in your inventory
  configuration settings. For more information, refer to the
  `Set routes on shipping method <inventory/shipping_receiving/shipping-route>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} section.
- `Delivery Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (*Required
  field*): the product listed on the `sales order line
  <inventory/shipping/sales-order>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} as the
  delivery charge.
- `Free if order amount is above`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  checking this box enables free shipping if the customer spends above
  the specified amount.
- `Tracking Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This option adds a
  link to the portal so the customer can track their delivery. When a
  custom carrier is added in a delivery order, the tracking button is
  enabled, and the link directs to the tracking portal with that URL.

::: example
To set up [\$200]{.title-ref} flate-rate shipping, fill in the following
fields:

- `Delivery Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: [Furniture
  Delivery (Manual)]{.title-ref}
- `Provider`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `Fixed Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Fixed Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: [200]{.title-ref}
- `Delivery Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `Furniture Delivery (manual)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

![Set up a delivery method with a fixed price of 200.](new_delivery_method/sample-delivery-method.png)
:::

::: {#inventory/shipping_receiving/availability}
Use the `Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to define
conditions for the delivery method based on the order\'s content or
destination:
:::

- `Countries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Specify one or more
  countries where the method is available.
- `Max Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Set a maximum weight;
  the method is only available for orders below this limit.
- `Max Volume`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Set a maximum volume;
  the method is only available for orders below this limit.
- `Must Have Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The method is
  available only if at least one product in the order has one of these
  tags.
- `Excluded Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The method is
  unavailable if at least one product in the order has one of these
  tags.

For examples on how to configure specific shipping methods, refer to the
sections below.

## Fixed price {#inventory/shipping/fixed}

To configure a shipping price that is the same for all orders, go to
`Inventory app
--> Configuration --> Delivery Methods`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and on the shipping method form, set the
`Provider`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the
`Fixed Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. Selecting this
option makes the `Fixed Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
become available, which is where the fixed rate shipping amount is
defined.

To enable free shipping if the amount of the order exceeds a specified
amount, check the box `Free if order amount is above`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and fill in the amount.

::: example
To set up [\$20]{.title-ref} flat-rate shipping that becomes free if the
customer spends over [\$100]{.title-ref}, fill in the following fields:

- `Delivery Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: [Flat-rate
  shipping]{.title-ref}
- `Provider`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `Fixed Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Fixed Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  [\$20.00]{.title-ref}
- `Free if order amount is above`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  [\$100.00]{.title-ref}
- `Delivery Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: [\[SHIP\]
  Flat]{.title-ref}

![Example of filling out a shipping method.](new_delivery_method/new-shipping-method.png)
:::

## Based on rules {#inventory/shipping/rules}

To calculate the price of shipping based on pricing rules, set the
`Provider`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to the
`Based on Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. Optionally,
adjust `Margin on Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Additional margin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to include
additional shipping costs.

### Create pricing rules

Navigate to the `Pricing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and
click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so opens
the `Create Pricing Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window,
where the `Condition`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} related to the
product weight, volume, price, or quantity is compared to a defined
amount to calculate the `Delivery Cost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Once finished, click either `Save & New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to add another rule, or
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: example
To charge customers \$20 in shipping for orders with five or fewer
products, set the `Condition`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
[Quantity \<= 5.00]{.title-ref}, and the
`Delivery Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
[\$20]{.title-ref}.

![Display window to add a pricing rule. Set a condition and delivery cost.](new_delivery_method/pricing-rule.png)
:::

To restrict shipping to specific destinations on the **eCommerce**
website, in the shipping method form, navigate to the
`Destination Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and
define the `Countries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`States`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Zip Prefixes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Leave these fields
empty if all locations apply.

### Calculate delivery cost

Shipping cost is the `Delivery cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
specified in the rule that satisfies the `Condition`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, plus any extra charges from the
`Margin on rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Additional margin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

$$Total = Rule's~Delivery~Cost + (Margin~on~rate \times Rule's~Delivery~Cost) + Additional~margin$$

::: example
With the two following rules set up:

1.  If the order contains five or fewer products, shipping is \$20
2.  If the order contains more than five products, shipping is \$50.

`Margin on Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is [10%]{.title-ref}
and `Additional margin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
[\$9.00]{.title-ref}.

![Show example of \"Based on rules\" shipping method with margins configured.](new_delivery_method/delivery-cost-example.png)

When the first rule is applied, the delivery cost is \$31 (20 + (0.1 \*
20) + 9). When the second rule is applied, the delivery cost is \$64
(50 + (0.1 \* 50) + 9).
:::

## Route on shipping method {#inventory/shipping_receiving/shipping-route}

Optionally, set different warehouse delivery processes for a shipping
method by configuring different
`routes <../daily_operations/use_routes>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
for it.

::: example
Configuring multiple routes per shipping method is helpful for adjusting
warehouse delivery processes based on:

- speed (e.g., use
  `one-step delivery <../daily_operations/receipts_delivery_one_step>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} for express shipping, or
  `two-step <../daily_operations/receipts_delivery_two_steps>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} for standard shipping).
- international shipping (e.g. use `three-step delivery
  <../daily_operations/delivery_three_steps>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} to prepare documents for customs)
- in-store pickup or home delivery: ship from the central warehouse, or
  pick from the store\'s stock, depending on customer selection.
:::

To set up routes, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Routes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
or select the desired route.

On the route form, in the `Applicable On`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, tick the `Shipping Methods`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox.

![Routes form with the `Shipping Method`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox
ticked.](new_delivery_method/shipping-route.png){alt="Routes form with the Shipping Methods checkbox selected."}

Then, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Delivery Methods`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the desired shipping method.

On the shipping method form, in the `Routes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, select the available fulfillment routes from the
drop-down menu.

:::: note
::: title

# Sendcloud integration

Sendcloud is a shipping service aggregator that facilitates the
integration of European shipping carriers with Odoo. Once integrated,
users can select shipping carriers on inventory operations in their Odoo
database.

## Setup in Sendcloud

### Create an account and activate carriers

To get started, [create or log in to a Sendcloud
account](https://account.sendcloud.com/signup/?utm_source=odoo&utm_medium=partnerships&utm_campaign=partner_integrations_page).

On the Sendcloud platform, follow the [Sendcloud integration
documentation](https://support.sendcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059470491-Odoo-Native-integration)
to configure the account and generate the connector credentials.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

For new account creation, Sendcloud will ask for a
`VAT (Value-Added Tax Identification)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
number or
`EORI (Economic Operators' Registration and Identification)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} number. After completing the account setup, activate (or
deactivate) the shipping carriers that will be used in the Odoo
database.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo integration of Sendcloud works on free Sendcloud plans *only* if a
bank account is linked, since Sendcloud won\'t ship for free. To use
shipping rules, or individual custom carrier contacts, a paid plan of
Sendcloud is **required**.
::::

### Warehouse configuration {#inventory/shipping_receiving/sendcloud-warehouse-config}

Once logged into the Sendcloud account, navigate to
`Settings --> Shipping -->
Addresses`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and fill in the
field for `Warehouse address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Adding addresses in the Sendcloud settings.](sendcloud_shipping/settings-shipping.png){.align-center}

To allow Sendcloud to process returns as well, a
`Return Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is required. Under
the `Miscellaneous section`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, there is
a field called `Address Name (optional)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The Odoo warehouse name should be entered here, and
the characters should be exactly the same.

::: example
| **SendClould configuration**
| `Miscellaneous`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
| `Address Name (optional)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  [Warehouse #1]{.title-ref}
| `Brand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: [Default]{.title-ref}

| **Odoo warehouse configuration**
| `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: [Warehouse
  #1]{.title-ref}
| `Short Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: [WH]{.title-ref}
| `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: [My company (San
  Francisco)]{.title-ref}
| `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: [My Company (San
  Francisco)]{.title-ref}

Notice how the inputs for the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, for both the Odoo configuration and the
Sendcloud configuration, are the exact same.
:::

### Generate Sendcloud credentials

In the Sendcloud account, navigate to
`Settings --> Integrations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} in
the menu on the right. Next, search for `Odoo Native`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, click on `Connect`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

After clicking on `Connect`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the page
redirects to the `Sendcloud API`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
settings page, where the `Public and Secret Keys`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} are produced. The next step is to name the
`Integration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The naming convention
is as follows: [Odoo CompanyName]{.title-ref}, with the user\'s company
name replacing [CompanyName]{.title-ref} (e.g. [Odoo
StealthyWood]{.title-ref}).

Then, check the box next to `Service Points`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and select the shipping services for this integration.
After saving, the `Public and Secret Keys`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} are generated.

![Configuring the Sendcloud integration and receiving the credentials.](sendcloud_shipping/public-secret-keys.png){.align-center}

## Setup in Odoo

To ensure seamless Sendcloud integration with Odoo, `install
<inventory/shipping_receiving/sendcloud-module>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `link
<inventory/shipping_receiving/link-sendcloud-module>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} the Sendcloud shipping connector to the Sendcloud account.
Then, `configure Odoo fields
<inventory/shipping_receiving/sendcloud-shipping-info>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, so Sendcloud can accurately pull shipping data to generate
labels.

::: seealso
`Enable pickup points on websites <inventory/shipping_receiving/sendcloud-pickups>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
:::

### Install Sendcloud shipping module {#inventory/shipping_receiving/sendcloud-module}

After the Sendcloud account is set up and configured, it\'s time to
configure the Odoo database. To get started, go to Odoo\'s
`Apps`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} module, search for the
[Sendcloud Shipping]{.title-ref} integration, and install it.

![Sendcloud Shipping module in the Odoo Apps module.](sendcloud_shipping/sendcloud-mod.png){.align-center}

### Sendcloud shipping connector configuration {#inventory/shipping_receiving/link-sendcloud-module}

Once installed, activate the `Sendcloud Shipping`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} module in `Inventory -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. The
`Sendcloud Connector`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting is
found under the `Shipping Connectors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section.

After activating the `Sendcloud Connector`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, click on the `Sendcloud Shipping
Methods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} link below the listed
connector. Once on the `Shipping Methods`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

`Shipping Methods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can also be
accessed by going to `Inventory -->
Configuration --> Delivery --> Shipping Methods`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

Fill out the following fields in the
`New Shipping Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form:

- `Shipping Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: type [Sendcloud
  DPD]{.title-ref}.
- `Provider`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Sendcloud`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down
  menu.
- `Delivery Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: set the product
  that was configured for this shipping method or create a new product.
- In the `SendCloud Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  tab, enter the `Sendcloud Public Key`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- In the `SendCloud Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  tab, enter the `Sendcloud Secret Key`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.

#### Pickup points {#inventory/shipping_receiving/sendcloud-pickups}

Sendcloud\'s [service point
delivery](https://support.sendcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026097951-FAQ-Service-Points)
lets customers choose a pickup location (such as a nearby shop or
locker) instead of entering a private delivery address.

To enable the feature, go to the shipping method form, and in the
`SendCloud
Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, under the
`Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, enable
`Use Sendcloud
Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Pickup point selection is only available through the **Website** app
(the online checkout view). It is not currently possible to select a
pickup point manually through the **Sales** app (the internal database
view).

For example, if the customer selects a shipping method like *Sendcloud
Mondial Relay*, they must choose a pickup point during the checkout
process on the website. If no pickup point is selected, the delivery
order cannot be validated in Odoo.
::::

#### Load shipping products

After configuring and saving the form, follow these steps to load the
shipping products:

- In the `SendCloud Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  tab of the `New Shipping Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  form, click on the
  `Load your SendCloud shipping products`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} link.
- Select the shipping products the company would like to use for
  deliveries and returns.
- Click `Select`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: example
Sample Sendcloud shipping products configured in Odoo:

| `DELIVERY`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

:::

![Example of shipping products configured in Odoo.](sendcloud_shipping/sendcloud-example.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Sendcloud does not provide test keys when a company tests the sending of
a package in Odoo. This means if a package is created, the configured
Sendcloud account will be charged, unless the associated package is
cancelled within 24 hours of creation.

Odoo has a built-in layer of protection against unwanted charges when
using test environments. Within a test environment, if a shipping method
is used to create labels, then those labels are immediately cancelled
after the creation --- this occurs automatically. The test and
production environment settings can be toggled back and forth from their
respective smart buttons.
::::

### Shipping information {#inventory/shipping_receiving/sendcloud-shipping-info}

To use Sendcloud to generate shipping labels, the following information
**must** be filled out accurately and completely in Odoo:

1.  **Customer information**: when creating a quotation, ensure the
    selected `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} has a valid
    phone number, email address, and shipping address.

    To verify, select the `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    field to open their contact page. Here, add their shipping address
    in the `Contact`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, along
    with their `Mobile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} number and
    `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} address.

2.  **Product weight**: ensure all products in an order have a specified
    `Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
    `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of their product
    form. Refer to the `Product weight section
    <inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-weight>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} of this article for detailed instructions.

3.  **Warehouse address**: ensure the warehouse name and address in Odoo
    match the `previously
    defined warehouse <inventory/shipping_receiving/sendcloud-warehouse-config>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} in the Sendcloud setup. For details on warehouse
    configuration in Odoo, refer to the `warehouse configuration
    section <inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-source-address>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} of the third-party shipping documentation.

## Generate labels with Sendcloud

When creating a quotation in Odoo, add shipping and a
`Sendcloud shipping product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then,
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the delivery. Shipping
label documents are automatically generated in the chatter, which
include the following:

1.  `Shipping label(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} depending on
    the number of packages.
2.  `Return label(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if the
    Sendcloud connector is configured for returns.
3.  `Customs document(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should the
    destination country require them.

Additionally, the tracking number is now available.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When return labels are created, Sendcloud automatically charges the
configured Sendcloud account.
::::

### Shipping rules

Optionally, create shipping rules to automatically generate shipping
labels tailored to different product needs. For example, a shipping rule
can be created for customers shipping expensive jewelry items to
purchase insurance.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Shipping rules do **not** affect `shipping rate calculations
<inventory/shipping_receiving/third-party-rate>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and are only used to improve the process of
`generating shipping labels <labels>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
::::

To use shipping rules, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Delivery:
Shipping Methods`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select
the intended [Sendcloud]{.title-ref} shipping method.

Under the `Sendcloud Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, in the `OPTIONS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, choose
the kind of shipments the shipping rules apply to, via the
`Use Sendcloud shipping rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

From here, choose either: `Shipping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to customers, `Returns`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from
customers, or `Both`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Use Shipping Rules field.](sendcloud_shipping/enable-shipping-rules.png){.align-center}

Then, in the Sendcloud website, navigate to
`Settings --> Shipping rules`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Create a new shipping rule by clicking `Create New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

In the `Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, set a
`Condition`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to determine when the
rule applies. Then, configure what to do when packages meet the
condition.

Sendcloud](https://support.sendcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/10274470454292-How-to-create-shipping-rules#examples-smart-shipping-rules)
:::

## FAQ

### Shipment is too heavy

If the shipment is too heavy for the Sendcloud service that is
configured, then the weight is split to simulate multiple packages.
Products will need to be put in different `Packages`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the
transfer and generate labels.

`Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can also be set up in
Sendcloud to use other shipping methods when the weight is too heavy.
However, note that these rules will not apply to the shipping price
calculation on the calculation on the sales order.

### Personal carrier contract

Use custom prices from a direct carrier contract, via CSV upload, by
first logging into Sendcloud, navigating to
`Settings --> Carriers --> My contracts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and then selecting the intended contract.

![Navigate to the contracts section in Sendcloud.](sendcloud_shipping/contracts.png){.align-center}

Under the `Contract prices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
click `Download CSV`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and fill out the
contract prices in the `price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column
of the CSV file template.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Ensure the CSV file includes the correct prices to avoid any
inaccuracies.
::::

![Show sample contract CSV from Sendcloud, highlighting the price column.](sendcloud_shipping/price-csv.png){.align-center}

`Upload`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the completed CSV file to
Sendcloud, then click `Save these prices`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
[Sendcloud: How to upload contract prices with
carriers](https://support.sendcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/5163547066004)
:::

### Measuring volumetric weight

Many carriers have several measures for weight. There is the actual
weight of the products in the parcel, and there is the *volumetric
weight* (`Volumetric weight is the volume that a package
occupies when in transit. In other words it is the physical size of a package`{.interpreted-text
role="dfn"}).

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Check to see if selected carrier(s) already have defined formulas to
compute the volumetric weight.

[Sendcloud: How to calculate & automate parcel volumetric
weight](https://support.sendcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059644051-How-to-calculate-automate-parcel-volumetric-weight)
:::

### Unable to calculate shipping rate

First, verify that the product being shipped has a weight that is
supported by the selected shipping method. If this is set, then verify
that the destination country (from the customer address) is supported by
the carrier. The country of origin (warehouse address) should also be
supported by the carrier.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Starshipit does not provide test keys when a company tests the sending
of a package in Odoo. This means that if a package is created, the
account may be charged.

Odoo has a built-in layer of protection against unwanted charges when
using test environments. Within a test environment, if a shipping method
is used to create labels, then those labels are immediately cancelled
after creation --- this occurs automatically. Please note that depending
on the shipping provider being used, the account might be charged for
printing label, unless the order is cancelled manually on the couriers's
portal.

Switch between the test and production environment by clicking the
`Environment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the top
of the shipping method form.
::::

### Generate a label with Starshipit {#inventory/shipping_receiving/star-label}

When creating a quotation in Odoo, add the Starshipit shipping method by
clicking the `Add
shipping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

In the `Add a shipping method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, select Starshipit in the `Shipping
Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Calculate the shipping rate by clicking `Get rate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Finally, click `Add`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to include the cost of shipping to the sales order
line, labeled as the *delivery product*.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Automatically calculate shipping costs for Starshipit in **both** Odoo
*Sales* and *eCommerce* applications.
::::

Then, `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the delivery.
Shipping label documents are automatically generated in the chatter,
which includes the following:

1.  `Shipping label(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} depending on
    the number of packages.
2.  `Tracking number(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if the
    selected courier supports it.
3.  `Return label(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if the
    Starshipit connector is configured for returns.

![Example of a shipped order in Odoo.](starshipit_shipping/starshipit-shipping.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Package weight in Odoo is calculated by adding the weights of the
products plus the empty package saved in the database. Ensure the
correct shipping option is selected, as the package weight is not
automatically verified.

Verify the destination address, as Starshipit checks it when the order
is created.

Finally, some couriers may require other information, such as an email
address or phone number. Please ensure that all necessary information
are set upon sending a shipping order.
::::

### Returns

Starshipit allows returns with the following couriers:

:   - Australia Post eParcel
    - TNT
    - Couriers Please
    - Aramex
    - StarTrack
    - DHL Express
    - NZ Post Domestic

This can be done by clicking the `Return`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button on the intended delivery order. If the
selected courier supports returns, the
`Print Return Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button will be
available.

### Cancellations

If a delivery order is cancelled in Odoo, it will be automatically
archived in Starshipit. However, the cancellation will not be sent to
the courier itself, so make sure to log onto the courier\'s platform to
handle the cancellation manually.

  field*): the name of the delivery method (e.g. [FedEx US]{.title-ref},
  [FedEx EU]{.title-ref}, etc.).

- `Website`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: configure shipping
  methods for an *eCommerce* page that is connected to a specific
  website in the database. Select the applicable website from the
  drop-down menu, or leave it blank to apply the method to all web
  pages.

- `Provider`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (*Required field*):
  choose the third-party delivery service, like FedEx. Upon choosing a
  provider, the `Integration Level`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Insurance Percentage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields
  become available.

- `Integration Level`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: choose
  `Get Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to simply get an
  `estimated

:::

### Production environment {#inventory/shipping_receiving/production-env}

With the delivery method details configured, click the
`Test Environment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button to
set it to `Production Environment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Setting the delivery method to `Production`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} creates **real** shipping labels, and users are at risk
of being charged through their carrier account (e.g. UPS, FedEx, etc.)
**before** users charge customers for shipping. Verify all
configurations are correct before launching the delivery method to
`Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

![Show the \"Test Environment\" smart button.](third_party_shipper/production.png){.align-center}

### Warehouse configuration {#inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-source-address}

Ensure the warehouse\'s `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
(including ZIP code) and `Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
number are entered accurately. To do that, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Warehouses`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select the
desired warehouse.

On the warehouse configuration page, open the warehouse contact page by
clicking the `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

## Apply third-party shipping carrier {#inventory/shipping_receiving/apply-third-party-carrier}

Shipping carriers can be applied on a
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, invoice, or delivery
order.

After configuring the third-party carrier\'s `delivery method
<inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-delivery-method>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} in Odoo, create or navigate to a quotation by going to
`Sales app --> Orders --> Quotations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

### Sales order {#inventory/shipping_receiving/third-party-so}

To assign a third-party shipping carrier, and get an estimated cost of
shipping, begin by going to
`Sales app --> Orders --> Quotations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Create or select an existing quotation, and add
the cost of shipping through a third-party carrier to a quotation, by
clicking the `Add Shipping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in
the bottom-right corner of the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.

![Show the \"Add shipping\" button at the bottom of a quotation.](third_party_shipper/add-shipping.png){.align-center}

In the resulting `Add a shipping method`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window, select the intended carrier from the
`Shipping Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu. The
`Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is automatically filled
based on:

- the amount specified in the `Total Order Weight`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field (if it is not provided, the sum of
  `product weights <inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-weight>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} in the order is used)
- the distance between the warehouse\'s `source address
  <inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-source-address>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} and the customer\'s address.

::: {#inventory/shipping_receiving/third-party-rate}
After selecting a third-party provider in the
`Shipping Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, click
`Get Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Add a shipping method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
to get the estimated cost through the shipping connector. Then, click
the `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to add the delivery
charge to the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
invoice.

### Delivery order {#inventory/shipping_receiving/third-party-do}

For users making shipments without installing the *Sales* app, assign
the shipping carrier to the delivery order, by first going to the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app. Then, from the
`Inventory Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard,
select the `Delivery Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
operation type, and choose the desired delivery order that is not
already marked as `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Cancelled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In the `Additional info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, set the
`Carrier`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to the desired
third-party shipping carrier. When the delivery method is set to
`production mode
<inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-delivery-method>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, a `Tracking Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
is provided.

## Troubleshooting {#inventory/shipping_receiving/third-party-troubles}

Since shipping connectors can sometimes be complex to set up, here are
some checks to try when things are not working as expected:

1.  Ensure the
    `warehouse information <inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-source-address>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} (e.g., address and phone number) in Odoo is correct
    **and** matches the records saved in the shipping provider\'s
    website.

2.  Verify that the
    `package type <inventory/warehouses_storage/package-type>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and parameters are valid for the shipping carrier. To
    check, ensure the shipment can be directly created on the shipping
    carrier\'s website.

3.  When encountering a price mismatch between Odoo\'s estimated cost
    and the provider\'s charge, first ensure the delivery method is set
    to `production environment
    <inventory/shipping_receiving/production-env>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

    Then, create the shipment in both the carrier\'s website and Odoo,
    and verify the prices are the same across Odoo, the shipping
    provider, and in the *debug logs*.

    ::: example
    When checking for a price mismatch in the debug logs, if the request
    says the package weighs six kilograms, but the response from FedEx
    says the package weights seven kilograms, it concludes that the
    issue is on FedEx\'s side.
    :::

### Debug log

Track shipping data inconsistencies by activating debug logging. To do
that, go to the delivery method\'s configuration page
(`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Shipping
Method`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}), and select the desired
shipping method. Click the `No Debugging`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button to activate
`Debug Requests`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Show the \"No Debug\" smart button.](third_party_shipper/no-debug.png){.align-center}

With `Debug Requests`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} activated, each
time the shipping connector is used to estimate the cost of shipping,
records are saved in the `Logging`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
report. To access the report, turn on
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and go
to `Settings app --> Technical -->
Database Structure section --> Logging`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

:::: note
::: title

:::

Logs are created for a shipping method each time the `Get Rate
<inventory/shipping_receiving/third-party-rate>`{.interpreted-text

carrier to their order through the *Website* app.
::::

![Show how to find the \"Logging\" option from the \"Technical\" menu.](third_party_shipper/log.png){.align-center}

# Zebra label configuration

In Odoo, labels printed in the Zebra Programming Language (ZPL) file
format are designed to fit a four-by-six inch label. To resize (or
reformat) text to fit a variety of
`ZPL (Zebra Programming Language)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} label
sizes,
`navigate to the ZPL label view <inventory/shipping_receiving/zpl-view>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and alter the
`ZPL (Zebra Programming Language)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} code.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

When customizing code in Odoo, please note that upgrading the database
to newer versions may break custom
`ZPL (Zebra Programming Language)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} code.
**Customers are responsible for maintaining their custom code**.
::::

Refer to the following sections for explanations, and example code, for
frequently requested Zebra label customizations.

- `Adjust margins <inventory/shipping_receiving/margin>`{.interpreted-text

## Adjust margin {#inventory/shipping_receiving/margin}

Text gets cut off from standard
`ZPL (Zebra Programming Language)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} labels
printed in Odoo when the line exceeds fifty-five characters. To fit long
product names, or lot numbers, on a single line, adjust the margin.

To begin, navigate to the
`ZPL code of the label <inventory/shipping_receiving/zpl-view>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} in the `Architecture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab. In the `ZPL (Zebra Programming Language)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} code for product labels, look for the [\^FT]{.title-ref}
command, which specifies where to start placing the text, or graphic
element, on the label. The two numbers immediately following
[\^FT]{.title-ref} define the x-coordinate and y-coordinate in dots
(`similar to
pixels for printers`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}) from the left and
top margins.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When customizing lot/serial number labels, look for the
[\^FO]{.title-ref} command, instead of [\^FT]{.title-ref}.
::::

::: example
The following is an example where the product\'s name gets cut off with
Odoo\'s default `ZPL (Zebra Programming Language)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} formatting. In the **Fixed** tab, the x-coordinate of the
starting position of the label is changed from [\^FT100,80]{.title-ref}
to [\^FT0,80]{.title-ref}, to fit the entire name.

## Resize barcode {#inventory/shipping_receiving/resize}

To adjust the size of the barcode to scale, begin by navigating to the
`ZPL code of the label
<inventory/shipping_receiving/zpl-view>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
in the `Architecture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Look for
the [\^FO]{.title-ref} command (typically in the third line), which is
the starting point of the margin for the barcode.

The [\^BY]{.title-ref} command configures barcode size, and takes three
numbers: bar width, width of wide bars relative to narrow bars, and bar
height. By default, `ZPL (Zebra Programming Language)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} code in Odoo uses [\^BY3]{.title-ref}, setting the bar
width to three dots, a typical size that is easy for barcode scanners to
read.

::: example
To shrink the barcode to scale, [\^BY3]{.title-ref} is reduced to
[\^BY2]{.title-ref}.

## Rotate elements {#inventory/shipping_receiving/rotate}

To rotate elements in
`ZPL (Zebra Programming Language)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, begin
by navigating to the `ZPL code of the label
<inventory/shipping_receiving/zpl-view>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
in the `Architecture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

The [\^BC]{.title-ref} command\'s first parameter
(`information that affects the behavior of the command`{.interpreted-text
role="dfn"}) defines the rotation of an item, which can be:

- \`N\`: display normally
- \`R\`: rotate 90 degrees
- \`I\`: rotate 180 degrees
- \`B\`: rotate 270 degrees

# Delivery methods

In Odoo, *delivery methods* make it possible to calculate shipping costs
directly on sales orders and e-commerce carts, providing customers and
sales teams with accurate shipping fee information. This transparency
helps close sales by showing customers the exact cost for each shipping
carrier or delivery timeframe.

When activated in Odoo, the *Delivery Methods* setting adds the option
of calculating the cost of shipping on sales orders and e-commerce
shopping carts.

When integrated with a
`third-party carrier <inventory/shipping/third_party>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, shipping prices are calculated based on the carrier\'s
pricing information.

::: seealso
\-
`Third-party shipping carrier setup <inventory/shipping/third_party>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} - [Odoo Tutorials: Delivery
Prices](https://www.odoo.com/slides/slide/delivery-prices-613?fullscreen=1)
:::

## Configuration

To calculate shipping on sales orders and e-commerce, the **Delivery
Costs** module must be installed. To do so, navigate to the
`Apps`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} application from the main
Odoo dashboard.

Then, remove the `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter, and
type in [Delivery Costs]{.title-ref} in the search bar. After finding
the `Delivery Costs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} module, click
`Install`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to install it.

![Install the Delivery Costs module.](setup_configuration/install-module.png)

## Add shipping {#inventory/shipping/sales-order}

Shipping methods are added to sales orders in the form of delivery
products, which appear as individual line items. First, navigate to the
desired sales order by going to `Sales
app --> Orders --> Orders`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Open the desired sales order, then click the
`Add shipping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. The `Add a
shipping method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window opens.
Then, using the drop-down menu, select an available shipping method.

The `Total Order Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
pre-filled based on product weights (that are defined in the
`Inventory <inventory/product_management/manufacture>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} tab for each product form). Edit the field to specify the
exact weight, and then click `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
add the shipping method.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The amount defined in `Total Order Weight`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} overwrites the total product weights defined on the
product form.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Some connected shipping methods require obtaining rates from the
carrier. In this situation, click the `oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Get rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and
the shipping costs are automatically updated from the carrier. These
rates cannot be modified.
::::

The shipping cost is added as a line item in the
`Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab as the
`Delivery Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} detailed on the
shipping method form.

::: example
A customer purchased a left-sided desk with storage and requested the
item be delivered by hand. This delivery method is defined as [Furniture
Delivery (Manual)]{.title-ref} and has a cost of [\$200]{.title-ref}.
The sales order contains two line items: one for the desk, and another
for the delivery method.

![Show delivery order on the sales order line.](setup_configuration/delivery-product.png)
:::

### Delivery order

The shipping method added to the sales order is linked to the shipping
carrier details on the delivery order. After confirming the order, a
`fa-truck`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Delivery`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button appears at the top of the page. Click the
`fa-truck`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Delivery`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button to open the warehouse delivery form. To
add or change the delivery method on the delivery itself, open the
`Additional Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and modify the
`Carrier`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

# Inventory adjustments

In any warehouse management system, the recorded inventory counts in the
database might not always match the actual inventory counts in the
warehouse. Discrepancy between counts can be due to damage, human error,
theft, or other factors. As such, inventory adjustments must be made to
reconcile the differences, and ensure that the recorded counts in the
database match the actual counts in the warehouse.

## Inventory Adjustments page

To view the `Inventory Adjustments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
page, navigate to `Inventory app -->
Operations --> Physical Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![In stock products listed on the Inventory adjustments page.](count_products/inventory-adjustments-page.png)

The `Inventory Adjustments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page
lists all products that are currently in stock.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Only products with a quantity greater than zero are listed on the
`Inventory
Adjustments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page. To view product
lines with zero current quantity, go to
`Inventory app --> Reporting --> Stock`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

For each product line, the following information is listed:

- `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the specific location
  in the warehouse where a product is stored. This column is **only**
  visible if `Storage Locations <use_locations>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} are enabled.
- `Favorite`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: identifies products
  that have been favorited.
- `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the product whose
  quantity is listed on the inventory adjustment line.
- `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the tracking
  identifier assigned to the specific product listed. It can contain
  letters, numbers, or a combination of both.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If a specific product has a quantity of more than [1.00]{.title-ref} in
stock, and more than one serial number, or lot number, assigned to it,
each uniquely-identified product is displayed on its own product line
with its own lot/serial number, displayed under the
`Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.
::::

- `Expiration Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date on
  which the goods with this serial number are due to expire.
- `Last Count Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the last time
  the quantity was updated.
- `Package`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the package containing
  the quantity listed.
- `On Hand Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the quantity of
  the product currently recorded in the database.
- `Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the *unit of measure* in
  which the product is measured. Unless otherwise specified (e.g., in
  `Pounds`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Ounces`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), the default
  `UoM (Unit of
  Measure)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is `Units`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- `Counted Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the real
  quantity counted during an inventory count. This field is left blank
  by default but can be changed, depending on if it matches the `On Hand
  Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or not.
- `Difference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the difference
  between the `On Hand Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Counted Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, once an
  inventory adjustment is made. The difference is automatically
  calculated after every inventory adjustment.
- `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date at which
  a count should be made. If not otherwise specified, this date will
  default to the 31st of December of the current year.
- `User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the person assigned to the
  count in the database. This can either be the person physically
  counting the inventory, or applying the count in the database.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Additional columns are hidden by default. To reveal these columns, click
the `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(adjust)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the far right of
the form\'s top row, and reveal any desired column by ticking the
checkbox next to that option.
::::

### Create an inventory adjustment {#inventory/create-adjustment}

To create a new inventory adjustment from the
`Inventory Adjustments`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} page,
click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so creates a new,
blank inventory adjustment line at the bottom of the page.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

inventory adjustments can also be created from the
`Forecasted Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on an individual
product record. To open the report, navigate to a product record and
click the `Forecasted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button.
Then, at the top of the page, click `Update
Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Update Quantities button on a Forecast report in the Inventory app.](count_products/forecast-report.png)
::::

On this blank inventory adjustment line, click the drop-down menu under
the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, and select a
product. If the selected product is tracked using either lots or serial
numbers, the desired lot or serial number needs to be chosen from the
drop-down menu under the `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The inventory adjustment line can also be used to create or record lots
and serial numbers.
::::

Next, set the value in the `Counted Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column to the quantity counted for that product during
the inventory adjustment process.

To the right of the `Counted Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column, the `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can also
be changed via their respective drop-down menus. Changing the
`Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} changes the date
that the inventory adjustment should be processed on, and selecting a
responsible `User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} assigns a user to
the specific inventory adjustment for traceability purposes.

Once all changes have been made to the new inventory adjustment line,
click away from the line. Doing so saves the adjustment, and moves the
line to the top of the page.

If the `Counted Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is greater
than the `On Hand Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
value in the `Difference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column is
**green**. If the `Counted Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
is less than the `On Hand Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
the value in the `Difference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column
is **red**. If the quantities match, and have not been changed at all,
no value appears in the `Difference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column.

![Difference column on inventory adjustments page.](count_products/difference-column.png)

At this stage, the count (`inventory adjustment`{.interpreted-text
role="dfn"}) is recorded, but not yet applied. This means that the
quantity on hand before the adjustment has not yet been updated to match
the new, real counted quantity.

### Apply adjusted count {#inventory/apply-adjustment}

inventory adjustments can be completed in several ways. The first way is
to click the `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
line at the far right of the page. The second way is to tick the
checkbox on the far left of the line. Doing so reveals new button
options at the top of the page, one of which is an
`Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. Clicking this button
instead causes an `Inventory Adjustment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window to appear.

From this pop-up menu, a reference or reason can be assigned to the
inventory adjustment. By default, the
`Inventory Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
pre-populated with today\'s date, the date the adjustment is being made
on, but can be changed to reflect whatever reference or reason is
desired.

Once ready, click `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to apply
the inventory adjustment.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Applying an inventory adjustment simultaneously creates a
`stock move line (SML)
<../reporting/moves_history>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} in the
*Moves History* report for traceability.
::::

![Apply all option applies the inventory adjustment once a reason is specified.](count_products/apply-inventory-adjustment.png)

## Relocate products

inventory adjustments can also be used to relocate products to different
storage locations, or to different packages. To relocate a product, tick
the checkbox at the far left of the line for the desired product. At the
top of the page, click the `Relocate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button. Doing so opens a pop-up.

![The Relocate products pop-up on the Inventory Adjustments page.](count_products/relocate-popup.png)

On the resulting pop-up, enter the following information:

- `To Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the new location for
  the products.
- `To Package`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the new package for
  the products.
- `Reason for relocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the reason
  for the move.

Product relocations **only** work on internal locations. Products
**cannot** be moved between companies.

Only users with *Administrator* rights can perform product relocations.
::::

## Set to zero

inventory adjustments can also be used to clear inventory counts by
setting the quantity to zero. To do this, tick the checkbox at the far
left of the line for the desired product. At the top of the page, click
the `fa-gear`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to open a drop-down menu. Click
`Set to 0`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Once this is complete,
`apply <inventory/apply-adjustment>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
adjusted count.

## Count products

Counting products is a recurring activity in a warehouse. Once a count
is complete, go to
`Inventory app --> Operations --> Physical Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to update the `Counted Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column for each product line.

On each product line, identify whether the value in the
`On Hand Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column recorded in
the database matches the newly-counted value. If the recorded value and
the counted value do match, click the `fa-bullseye`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Set`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon at the far
right of the product line.

Doing so copies the value from the `On Hand Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column over to the `Counted Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column, and sets the value of the
`Difference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column to
[0.00]{.title-ref}. Subsequently, once applied, an inventory move with
[0.00]{.title-ref} `Quantity Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
recorded in the product\'s inventory adjustment history.

![Zero count inventory adjustment move.](count_products/zero-move.png)

If the newly-counted value for a given product does **not** match the
value in the `On
Hand Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} recorded in the
database, instead of clicking the `fa-bullseye`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Set`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, record the
real value in the field in the `Counted Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column.

To do so, click the field in the `Counted Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column on the specific inventory adjustment line for
the product whose count is being changed. This automatically assigns a
`Counted Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of
[0.00]{.title-ref}.

To change this value, type in a new value that matches the real,
newly-counted value. Then, click away from the line. Doing so saves the
adjustment, and automatically adjusts the value in the
`Difference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

If the `Counted Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is greater
than the `On Hand Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
value in the `Difference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column is
**green**. If the `Counted Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
is less than the `On Hand Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
the value in the `Difference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column
is **red**. If the quantities match, and have not been changed at all,
no value appears in the `Difference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column.

Subsequently, once applied, a move with the difference between the
`On Hand Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
`Counted Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is recorded in the
product\'s inventory adjustment history.

![Inventory Adjustments History dashboard detailing a list of prior product moves.](count_products/history-inventory-adjustments.png)

The `Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu appears when one
or more products\' checkboxes are selected. The
`Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu includes the option to
`Set to quantity on hand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which sets
the selected products\' `Counted Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to the `On Hand Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `Set to 0`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
which sets the selected products\' `Counted Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to zero.

![Inventory Adjustments Actions menu.](count_products/inventory-adjustment-actions.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Sometimes a count occurs, but cannot be applied in the database right
away. In the time between the actual count and applying the inventory
adjustment, product moves can occur. In that case, the on-hand quantity
in the database can change and no longer be consistent with the counted
quantity. As an extra precaution, Odoo asks for confirmation before
applying the inventory adjustment.
::::

## Revert an inventory adjustment

To revert the changes made in an inventory adjustment, navigate to
`Inventory -->
Reporting --> Moves History`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Tick the checkbox at the far left of the line for the desired product.
At the top of the page, click the `fa-gear`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to open
a drop-down menu, and click `Revert
Inventory Adjustment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

After an inventory adjustment is reverted, the line is not removed from
the `Moves
History`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report. Instead, an
additional line is added, this time with the word
[\[reverted\]]{.title-ref} added to the `Reference`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column.

![The reference fields on the Moves History report in the Inventory app.](count_products/reverted-adjustment.png)

## Change inventory count frequency

By default, the *scheduled date* for inventory adjustments are always
scheduled for the 31st of December of the current year. However, for
some companies, it is crucial that they have an accurate inventory count
at all times. In such cases, the default scheduled date can be modified.

To modify the default scheduled date, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Then, in the
`Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, locate the
`Annual Inventory Day
and Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting, which includes a
drop-down menu that is set to [31 December]{.title-ref} by default.

![Adjust the next inventory count date with the Annual Inventory Day and Month setting.](count_products/annual-inventory.png)

To change the day, click the [31]{.title-ref}, enter a number from
[1-31]{.title-ref}, depending on the desired month of the year.

Then, to change the month, click `December`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to reveal the drop-down menu, and select the desired
month.

Once all desired changes have been made, click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to save all changes.

### Plan big inventory counts {#inventory/plan-counts}

To plan big inventory counts, such as a full count of everything
currently in stock, first navigate to
`Inventory app --> Operations --> Physical Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Then, select the desired products to be counted by ticking the checkbox
on the far left of each product line.

:::: tip

`Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} label. This selects
**all** product lines.
::::

![Request a count pop-up on inventory adjustments page.](count_products/count-popup.png)

Once all desired products have been selected, click the
`Request a Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top
of the page. Doing so opens the `Request a Count`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window, where the following information can be
filled:

- `Inventory Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the planned date
  of the count.
- `User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the user responsible for
  the count.
- `Accounting Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date at
  which the inventory adjustment will be accounted.
- `Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to leave the on-hand
  quantity of each product line blank, select
  `Leave Empty`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To pre-fill the
  on-hand quantity of each product line with the current value recorded
  in the database, select `Set Current Value`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Leave Empty`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option forces the
employee conducting the audit to manually type in the number they
counted, while the `Set Current Value`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option only requires the employee to *verify* the
counted quantity and click `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

Finally, once ready, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to request the count.

### Inventory audit

An inventory audit can be accessed from the
`Inventory Adjustment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page. This
audit includes an inventory record both before and after a count is
completed, to track what changed.

On the `Inventory Adjustment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page,
tick the checkbox at the top-left of the page to select all of the
lines. Then click the `Request a Count`{.interpreted-text

# Cycle counts

For most companies, warehouse stock only needs to be counted once a
year. This is why, by default, after making an *inventory adjustment* in
Odoo, the scheduled date for the next inventory count is set for the
31st of December of the current year.

However, for some businesses, it\'s crucial to have an accurate
inventory count at all times. These companies use *cycle counts* to keep
critical stock levels accurate. Cycle counting is a method by which
companies count their inventory more often in certain *locations*, to
ensure that their physical inventory counts match their inventory
records.

## Configuration

In Odoo, cycle counts are performed by location. Therefore, the *Storage
Locations* feature needs to be enabled before performing a cycle count.

To enable this feature, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and scroll down to the
`Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Then, tick the
checkbox next to `Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Enabled Storage Locations setting in inventory settings.](cycle_counts/cycle-counts-enabled-setting.png){.align-center}

## Change inventory count frequency by location

Once the *Storage Locations* feature is enabled, and there are multiple
locations created in the warehouse, the inventory count frequency can be
changed for specific locations.

To view and edit locations, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Locations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. This reveals a
`Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page containing every
location currently created and listed in the warehouse.

From this page, click into a location to reveal the settings and
configuration page for that location.

Under the `Cyclic Counting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
locate the `Inventory Frequency (Days)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, which should be set to [0]{.title-ref} by
default (if this location has not been edited previously). In this
field, change the value to any number of days desired for the frequency
of counts.

![Location frequency setting on location.](cycle_counts/cycle-counts-frequency-value.png){.align-center}

::: example
A location that needs an inventory count every 30 days should have the
`Inventory
Frequency (Days)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} value set to
[30]{.title-ref}.
:::

Now, once an inventory adjustment is applied to this location, the next
scheduled count date is automatically set, based on the value entered
into the `Inventory Frequency (Days)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

## Count inventory by location

To perform a cycle count for a specific location in the warehouse,
navigate to
`Inventory app --> Operations --> Physical Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. This reveals an
`Inventory Adjustments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page
containing all products currently in-stock, with each product listed on
its own line.

From this page, the `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options (accessible by
clicking the `⬇️ (down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon,
to the right of the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar),
can be used to select specific locations and perform inventory counts.

To select a specific location, and view all products within that
location, click the `⬇️
(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, to the right of
the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar. Then, in the
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, click
`Add Custom Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to reveal a new
drop-down menu.

![Filters and Group By menu on Inventory Adjustments page.](cycle_counts/cycle-counts-filter-menu.png){.align-center}

Click `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down
menu. Doing so sorts products into their storage locations on the
`Inventory Adjustments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, and a
cycle count can be performed for all products in that location.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

In large warehouses with multiple locations and a high volume of
products, it might be easier to search for the specific location
desired. To do this, from the `Inventory Adjustments`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, click the `⬇️ (down arrow)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon to the right of the `Search...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} bar.

Then, in the `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, click
`Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open an
`Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

In the first field, click the value and select
`Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the list of options.
Select `contains`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the second
field. In the third field, type in the name of the location being
searched for.

Click `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for that location to
appear on the page.

![Add Custom Filter pop-up window with location values entered.](cycle_counts/cycle-counts-add-custom-filter.png){.align-center}
::::

## Change full inventory count frequency

While cycle counts are typically performed per location, the scheduled
date for full inventory counts of all in-stock products in the warehouse
can also be manually changed, to push the date up sooner than the date
listed.

To modify the default scheduled date, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Then, in the
`Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, locate the
`Annual Inventory Day
and Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting field, which
includes a drop-down field that is set to [31]{.title-ref}
`December`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, by default.

![Frequency field in inventory app settings.](cycle_counts/cycle-counts-frequency-calendar.png){.align-center}

To change the day, click the [31]{.title-ref}, and change it to a day
within the range [1-31]{.title-ref}, depending on the desired month of
the year.

Then, to change the month, click `December`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to reveal the drop-down menu, and select the desired
month.

Once all necessary changes have been made, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Product catalog

The product *catalog* is a feature integrated with any Odoo app that
allows users to add products or components to an order. This includes
the **Inventory**, **Manufacturing**, **Sales**, **Purchase**, and
**Repairs** apps, among others.

The product catalog can be accessed from the first tab of a quotation,
request for quotation (RfQ), order, or bill of materials (BoM) form, and
opens in a new page when selected. The catalog displays products and
components in a user-friendly, POS-style format, from which they can be
selected and added to forms.

The product catalog simplifies the creation of new sales orders (SOs),
purchase orders (POs), manufacturing orders (MOs), bill of materials
(BoMs), and more, by providing a visual interface through which products
and components can be quickly selected.

## Use product catalog

To use the product catalog, begin by creating or opening a quotation,
`RfQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, order, or
`BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to which
products or components can be added. For example, create a new sales
quotation by navigating to `Sales app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and clicking `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

On the form (quotation, `RfQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, order, `BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}), make sure the first tab on the bottom is selected.
Depending on the form being configured, this tab may be titled *Order
Lines*, *Components*, *Products*, or *Parts*.

On the first blank line of the tab, click the
`Catalog`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} link to open the catalog in
a new page.

![The \"Catalog\" button on the \"Order Lines\" tab of a sales quotation.](product_catalog/catalog-button.png){.align-center}

The product catalog displays a card for each product added to Odoo. Each
card displays a few key details about the corresponding product:

- Product photo
- Product title
- Price or cost of the product, depending on whether it is bought, sold,
  or used as a component
- Reference code (e.g. *DESK0005*)
- On-hand quantity
- Variant attributes (e.g. *Color: White*)

![A product card in the product catalog.](product_catalog/product-card.png){.align-center}

Products can be filtered using the search bar at the top of the page, or
the sidebar on the left side of the page.

To filter by product type, click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on
the right side of the search bar to open the search menu. In the
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, select the
`Services`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter to only show
service products, or the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
filter to only show physical products.

When creating or configuring a quotation or
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, specifically, an
`In the Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter appears in the
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the search bar.
Select this filter to only show products that have already been added to
the form.

In the sidebar on the left side of the page, select an option in the
`fa-th-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`PRODUCT CATEGORY`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section to filter
by product category, or an option in the `fa-th-list`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `ATTRIBUTES`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section to
filter by variant attribute.

![The filter sidebar in the product catalog.](product_catalog/filter-sidebar.png){.align-center}

To add a product, click on the product\'s card, or click the
`fa-shopping-cart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the bottom-right
corner of the card. Doing so adds one unit of the product, which is
displayed in a field in the bottom-left corner of the card.

Once a product has been added, clicking the product card continues to
add units of the product in increments of one.

To adjust the quantity of the product added, click the
`fa-minus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(minus)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to reduce the quantity by one, or the
`fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(plus)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to increase it by one.

Alternatively, a specific quantity can be entered by selecting the field
between the `fa-minus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(minus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(plus)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} buttons, and typing in the desired quantity.

To remove a product from the order or
`BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} entirely,
either click the `fa-trash`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Remove`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the bottom-right
corner of the product card, or click the `fa-minus`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(minus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button until
the quantity has been reduced to zero.

![A product card for a product that has been added.](product_catalog/added-product.png){.align-center}

Once the desired quantity of each product has been added, return to the
form by clicking the `Back to [X]`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button at the top of the screen. This button differs depending on the
type of form being configured (quotation,
`BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, etc.).

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Products appear in the product catalog, and can be added to orders, even
if there are zero units of the product on hand. As a result, it is
important to confirm the quantity of a product being added to an order
is actually available, or inventory inconsistencies may arise.

# Scrap inventory

Sometimes, products in a company\'s warehouse stock might be found to be
damaged or defective, past the point of being reparable. If it is not
possible to repair the product, or return the product to a vendor, it
can be scrapped.

Odoo *Inventory* allows users to scrap inventory, designating goods or
materials that are no longer usable or sellable for disposal (or
recycling).

Scrapping inventory in a database helps stock counts remain accurate, by
removing scrapped products from physical inventory, and placing it in a
virtual scrap location (*Virtual Locations/Scrap*).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

*Virtual locations* in Odoo are **not** real, physical spaces in a
warehouse. Rather, they are designated locations in a database that
provide tracking of items that shouldn\'t be counted in a physical
inventory.

For more information about virtual locations, see the documentation
about the different types of
`location types <inventory/warehouses_storage/location-type>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

## Scrap from stock

To create a new scrap order (SP) for an in-stock product, navigate to
`Inventory app
--> Operations --> Scrap`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This opens a new
`SP (Scrap Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form.

Click the drop-down menu in the `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, and select the product that should be scrapped
from inventory. In the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, change the value to the quantity of the product that should be
scrapped (by default, this value is set to [1.00]{.title-ref}).

![Filled out new scrap order form with product details.](scrap_inventory/scrap-inventory-new-scrap-order.png){.align-center}

The `Source Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} defaults to the
location where the product is currently stored. The
`Scrap Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} defaults to the
designated scrap location (`Virtual
Locations/Scrap`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}). Either of these
locations can be changed by selecting a different location from their
respective drop-down menus.

If the scrapping is tied to a specific existing operation, specify the
operation in the `Source Document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

The `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field displays the
company whose warehouse this product belongs to. If a replenishment rule
is set up for the product being scrapped, and if the product should be
replenished, tick the checkbox for
`Replenish Quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Once ready, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
complete the new `SP (Scrap Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Once
validated, a `Product Moves`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button appears at the top of the form. Click the smart button to view
the details of the scrap operation.

![Product Moves smart button on new scrap order form.](scrap_inventory/scrap-inventory-product-moves-button.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To view the all-time total quantities of scrapped items, navigate to
`Inventory
app --> Configuration --> Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click the `x (remove)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the `Internal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} filter in the `Search...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} bar, to display virtual locations.

Select the `Virtual Locations/Scrap`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
location. From the `Scrap`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
location\'s form, click the `Current Stock`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button, at the top of the form.

A list of all scrapped products, and their quantities, is displayed.

![Current Stock list of all scrapped products in virtual scrap location.](scrap_inventory/scrap-inventory-current-stock.png){.align-center}
::::

## Scrap from an existing operation

Scrap orders (SPs) can *also* be created from existing operations, such
as receipts, delivery orders, and internal transfers, before they are
entered into, or removed from, stock for an operation.

To scrap a product during an operation, navigate to the
`Inventory app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. From the
`Inventory Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click the
`# To Process`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on an
operation\'s task card (i.e. the `Receipts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} task card).

![\# To Process button on Receipts task card on Inventory Overview page.](scrap_inventory/scrap-inventory-receipts-task-card.png){.align-center}

Then, select an operation to process from the resulting list of existing
orders. Doing so opens that operation\'s form.

Click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(cog)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, and select
`Scrap`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the resulting drop-down
menu. This opens a `Scrap Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window.

![Scrap Products pop-up window on operation form.](scrap_inventory/scrap-inventory-popup-window.png){.align-center}

From this pop-up window, click the drop-down menu in the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and select the
products from the operation that should be scrapped. Adjust the value in
the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, if necessary.

If the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} selected is tracked
using a lot or serial number, a `Lot/Serial`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field appears. Specify the tracking number in that
field.

The `Source Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Scrap Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be changed, if
needed. If a replenishment rule is set up for the product being
scrapped, and if the product should be replenished, tick the checkbox
for `Replenish Quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Once ready, click `Scrap Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. A
`Scraps`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button appears at the
top of the operation form. Click this smart button to view the details
of all scrap orders created from this specific operation.

![Scraps smart button showing all scrap orders from operation.](scrap_inventory/scrap-inventory-scraps-smart-button.png){.align-center}

# Locations

A *location* is a specific space within a warehouse. This can be a
shelf, room, aisle, etc.

## Configuration

To create specific storage locations, enable the *Storage Locations*
feature by going to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. In the `Warehouses`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, tick the `Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox. Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Typically, the `Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
feature is used with `Multi-Step Routes
<../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/use_routes>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, which controls how products move between locations.
::::

![Show Storage Locations feature.](use_locations/enable-location.png){.align-center}

## Create new location

After enabling *Storage Locations*, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Locations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

![List of internal locations.](use_locations/locations.png){.align-center}

On this page, click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The new
location form can then be configured as follows:

- `Location Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: recognizable name
  of the location.

- `Parent Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the location
  within which the new location exists. After the location is created,
  it is listed on the `Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  page using a *location hierarchy*, to describe how a specific location
  fits within larger areas of the warehouse.

  ::: example
  In [WH/Stock/Zone A/Refrigerator 1]{.title-ref}, \"Refrigerator 1\" is
  the location name, \"Zone A\" is the parent location, and everything
  before it is the path showing where this spot is within the warehouse.
  :::

### Additional Information section

In addition to the required fields above, configure the following
location fields to ensure the location serves its intended purpose in
the database:

- `Location Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: from the drop-down
  menu, choose `Vendor Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Internal Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Customer Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Inventory Loss`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Transit Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to categorize
  the location. For details on each location type, refer to the
  `Location Types section
  <inventory/warehouses_storage/location-type>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- `Storage Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: only available
  with the `Storage Categories

  role="doc"} feature enabled in
  `Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the company the location
  belongs to.
- `Is a Scrap Location?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: tick this
  checkbox to allow for scrapped/damaged goods to be stored in this
  location.
- `Is a Return Location?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: tick this
  checkbox to allow products to be returned to this location.
- `Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: used with the *Barcode*
  app, enter the barcode to `identify actions
  <barcode/setup/location>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} at this
  location when scanned.
- `Replenish Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: used for
  `configuring routes
  <../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/use_routes>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, tick this checkbox to set the location as a destination
  for receiving products from *Buy*, *Manufacture*, or other procurement
  routes, ensuring products are correctly supplied to the warehouse.

![Additional Information section of new location creation form.](use_locations/new-location.png){.align-center}

Configure the remaining fields in the
`Additional Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section as
follows:

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the company whose
  warehouse the location is inside of. Leave this field blank if this
  location is shared between companies.
- `Is a Scrap Location?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: tick this
  checkbox to allow for scrapped/damaged goods to be stored in this
  location.
- `Is a Return Location?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: tick this
  checkbox to allow products to be returned to this location.
- `Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the barcode assigned to
  the location.
- `Replenish Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: tick this
  checkbox to get all quantities to replenish at this location.

In the `Cyclic Counting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
change the value in the `Inventory Frequency
(Days)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field from the default
[0]{.title-ref}, if necessary.

![Cyclic Counting section of new location creation form.](use_locations/use-locations-cyclic-counting.png){.align-center}

When different than [0]{.title-ref}, the inventory count dates for
products stored at this location are automatically set at the defined
frequency.

In the `Logistics`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, in the
`Removal Strategy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, click the
drop-down menu and select the
`removal strategy <../../shipping_receiving/removal_strategies>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for how items should be removed from this location.

### Cyclic Counting section {#inventory/location-hierarchy}

To schedule regular inventory counts at this location, set the
`Inventory Frequency
(Days)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to the desired
interval. By default, it is set to [0]{.title-ref} (no scheduled
counts).

For example, setting this field to [30]{.title-ref}, schedules a count
every thirty days. For more specifics on setting up and using this
feature, refer to the
`Cycle Counts documentation <cycle_counts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

The `Last Effective Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
displays the date the last inventory count at this location occurred.
When scheduled inventory counts are enabled, the `Next Expected
Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field displays the date of
the next inventory count.

::: example
With inventory counts scheduled to occur every [30]{.title-ref} days,
and the `Last Effective
Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} count occurring on July
16, the `Next Expected Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
August 15.

![Show Cyclic Count section of the locations form.](use_locations/scheduled-count.png){.align-center}

### Logistics section

In the `Logistics`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
locations form, optionally select a `Removal
Strategy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to determine the order and
priority of how products are picked from inventory. The options are:
`First In First Out (FIFO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Last In First Out (LIFO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Closest
Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`First Expiry First Out (FEFO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Warehouses

In the Odoo *Inventory* app, a *warehouse* is a physical space with an
address for storing items, such as a storage facility, distribution
center, or physical store.

Each database has a pre-configured warehouse with the company\'s
address. Users can set up multiple warehouses, and
`create stock moves <../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/use_routes>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} between them.

## Configuration

To create or manage warehouses, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Warehouses`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Then, select an existing warehouse, or create a new one by clicking
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so opens the warehouse
form, which contains the following fields:

- `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (*required field*): the
  full name of the warehouse.

- `Short Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (*required field*):
  the abbreviated code for the warehouse (maximum five characters). The
  short name for the default warehouse in Odoo is [WH]{.title-ref}.

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  The `Short Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears on
  warehouse documents, so it is recommended to use a memorable one, like
  \"WH\[first letters of location\]\" (e.g. [WHA]{.title-ref},
  [WHB]{.title-ref}, etc.).
  ::::

- `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (*required field*): the
  address of the warehouse. To change the warehouse address when
  creating two or more warehouses, hover over the field, and click the
  `fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(right arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (*required field*): the
  company that owns the warehouse; this can be set as the company that
  owns the Odoo database, or the company of a customer or vendor.

- `Intrastat region`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: `region name
  <../../../../finance/accounting/reporting/intrastat>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} required for companies in the European Union.

# Inventory management

In the Odoo *Inventory* app,
`warehouses <inventory_management/warehouses>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} handle the broader organization and distribution of stock
across different physical sites, while `locations
<inventory_management/use_locations>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
provide a more detailed breakdown within each warehouse for efficient
item management.

This document serves as an introduction to the terminology and concepts
necessary to master *Inventory*. For specific instructions and examples
of how things work, refer to individual documentation pages.

::: seealso
[Odoo Tutorials: Warehouses &
Locations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMvudZVLuUo)
:::

## Warehouses

`Warehouses <inventory_management/warehouses>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} represent a physical place, with a physical address, where a
company\'s items are stored.

Configure
`routes <../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/use_routes>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} in a warehouse to control how products move to customers,
from vendors, within the warehouse, or `between
warehouses <replenishment/resupply_warehouses>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

## Locations

`Locations <inventory_management/use_locations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} refer to specific areas within a warehouse, such as shelves,
floors, or aisles. These are sub-divisions within a warehouse, and are
unique to that warehouse. Users can create and manage numerous locations
within a single warehouse to organize inventory more precisely.

:::

### Location types {#inventory/warehouses_storage/location-type}

*Location types* in Odoo help categorize and manage where products are,
and what actions need to be taken with them. By default, on the
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} page, only internal locations are displayed.

To view the seven location types in Odoo, select any location, and in
the `Location Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, there are:

- `Vendor Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: defines an area
  where products purchased from vendors originate. Items here are
  **not** in stock.

- `View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: used to organize and
  structure the warehouse hierarchy. For example, the view location
  [WH]{.title-ref} (short for warehouse) groups all internal locations,
  such as [Stock]{.title-ref}, receiving docks, quality checkpoints, and
  packing areas to show they all belong to the same warehouse.

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  View locations should **not** contain products, but it is possible to
  move them there.
  ::::

- `Internal Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: storage
  locations within the warehouse. Items stored in these locations are
  accounted for in `inventory valuation
  <../product_management/inventory_valuation/using_inventory_valuation>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.

- `Customer Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: where sold
  products are tracked; items here are no longer in stock.

- `Inventory Loss`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: counterpart
  location to consume missing items or create stock, accounting for
  discrepancies.

  In Odoo, examples of inventory loss locations are *Inventory
  Adjustment*, used to account for discrepancies during an inventory
  count, and *Scrap*, which is where damaged goods are sent to account
  for inventory losses.

  > ::: example
  > [Virtual Locations/Inventory Adjustment]{.title-ref} is a location
  > with the `Inventory Loss`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} type.
  > The database shows [65]{.title-ref} units in [WH/Stock]{.title-ref},
  > but an inventory check reveals [60]{.title-ref}. To correct the
  > quantity, five units are moved from [WH/Stock]{.title-ref} to
  > [Virtual Locations/Inventory Adjustment]{.title-ref}.
  >
  > ![Product ends up in Virtual Locations/Inventory Adjustment.](inventory_management/inventory-loss.png){.align-center}
  > :::

- `Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: where raw materials
  are consumed, and `manufactured products
  <../../manufacturing>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} are created.

- `Transit Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: used for
  inter-company or inter-warehouse operations to track products shipped
  between different addresses, such as
  `Physical Locations/Inter-warehouse
  transit <inventory/warehouses_storage/interwarehouse-transit>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

![List of locations in Odoo.](inventory_management/locations.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In Odoo, location types are color-coded: - **Red**: internal locations -
**Blue**: view locations - **Black**: external locations (including
inventory loss, vendor, and customer locations).
::::

### View locations in Odoo

Odoo databases include preconfigured view locations to organize the
hierarchy of locations. These provide helpful context, and distinguish
between internal and external locations.

- *Physical locations* group internal locations---such as secondary
  warehouses and subcontractor sites. Because `inventory valuation
  <../product_management/inventory_valuation/inventory_valuation_config>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} changes only when goods move from internal to external
  locations, Odoo uses physical locations to track stock that is
  off-site or in transit without affecting valuation.

::: {#inventory/warehouses_storage/interwarehouse-transit}
> ::: example
> When moving products in warehouses [WH]{.title-ref} and
> [WH2]{.title-ref}, the items are not in either warehouse, but still
> belong to the company. While in transit, they are placed in the
> [Inter-warehouse transit]{.title-ref} location, a
> `Transit Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} type.
>
> This location is under the view location, [Physical
> Locations]{.title-ref}, indicating that [Inter-warehouse
> transit]{.title-ref} is outside of a warehouse, but still part of the
> company. Doing so does not affect the inventory valuation of the
> products.
> :::
:::

- *Partner locations* group customer and vendor locations (external
  locations) together. Transfers to these locations affect inventory
  valuation.
- *Virtual locations* are locations that do **not** exist physically,
  but it is where items that are not in inventory can be placed. These
  can be items that are no longer in inventory due to loss, or other
  factors.

# Lead times

Accurately forecasting delivery dates is vital for fulfilling customer
expectations. In Odoo, the **Inventory** app allows for comprehensive
lead time configuration, allowing coordination and planning of
manufacturing orders, deliveries, and receipts.

## Lead time types

Different lead times for different operations can impact various stages
of the order fulfillment process. Here\'s a summary of the types of lead
times in Odoo:

![Show graphic of all lead times working together.](lead_times/all-lead-times.png)

- `Customer lead time <inventory/warehouses_storage/customer-lt>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: default time frame for fulfilling customer orders. The
  customer lead time is the number of days from the date the sales order
  (SO) is confirmed to the date the products are shipped from the
  warehouse. This is also known as *delivery lead time*.
- `Sales security lead time <inventory/warehouses_storage/sales-security-lt>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: moves the *scheduled delivery date* forward by a
  specified number of days. This serves as a buffer to allow ample time
  to prepare the outgoing shipment earlier, considering the possibility
  of delays in the fulfillment process.
- `Purchase lead time <inventory/warehouses_storage/purchase-lt>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: number of days from the confirmation of a purchase order
  (PO) to the receipt of products. It provides insight on the time it
  takes for products to arrive at the warehouse, facilitating effective
  scheduling and planning of supplier deliveries.
- `Purchase security lead time <inventory/warehouses_storage/purchase-security-lt>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: advances the order deadline on a
  `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by a specified
  number of days. This proactive approach of placing orders earlier
  mitigates the risk of vendor or shipping delays. Thus, for products
  that are set to replenish to order, the need appears on the
  *Replenishment report* earlier, according to the specified number of
  days.
- `Days to Purchase <inventory/warehouses_storage/days-to-purchase>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: days needed for the vendor to receive a request for
  quotation (RFQ) and confirm it. It advances the deadline to schedule a
  `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by a
  specified number of days.
- `Manufacturing lead time <inventory/warehouses_storage/manuf-lt>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: number of days needed to complete a manufacturing order
  (MO) from the date of confirmation. This lead time includes weekends
  (non-working hours in Odoo), and is used to forecast an approximate
  production date for a finished good.
- `Days to prepare manufacturing order
  <inventory/warehouses_storage/prepare-manufacturing-order>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: number of days needed to replenish components, or
  manufacture sub-assemblies of the product. Either set one directly on
  the bill of materials (BoM), or click *Compute* to sum up purchase and
  manufacturing lead times of components in the
  `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
- `Manufacturing security lead time <inventory/warehouses_storage/manuf-security-lt>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: moves the scheduled date of the
  `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} forward by a
  specified number of days. When used in conjunction with
  `replenish to order <inventory/management/products/strategies>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, the security lead time makes the need appear earlier on
  the replenishment report.

## Sales lead times {#inventory/warehouses_storage/customer-lt}

Customer lead times and sales security lead times can be configured to
automatically compute an *expected delivery date* on a
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. The expected delivery
date ensures a realistic *delivery dates* setting for shipments from the
warehouse.

Odoo issues a warning message if the set delivery date is earlier than
the expected date, as it may not be feasible to fulfill the order by
that time, which would impact other warehouse operations.

::: example
A `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} containing a
[Coconut-scented candle]{.title-ref} is confirmed on July 11th. The
product has a customer lead time of 14 days, and the business uses a
sales security lead time of 1 day. Based on the lead time inputs, Odoo
suggests a delivery date in 15 days, on July 26th.

![Set \*Delivery Date\* in a sales order. Enables delivery lead times feature.](lead_times/scheduled-date.png)
:::

The following sections demonstrate how to automatically compute expected
delivery dates.

### Customer lead time

Set the customer lead time on each product form, by navigating to the
products page. To do so, go to
`Sales app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. From there, select the desired product, and
switch to the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Then,
under the `Customer Lead Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
fill in the number of calendar days required to fulfill the delivery
order from start to finish.

::: example
Set a 14-day customer lead time for the [Coconut-scented
candle]{.title-ref} by navigating to its product form. Then, in the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, type
[14.00]{.title-ref} days into the `Customer Lead
Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![Set \*Customer Lead Time\* on the product form.](lead_times/customer.png)
:::

### Sales security lead time {#inventory/warehouses_storage/sales-security-lt}

*Sales security lead time* is set globally for the business in
`Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

On the configuration page, under the
`Advanced Scheduling`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading, locate
the box for `Security Lead Time for Sales`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and click the checkbox to enable the feature.

Next, enter the desired number of calendar days. This security lead time
is a buffer notifying the team to prepare for outgoing shipments earlier
than the scheduled date.

::: example
Setting the `Security Lead Time for Sales`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to [1.00]{.title-ref} day, pushes the
`Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of a delivery order
(DO) forward by one day. In that case, if a product is initially
scheduled for delivery on April 6th, but with a one-day security lead
time, the new scheduled date for the delivery order would be April 5th.

![View of the security lead time for sales configuration from the sales settings.](lead_times/sales-security.png)
:::

### Deliver several products

For orders that include multiple products with different lead times, the
lead times can be configured directly from the quotation itself. On a
quotation, click the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, and set the `Shipping Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to:

1.  `As soon as possible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to deliver
    products as soon as they are ready. The
    `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the
    `DO (Delivery Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is determined
    by adding today\'s date to the shortest lead time among the products
    in the order.
2.  `When all products are ready`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
    wait to fulfill the entire order at once. The
    `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the
    `DO (Delivery Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is determined
    by adding today\'s date to the longest lead time among the products
    in the order.

![Show \*Shipping Policy\* field in the \*Other Info\* tab of a quotation.](lead_times/shipping-policy.png)

::: example
In a quotation containing 2 products, [Yoga mat]{.title-ref} and
[Resistance band,]{.title-ref} the products have a lead time of 8 days
and 5 days, respectively. Today\'s date is April 2nd.

When the `Shipping Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
`As soon as possible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the scheduled
delivery date is 5 days from today: April 7th. On the other hand,
selecting `When all
products are ready`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} configures the
scheduled date to be 8 days from today: April 10th.
:::

## Purchase lead times

Automatically scheduling supplier orders streamlines procurement by
showing users exactly when to confirm a request for quotation (RFQ) and
when to expect the goods.

  Field              Description
  ------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Order Deadline     Last calendar day to confirm the `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and convert it to a `PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  Expected Arrival   Arrival date of the products. Calculated by *Order Deadline* + *Vendor Lead Time*

  : Key dates on an RFQ / PO

In addition, Odoo has global security lead times, which are buffers that
widen the
`just-in-time <inventory/warehouses_storage/just-in-time>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (JIT) forecast window. The security lead times affect
**only** replenishment methods that use `pull rules
<../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/use_routes>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}---for example `reordering rules
<reordering_rules>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} or
`make to order (MTO) <mto>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. They do not
change the interval between *Order Deadline* and *Expected Arrival*.

- `Vendor Lead Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: 1 day
- `Purchase Security Lead Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: 4
  days
- `Days to Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: 2 days

Days from today = 1 + 4 + 2 = 7

### Vendor lead time {#inventory/warehouses_storage/purchase-lt}

To set a vendor lead time for orders arriving in the warehouse from a
vendor location, begin by navigating to a product form through
`Purchase app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Next, select the desired product, and switch to the
`Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. In the editable
vendor pricelist, click the `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to add vendor details, such as the
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} name,
`Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} offered for the product, and
lastly, the `Delivery Lead Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note

![Add delivery lead times to vendor pricelist on a product.](lead_times/set-vendor.png)
:::

### Purchase security lead time {#inventory/warehouses_storage/purchase-security-lt}

*Purchase security lead time* is a global buffer to account for delays,
applied to **all** vendors. To set it, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Under `Advanced Scheduling`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, tick the
`Security Lead Time for Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox.

Next, enter the desired number of calendar days. By configuring the
security lead time, a buffer is set to account for potential delays in
supplier deliveries. Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

### Days to purchase lead time {#inventory/warehouses_storage/days-to-purchase}

To set it up, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Under the `Advanced Scheduling`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, in the `Days to Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, specify the number of days required for the
vendor to confirm a `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} after receiving it from the company.

## Manufacturing lead times {#inventory/warehouses_storage/manuf-lt}

Lead times can help simplify the procurement process for consumable
materials and components used in manufactured products with bills of
materials (BoMs).

The `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} deadline,
which is the deadline to begin the manufacturing process to complete the
product by the scheduled delivery date, can be determined by configuring
the manufacturing lead times and manufacturing security lead times.

![Visualization of the determination of planned MO date manufacturing lead times.](lead_times/manuf-lead-times.png)

### Manufacturing lead time

Manufacturing lead times for products are configured from a product\'s
bill of materials (BoM) form.

To add a lead time to a `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, navigate to `Manufacturing app --> Products --> Bills
of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select the
desired `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
edit.

On the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form,
click the `Miscellaneous`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Change
the value (in days) in the `Manuf. Lead Time`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field to specify the calendar days needed to
manufacture the product.

![Manuf. Lead Time value specified on a product\'s Bill of Material form.](lead_times/set-manufacturing.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the selected `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
is a multi-level `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, the manufacturing lead times of the components are added.

If the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} product
is subcontracted, the `Manuf. Lead Time`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} can be used to determine the date at which components
should be sent to the subcontractor.
::::

Establish a `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
deadline, based on the *expected delivery date*, indicated in the
`Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field of the
`DO (Delivery Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

The `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} deadline,
which is the `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
on the `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, is
calculated as the *expected delivery date* subtracted by the
manufacturing lead time.

This ensures the manufacturing process begins on time, in order to meet
the delivery date.

However, it is important to note that lead times are based on calendar
days. Lead times do **not** consider weekends, holidays, or *work center
capacity* (`the number of operations that can be
performed at the work center simultaneously`{.interpreted-text
role="dfn"}).

product requires 14 days to manufacture. So, the latest date to start
the `MO

commitment date is August 1st.
:::

### Days to prepare manufacturing order {#inventory/warehouses_storage/prepare-manufacturing-order}

Configure the days required to gather components to manufacture a
product by going to its `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. To do that, go to
`Manufacturing app --> Products --> Bills of Materials`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the desired
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

In the `Miscellaneous`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, specify the
calendar days needed to obtain components of the product in the
`Days to prepare Manufacturing Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. Doing so creates `MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} in advance, and ensures there is enough time to either
replenish components, or manufacture semi-finished products.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Clicking `Compute`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, located next to
the `Days to prepare Manufacturing Order`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, calculates the longest lead time among all the
components listed on the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

*Purchase security lead times* that impact this specific
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are also added
to this value.
::::

::: example
A `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} has two
components, one has a manufacturing lead time of two days, and the other
has a purchase lead time of four days. The
`Days to prepare Manufacturing Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
is four days.
:::

### Manufacturing security lead time {#inventory/warehouses_storage/manuf-security-lt}

*Manufacturing security lead time* is set globally for the business in
`Manufacturing
app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Under the `Planning`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} heading, tick the checkbox for
`Security Lead Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Next, enter the desired number of calendar days. By configuring the
security lead time, a buffer is set to account for potential delays in
the manufacturing process. Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![View of the security lead time for manufacturing from the manufacturing app settings.](lead_times/manuf-security.png)

::: example
A product has a scheduled shipment date on the
`DO (Delivery Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} set for August
15th. The manufacturing lead time is 7 days, and manufacturing security
lead time is 3 days. So, the `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} reflects the latest date to begin the manufacturing order.
In this example, the planned date on the
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is August 5th.
:::

## Global example

See the following example to understand how all the lead times work
together to ensure timely order fulfillment:

- **Sales security lead time**: 1 day
- **Manufacturing security lead time**: 2 days
- **Manufacturing lead time**: 3 days
- **Purchase security lead time**: 1 day
- **Vendor lead time**: 4 days

The customer places an order for a manufactured product on September
1st, and the scheduled delivery date from the warehouse is on September
20th. Odoo uses lead times and automated reordering rules to schedule
the necessary operations, based on the outgoing shipment delivery date,
September 20th:

![Show timeline of how lead times work together to schedule warehouse operations.](lead_times/global-example.png)

- **September 1st**: Sales order created, confirmed by salesperson.
- **September 9th**: Deadline to order components to ensure they arrive
  in time when manufacturing begins (4-day supplier lead time).
- **September 13th**: Scheduled date of receipt for components.
  Initially, it was set to 9/14, but the 1-day purchase security lead
  time pushed the date earlier by 1 day.
- **September 14th**: Deadline to begin manufacturing. Calculated by
  subtracting the manufacturing lead time of 3 days, and the
  manufacturing security lead time of 2 days, from the expected delivery
  date of September 19th.
- **September 19th**: `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} on the delivery order form indicates the updated
  expected delivery date, which was originally set as September 20th.
  But the sales security lead time pushed the date forward by a day.

Odoo\'s replenishment planning maps a business\' order fulfillment
process, setting pre-determined deadlines and raw material order dates,
including buffer days for potential delays. This ensures products are
delivered on time.

# Replenish on order (MTO)

*Replenish on order*, also known as *MTO* (make to order), is a
replenishment strategy that creates a draft order every time a product
is needed to fulfill a sales order (SO) or as a component in a
manufacturing order (MO).

- For
  `purchased products <../../../purchase/manage_deals/rfq>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, Odoo creates a
  `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
- For `manufactured products
  <../../../manufacturing/basic_setup/configure_manufacturing_product>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, it creates a `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"}

If stock is available, no
`RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is generated
and the sale proceeds normally. Otherwise, the
`RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is generated
and directly linked to the originating
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} through a smart
button.

This approach offers clear traceability, since each
`RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is tied back
to its demand.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} generated by
`MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is designed to
fulfill the originating `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. These documents should normally be confirmed or adjusted
rather than cancelled. If the demand changes, update the document
instead of cancelling it.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If an `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is cancelled,
Odoo does not automatically generate a replacement. A new replenishment
document must be created manually, but it **cannot** be linked back to
the original `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} through
the smart button.

Finally, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the
change.
::::

## Unarchive MTO route {#inventory/warehouses_storage/unarchive-mto}

In order to use the `MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
route, the `Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
feature must be enabled. To do so, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and tick the checkbox next to
`Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, under the
`Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading.

By default, Odoo sets the `MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} route as *archived*. This is because
`MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is a somewhat niche
workflow that is only used by certain companies. However, it is easy to
unarchive the route in just a few simple steps.

To do so, begin by navigating to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Routes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. On the `Routes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon on
the right side of the search bar, and click the
`Archived`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter to enable it.

![The archived filter on the Routes page.](mto/archived-filter.png){.align-center}

After enabling the `Archived`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter,
the `Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page shows all routes
which are currently archived. Tick the checkbox next to
`Replenish on Order (MTO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then
click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to reveal a
drop-down menu. From the drop-down menu, select
`Unarchive`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The unarchive action on the Routes page.](mto/unarchive-button.png){.align-center}

Finally, remove the `Archived`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter
from the search bar. The `Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
page now shows all unarchived routes, including
`Replenish on Order (MTO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which is
selectable on the *Inventory* tab of each product page.

## Configure product for MTO

With the `MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} route
unarchived, products can now be properly configured to use replenish on
order. To do so, begin by going to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then select an existing product, or click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to configure a new one.

On the product page, select the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab and enable the `Replenish on
Order (MTO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} route in the
`Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, along with the
`Buy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Manufacture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} route.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Replenish on Order (MTO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} route
**does not** work unless another route is selected as well. This is
because Odoo needs to know how to replenish the product when an order is
placed for it (buy or manufacture it).
::::

![Select the MTO route and a second route on the Inventory tab.](mto/select-routes.png){.align-center}

If the product is purchased from a vendor to fulfill
`SOs (sales orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, enable the
`Can be Purchased`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox under the
product name. Doing so makes the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab appear alongside the other tabs below.

Click the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and specify
a `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
`Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} they sell the product for.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Specifying a vendor is essential for this workflow, because Odoo cannot
generate an `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
without knowing who the product is purchased from.
::::

If the product is manufactured, make sure it has a bill of materials
(BOM) configured for it. To do so, click the
`Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at
the top of the screen, then click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the `Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page to configure a new
`BOM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the
product.

::: seealso
For a full overview of `BOM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} creation, see the documentation on `bills of materials
<../../../manufacturing/basic_setup/bill_configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
:::

## Replenish using MTO

After configuring a product to use the
`MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} route, a
replenishment order is created for it every time an
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} including the
product is confirmed. The type of order created depends on the second
route selected in addition to `MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

For example, if *Buy* was the second route selected, then a
`PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is created upon
confirmation of an `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When the `MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} route is
enabled for a product, a replenishment order is always created upon
confirmation of an `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. This is the
case, even if there is enough stock of the product on-hand to fulfill
the `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, without buying or
manufacturing additional units of it.
::::

While the `MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} route can
be used in unison with the *Buy* or *Manufacture* routes, the *Buy*
route is used as the example for this workflow. Begin by navigating to
the `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, then click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which opens a blank quotation
form.

On the blank quotation form, add a `Customer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, click `Add a product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} under the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and enter a product configured to use the *MTO*
and *Buy* routes. Click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and the quotation is turned into an `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

A `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button now appears
at the top of the page. Clicking it opens the
`RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} associated
with the `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

After receiving approval from the vendor that they can meet the demand
by the `Expected
Arrival`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} date, click
`Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to turn it into a
`PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. A purple `Receive
Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button now appears above
the `PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Once the
products are received, click `Receive Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to open the receipt order, and click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to enter the products into
inventory.

Return to the `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by
clicking the `SO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} breadcrumb, or by
navigating to `Sales app --> Orders --> Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and selecting
the`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Finally, click the `Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button at the top of the order to open the delivery order. Once the
products have been shipped to the customer, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the delivery.

### Cancelling an SO with an MTO product

When a `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is cancelled,
and it had created an `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} or `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, the related delivery order is cancelled automatically.
However, the `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} or `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} themselves are **not** cancelled. Instead, a warning
appears in their chatter noting the `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} cancellation. These documents remain active, so the user
can either cancel them manually or repurpose the replenishment for
another order.

For information on workflows that include the
`MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} route, see the
following documentation:

--- SOURCE: inventory_and_mrp/inventory/warehouses_storage/replenishment/reordering_rules.md ---

# Reordering rules

*Reordering rules* are used to keep forecasted stock levels above a
certain threshold without exceeding a specified upper limit. This is
accomplished by specifying a minimum quantity that stock should not fall
below and a maximum quantity that stock should not exceed.

Reordering rules can be configured for each product based on the route
used to replenish it. If a product uses the *Buy* route, then a *request
for quotation* (RFQ) is created when the reordering rule is triggered.
If a product uses the *Manufacture* route, then a *manufacturing order*
(MO) is created instead. This is the case regardless of the selected
replenishment route.

::: seealso
\- [Odoo Tutorials: Automatic Reordering
Rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEJZrCjoXaU) - [Odoo Tutorials:
Manual Reordering Rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deIREJ1FFj4)
:::

To set up reordering rules for the first time, refer to:

- `Reordering rules setup <inventory/warehouses_storage/configure-rr>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Trigger <inventory/warehouses_storage/trigger>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Preferred route <inventory/warehouses_storage/route>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}

To understand and optimize replenishment using advanced features, see:

- `Just-in-time logic <inventory/warehouses_storage/just-in-time>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Visibility days <inventory/warehouses_storage/visibility-days>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Horizon days <inventory/warehouses_storage/horizon-days>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}

## Reordering rules setup {#inventory/warehouses_storage/configure-rr}

To configure automatic and manual reordering rules, complete the
following:

1.  `Product type configuration <inventory/warehouses_storage/set-product-type>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
2.  `Replenishment method <inventory/warehouses_storage/set-method>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
3.  `Create rule <inventory/warehouses_storage/rr-fields>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

### Product type configuration {#inventory/warehouses_storage/set-product-type}

A product must be configured correctly to use reordering rules. Begin by
navigating to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then select an existing product, or create a new
one by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

On the product form, under the `General Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, set the `Product Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to `Goods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and make
sure the `Track Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox
is ticked. This is necessary for Odoo to track the product\'s stock
levels and trigger reordering rules.

![Product Type and Track Inventory configurations.](reordering_rules/product-type.png)

### Replenishment method {#inventory/warehouses_storage/set-method}

Next, configure the replenishment method (e.g. buy or manufacture).

If the product is purchased,
`install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
**Purchase** app, and confirm that the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox is enabled under the product name. In the
`Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, add at least one
vendor to the
`vendor pricelist <../../../purchase/products/pricelist>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. Odoo uses the vendor at the top of the list to generate
`RFQs (Requests for Quotations)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} when
reordering rules are triggered.

In the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab\'s
`Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, tick the
`Buy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

::: seealso
`Vendor pricelist <../../../purchase/products/pricelist>`{.interpreted-text

:::

If the product is manufactured,
`install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
**Manufacturing** app, and in the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab\'s `Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, tick the `Manufacture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox.

Next, ensure at least one `bill of materials
<../../../manufacturing/basic_setup/bill_configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} (BoM) is displayed in the `Bill
of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the top
of the product form. This is necessary because Odoo only creates
manufacturing orders (MOs) for products with a
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

If a `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} does not
already exist for the product, click the
`Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button,
then click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to configure a new
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

### Create new reordering rules {#inventory/warehouses_storage/rr-fields}

To create a new reordering rule, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Operations -->
Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, then click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and fill out the following
fields for the new reordering rule line item:

- `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The product that is
  replenished by the rule.
- `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The location where the
  product is stored.
- `Min`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The minimum quantity that
  can be forecasted without the rule being triggered. When forecasted
  stock falls below this number, a replenishment order for the product
  is created.
- `Max`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The maximum quantity at
  which the stock is replenished.
- `Multiple Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the product
  should be ordered in specific quantities, enter the number that should
  be ordered. For example, if the `Multiple Quantity`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} is set to [5]{.title-ref}, and only 3 are needed, 5
  products are replenished.

### 0/0/1 reordering rule {#inventory/warehouses_storage/zero-zero}

The *0/0/1* reordering rule is a specialty rule used to replenish a
product that is not kept on-hand, each time a sales order (SO) is
confirmed for that product.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The 0/0/1 reordering rule is similar to the *Replenish on Order (MTO)*
route, in that both workflows are used to replenish a product upon
confirmation of an `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

The main difference between the two methods is that the *Replenish on
Order* route automatically reserves the product for the
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that caused it to be
replenished. This means the product **cannot** be used for a different
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

The 0/0/1 reordering rule does not have this limitation. A product
replenished using the rule is not reserved for any specific
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and can be used as
needed.

Another key difference is that replenishment orders created by the
*Replenish on Order* route are linked to the original
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by a smart button at
the top of the order. When using the 0/0/1 reordering rule, a
replenishment order is created, but is not linked to the original
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

See the `Replenish on Order (MTO) <mto>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation for a full overview of the MTO route.
::::

To create a 0/0/1 reordering rule, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Products -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select a product.

At the top of the product\'s page, click the
`fa-refresh`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Reordering Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button to
open the `Reordering Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page for
the product. On the resulting page, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to begin configuring a new reordering rule.

In the `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field of the new
reordering rule, select the location in which replenished products
should be stored. By default, this location is set to
`WH/Stock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In the `Route`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select the
route the rule should use to replenish the item. For example, if the
product should be purchased from a vendor, select the
`Buy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} route.

In the `Min`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field and
`Max`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, leave the values set to
[0.00]{.title-ref}. In the `To Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, enter a value of [1.00]{.title-ref}.

![A 0/0/1 reordering rule.](reordering_rules/001-rule.png)

With the reordering rule configured using these values, each time an
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} causes the forecasted
quantity of the product to fall below the `Min`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of [0.00]{.title-ref}, the selected
`Route`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is used to replenish the
product in one-unit increments, back up to the `Max`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of [0.00]{.title-ref}.

::: example
An item is configured with a 0/0/1 reordering rule that uses the *Buy*
route. Zero units are kept on-hand at any given time.

A `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is confirmed for one
unit, which causes the forecasted quantity to drop to
[-1.00]{.title-ref}. This triggers the reordering rule, which
automatically creates a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} for one unit.

Once the product is received from the vendor, the forecasted quantity
returns to [0.00]{.title-ref}. There is now one unit on-hand, but it is
not reserved for the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
which triggered its purchase. It can be used to fulfill that
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, or reserved for a
different order.
:::

## Trigger {#inventory/warehouses_storage/trigger}

A reordering rule\'s *trigger* can be set to *automatic* or *manual*.
While both function the same way, the difference between the two types
of reordering rules is how the rule is launched:

- `Auto <inventory/warehouses_storage/auto-rr>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: A purchase or manufacturing order is automatically
  created when the forecasted stock falls below the reordering rule\'s
  minimum quantity. By default, the `Auto`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} trigger is selected.
- `Manual <inventory/warehouses_storage/manual-rr>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: The `Replenishment report <report>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} lists products needing replenishment, showing
  current/forecasted stock, lead times, and arrival dates. Users can
  review forecasts before clicking *Order*.

To enable the `Trigger`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, go to
`Inventory app --> Operations -->
Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Then, click the
`oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(adjust settings)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, located to
the far-right of the column titles, and tick the
`Trigger`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

In the `Trigger`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, select
`Auto`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Manual`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Refer to the sections below to learn about the
different types of reordering rules.

### Auto {#inventory/warehouses_storage/auto-rr}

*Automatic reordering rules*, enabled by setting the reordering rule\'s
`Trigger`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
`Auto`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, generate purchase or
manufacturing orders when either:

1.  The scheduler runs, and the *Forecasted* quantity is below the
    minimum, or
2.  A `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is confirmed,
    and lowers the *Forecasted* quantity of the product below the
    minimum.

If the `Buy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} route is selected, then
an `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
generated. To view and manage
`RFQs (Requests for Quotations)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
navigate to
`Purchase app --> Orders --> Requests for Quotation`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

If the `Manufacture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} route is
selected, then an `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is generated. To view and manage
`MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

When no route is selected, Odoo selects the `Route`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} specified in the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of the product form.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The scheduler is set to run once a day, by default.

To manually trigger a reordering rule before the scheduler runs, ensure
`developer mode
<developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is enabled, and select
`Inventory app --> Operations --> Run
Scheduler`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Then, click the
purple `Run Scheduler`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
pop-up window that appears.

Be aware that this also triggers any other scheduled actions.
::::

::: example
The product, [Office Lamp]{.title-ref}, has an automatic reordering rule
set to trigger when the forecasted quantity falls below the
`Min Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of [5.00]{.title-ref}.
Since the current `Forecast`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
[55.00]{.title-ref}, the reordering rule is **not** triggered.

![Show automatic reordering rule from the Reordering Rule page.](reordering_rules/auto.png)
:::

### Manual {#inventory/warehouses_storage/manual-rr}

*Manual reordering rules*, configured by setting the reordering rule\'s
`Trigger`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
`Manual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, list a product on the
`replenishment dashboard <report>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} when
the forecasted quantity falls below a specified minimum. Products on
this dashboard are called *needs*, because they are needed to fulfill
upcoming `SOs (Sales Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, for which
the forecasted quantity is not enough.

The replenishment dashboard, accessible by navigating to
`Inventory app -->
Operations --> Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
considers order deadlines, forecasted stock levels, and lead times. It
displays needs **only** when it is time to reorder items, thanks to the
`To Reorder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter.

When a product appears on the replenishment dashboard, clicking the
`Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button generates the purchase
or manufacturing order with the specified amounts
`To Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Click the Order button on the replenishment dashboard to replenish stock.](reordering_rules/manual.png)

## Route {#inventory/warehouses_storage/route}

Odoo allows for multiple routes to be selected as replenishment methods
under the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on each
product form. For instance, it is possible to select both
`Buy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Manufacture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, indicating to Odoo
that the product can be bought or manufactured.

::: seealso
`Set route on product form <inventory/warehouses_storage/set-method>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
:::

Odoo also enables users to set a preferred route for a product\'s
reordering rule. This is the replenishment method (e.g., buying or
manufacturing) that the rule defaults to, if multiple are available.

To specify a preferred route, begin by navigating to
`Inventory app --> Operations
--> Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

By default, the `Route`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column is
hidden. To reveal it, select the `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(adjust settings)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon
to the far-right of the column titles, and ticking
`Route`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu that
appears.

Click inside of the column on the row of a reordering rule, and a
drop-down menu shows all available routes for that rule. Select one to
set it as the preferred route.

![Select a preferred route from the drop-down.](reordering_rules/select-preferred-route.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If multiple routes are enabled for a product but no preferred route is
set for its reordering rule, the product is reordered using the *Buy*
route, then *Manufacture*.
::::

### Advanced uses

Pairing `Route`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with one of the
following fields on the replenishment report unlocks advanced
configurations of reordering rules. Consider the following:

::: {#inventory/warehouses_storage/set-vendor}
- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: When the selected
  `Route`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is `Buy`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, setting the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field to one of the multiple vendors on the vendor
  pricelist indicates to Odoo that the vendor is automatically populated
  on `RFQs (Requests for Quotations)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  when a reordering rule triggers the creation of a purchase order.
:::

::: {#inventory/warehouses_storage/set-bom-field}
- `Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: When the
  `Route`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
  `Manufacture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and there are
  multiple `BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in
  use, specifying the desired
  `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in the
  replenishment report, draft manufacturing orders are created with this
  `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in use.
:::

::: {#inventory/warehouses_storage/procurement-grp}
- `Procurement Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This is a way
  to group related `POs (Purchase Orders)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} or `MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} that are tied to fulfilling a specific demand, like an
  `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or a project. It
  helps organize and track which orders are linked to a particular
  demand.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  Procurement groups link replenishment methods to demand, making smart
  buttons to appear --- similar to how smart buttons appear when using
  the `MTO route <mto>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

  ![Sales order (demand) with a smart button linking to the related
  purchase order (replenishment
  method).](reordering_rules/po-smartbutton.png){alt="Showing smart button to PO."}
  ::::

  In the context of reordering rules:

  - Reordering rules do not automatically assign a procurement group,
    which is why there are no smart buttons that link
    `SOs (Sales Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
    `POs (Purchase Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, unlike the
    `MTO (Make to Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} route.
  - To enable smart buttons for products replenished by reordering rules
    (not `MTO (Make to
    Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}), with specific quantities
    linked to specific demands (e.g.
    `SOs (Sales Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}), assign a
    procurement group.
  - Without a procurement group, demands for the same product can be
    combined into a single
    `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, even
    if the reordering rule is executed multiple times for those demands.
    This allows for more efficient procurement by consolidating demands
    into fewer orders.

  Selecting a procurement group in the
  `Procurement Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the
  replenishment report ensures that all linked orders are grouped under
  the same demand, based on the defined route.

  :::: exercise
  How can you set the *Procurement Group*, *Vendor*, and *Route* fields
  on the replenishment report to generate a single
  `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for five
  different products in sales order SO35, given they share the same
  vendor, Azure Interior, and ensure other demands for these products
  are handled separately?

  ::: spoiler
  View the answer

  1.  Set the `Procurement Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
      [SO35]{.title-ref}, in the reordering rule for all five products.
      This groups the demands for [SO35]{.title-ref} in the same
      `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
      `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
  2.  Set the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to [Azure
      Interior]{.title-ref} to ensure the
      `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
      created for the same supplier.
  3.  Set the `Route`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
      `Buy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to generate an
      `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
  4.  Click the `Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
      generate a single `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
      role="abbr"} for the five products tied to [SO35]{.title-ref}.

  | After placing the order, remove [SO35]{.title-ref} from the
    `Procurement Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field of the
    five products\' reordering rules. This ensures future demands for
    these products are managed separately and assigned to different
    `RFQs (Requests for Quotations)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} (the
    usual behavior).

## Just-in-time logic {#inventory/warehouses_storage/just-in-time}

*Just-in-time logic* in Odoo minimizes storage costs by placing orders
precisely to meet deadlines. This is achieved using the
`forecasted date <inventory/warehouses_storage/forecasted-date>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, which determines when replenishment is necessary to avoid
overstocking.

The forecasted date is the **earliest possible date** to receive a
product if the replenishment process starts immediately. It is
calculated by summing the lead times linked to the replenishment
process, such as
`vendor lead times <inventory/warehouses_storage/purchase-lt>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and
`purchasing delays <inventory/warehouses_storage/purchase-security-lt>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for purchases, or
`manufacturing lead times <inventory/warehouses_storage/manuf-lt>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for production. Both automatic and manual reordering rules
work this way.

::: example
For a product with a 5-day total lead time and a sales order delivery
date in 10 days, Odoo waits 5 days to place the order, ensuring it
arrives just in time for delivery.
:::

Important considerations:

- **If this feels risky**, consider adding buffer time or
  `adjusting lead times <lead_times>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} for
  more flexibility.
- While lead times and just-in-time logic provide additional control,
  **reordering rules work perfectly fine without them**. Keeping
  delivery dates on sales orders as their *creation date* ensures
  purchases are immediately triggered when needed

### Forecasted date and To Order quantity {#inventory/warehouses_storage/forecasted-date}

The *forecasted date* is the earliest receipt date for a product, if it
is ordered right now. It is calculated by summing the lead times linked
to the product\'s replenishment process. The total of these lead times,
added to the current date, determines when Odoo checks for demanded
stock.

To view the forecasted date go to the replenishment report and click the
`fa-info-circle`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(info)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon for the desired
reordering rule. The `Replenishment Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window displays the
`Forecasted Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and various lead
times.

::: example
A manual reordering rule is set up with no minimum or maximum
quantities.

- Vendor lead time is 4 days, the purchase security lead time is 1 day,
  and the days to purchase is 2 days.
- Today\'s date is November 26.
- These add up to 7 days, making the forecasted date, December 3rd.

A confirmed `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for 5
units has a delivery date of December 3rd (7 days from today). This
demand will appear on the replenishment report today, in the **To
Order** field.

However, if the delivery date were later than December 3rd, it would not
yet appear on the report. Odoo only displays quantities to replenish
when they fall within the forecasted date window, ensuring orders are
placed precisely when needed.

![Show forecasted date in Odoo.](reordering_rules/replenishment-info.png)
:::

The *just-in-time* logic ensures replenishment happens only when it\'s
necessary for the forecasted date\'s demand, helping avoid overstocking.

For example:

- If the forecasted quantity drops below the minimum **on** the
  forecasted date, replenishment must begin immediately to avoid
  shortages.
- If the quantity drops below the minimum **after** the forecasted date,
  replenishment can wait.

The **To Order** quantity is the total demand on the forecasted date.

By timing purchase orders based on the combined lead times, Odoo
optimizes stock levels, keeping inventory minimal while ensuring future
requirements are ordered at the last possible moment---strategic
procrastination without the stress!

### Common confusion about forecasted quantities

`SOs (Sales Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} due **after** the
`Forecasted Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are not accounted
for in the `Forecast`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} quantities of
the reordering rule.

They are, however, accounted for on the forecasted report that is opened
by clicking the `fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(graph)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon on the replenishment
report, as this one represents the **long-term forecasted quantity**.

::: example
![Continuing the above example, when the sales order\'s deadline is
adjusted to December 4th, the `Forecast`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `To Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
quantities are
zero.](reordering_rules/zero-forecast.png){alt="Forecast and To Order quantities is zero."}

![Opening the `Forecasted Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
shows the `Forecasted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} units is
[5.00]{.title-ref}.](reordering_rules/five-forecast.png){alt="Show forecasted report."}
:::

## Visibility days {#inventory/warehouses_storage/visibility-days}

*Visibility days* enable the ability to determine if additional
quantities should be added to the planned replenishment. Odoo checks if
forecasted stock on the forecasted date will drop below the minimum in
the reordering rule. **Only if** it is time to reorder, visibility days
check additional future demand by the specified number of days.

This feature helps consolidate orders by grouping immediate and
near-future needs, reducing transport costs and enabling supplier
discounts for larger orders.

To set visibility days to incorporate orders for a specified number of
days in the future, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Operations --> Replenishment`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, or by clicking the *Reordering Rules* smart
button from the product form.

Next, enable the `Visibility Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field by clicking the `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(adjust settings)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon
to the far right and choosing the feature from the drop-down menu. Then,
enter the desired visibility days.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The forecasted date is never pushed forward or extended; Odoo only
checks the extra visibility days if the stock falls below the minimum
threshold on the forecasted date.
::::

### Example where visibility days is triggered

A product shipped from Asia has a combined vendor lead time of 30 days
and a shipping cost of \$100 (including
`landed costs <../../product_management/inventory_valuation/landed_costs>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and tariffs).

- November 4: Current date. The forecasted date is December 4 (30 days
  later).
- `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 1: Requires the
  product by Dec 4. Odoo places the order today, costing \$100.
- `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 2: Requires the
  product by Dec 19. Normally, Odoo would order on Nov 19, costing an
  additional \$100.
- `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 3: Requires the
  product by Dec 25. Normally, Odoo would order on Nov 25, costing
  another \$100.

Ordering separately for these sales orders totals \$300 in shipping
costs.

![Show forecasted date visualization.](reordering_rules/forecasted-date.png)

Setting `Visibility Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
[20.0]{.title-ref} allows Odoo to \"look ahead\" 20 days from December 4
(`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 1\'s forecasted date)
to December 24.

- It groups `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 2\'s order
  with `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 1, reducing
  shipping costs by consolidating orders.
- `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 3, which is due on
  Dec 25, is one day late and is not grouped with the other two orders.

### Counterexample where visibility days is not triggered

Considering the example above, if `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} 1 does not exist, then:

- **November 4**: Current date. The forecasted date is December 4 (30
  days later).
- **November 5**: The forecasted date shifts to December 5.
- `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 2: Requires the
  product by December 19. Odoo will only trigger the order on November
  19, meaning the user will not see a replenishment notification until
  then.

This shows that visibility days complement just-in-time logic by
optimizing it to balance replenishment costs more effectively.

![Example where the visibility days does not trigger.](reordering_rules/counterexample.png)

## Horizon days

*Horizon days* determine how many days ahead Odoo checks if the
forecasted quantity will drop below reordering rule\'s minimum. The
feature is meant to help users plan replenishment in advance, by
increasing the
`forecasted date <inventory/warehouses_storage/forecasted-date>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

[$$\text{Forecasted date} = \text{Current date} + \text{Vendor Lead Time} + \text{Horizon Days}$$]{.overflow-scroll}

Since horizon days are only meant to be used with manual reordering
rules, find details about the feature in the
`Replenishment report article <report>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

# Replenishment report

The *replenishment report* is an interactive dashboard that uses
`manual reordering rules
<reordering_rules>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, lead times, and
upcoming demands to forecast quantities of products that need
restocking.

Reordering rules used on this dashboard are normal reordering rules, but
the user benefits from a monitoring menu with extra options to manage
suggestions for replenishment.

This enables users to anticipate future needs, keep less products on
hand without the risk of running out, plan and consolidate orders.

## Navigate the replenishment report

To access the replenishment report, go to
`Inventory app --> Operations -->
Replenishment.`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Automatic reordering rules are available on this menu as well, but are
hidden by default.
::::

The fields and features unique to the replenishment dashboard are
displayed below. For definitions of the other fields, go to the
`Create reordering rules section
<inventory/warehouses_storage/rr-fields>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

By default, the quantity in the `To Order`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field is the quantity required to reach the set
`Max Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. However, the
`To Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} quantity can be adjusted
by clicking on the field and changing the value. To replenish a product
manually, click `fa-truck`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Click `fa-bell-slash`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Snooze`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to temporarily deactivate
the reordering rule for the set period, hiding the entry from the
replenishment dashboard, when it is supposed to appear.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Defining a `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} allows filtering
or grouping demands by the vendor. This simplifies the process of
identifying products to order and can reduce shipment costs. Click the
`oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(adjust settings)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and select
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down list to
view the field on the report.
::::

![Replenishment report that displays recommended quantities to order.](report/replenishment-dashboard.png)

### Order to max

If a reordering rule does not forecast the product to arrive below the
minimum, the replenishment cannot be triggered, because it is seen as
*unnecessary*. However, there can be instances where a product needs to
be replenished even if it is not deemed *necessary*, such as when an
order needs to be maximized to obtain better discounts, or to save on
delivery costs.

First, select one or more products by ticking the appropriate checkbox.
Then, click the `Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
and select `Order to Max`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so
creates a request for quotation (RFQ) for the first possible
replenishment date for each product for the maximum specified in the
reordering rule.

![The Order to Max option on the replenishment dashboard.](report/order-to-max.png)

### Horizon days {#inventory/warehouses_storage/horizon-days}

*Horizon days* determine how many days ahead Odoo checks if the
forecasted quantity will drop below reordering rule\'s minimum. The
feature is meant to help users plan replenishment in advance, by
increasing the
`forecasted date <inventory/warehouses_storage/forecasted-date>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} on the `replenishment report <report>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

::: example
Setting horizon days to [7]{.title-ref} ensures all manual reordering
rules set to trigger within the next seven days appear on the
replenishment report, allowing users to review and decide which products
to order in advance.
:::

To set horizon days, go to
`Inventory app --> Operations --> Replenishment`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click
`fa-angle-double-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`fa-folder`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Manual`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the left sidebar. In the menu that appears, set the
number of `Horizon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} days.

Both horizon days and
`visibility days <inventory/warehouses_storage/visibility-days>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} allow Odoo to anticipate future demand, but they work
differently:

- **Visibility days**: only checks future demand if a replenishment
  would have been triggered today.
- **Horizon days**: looks ahead a specified number of days and triggers
  reordering rules as soon as the forecasted quantity falls below the
  minimum within that window --- even if no replenishment is needed
  today.

::: example
\- Current date: Feb 18 - On hand quantity: 10 - Reordering rule: Min:
5, Max 10 - Vendor lead time: 1 day

8 units are needed for an `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} on Feb 23. That means, on Feb 23, there will only be 2
units in stock.

**Without horizon days**

- The demand appears on the replenishment report only on Feb 22, one day
  before the delivery date.
- Forecasted date: Feb 19 (current date + vendor lead time)

**With horizon days (4 or more days)**

- Odoo considers demand up to Feb 23 as relevant today (Feb 18)
- The need for 8 more units appears immediately in the replenishment
  report
- Forecasted date: Feb 23 (current date + vendor lead time + horizon
  days)

![Show forecasted date brought forward.](report/horizon-days.png)
:::

## Replenishment information

In each line of the replenishment report, clicking the
`fa-info-circle`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(info)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon opens the
`Replenishment Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, which displays the *lead times* and *forecasted date*.

For detailed information on how to use this feature for replenishment,
go to the `Just in time
logic <inventory/warehouses_storage/just-in-time>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} section.

### Select a warehouse

If a warehouse\'s replenishment method is
`resupply from another warehouse
<resupply_warehouses>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, check for
available product quantities in other warehouses by opening the
`Replenishment Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window. Warehouses that can replenish the stock are listed under the
`Warehouses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and the
`Available Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} shows the
on-hand stock in each warehouse.

After selecting a sourcing warehouse, click
`Select Route`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is clicked, the
reordering rule will revert to its preferred route (Buy or Manufacture).

# Inter-warehouse replenishment

When a business operates multiple locations, such as warehouses, retail
shops, or manufacturing facilities, resupplying stock from a central
warehouse is sometimes necessary. Odoo uses a *Route* configuration that
enables locations to replenish from a central distribution center,
automatically generating *inter-warehouse transfers*. Odoo
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} manages these transfers
to keep stores in stock.

This guide explains how to conduct inter-warehouse transfers using two
replenishment strategies:

1.  `Make to order (MTO) <inventory/warehouses_storage/MTO>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
2.  `Reordering rule <inventory/warehouses_storage/reordering-rule>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

::: seealso
`Difference between MTO and reordering rules <../replenishment>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Configuration

The initial configuration for both replenishment strategies is the same.
First go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. In the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, activate `Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to apply the setting.

![Enable Storage Locations in Inventory settings.](resupply_warehouses/storage-locations.png){.align-center}

### Warehouses

Configure the settings for the central warehouse and connecting storage
locations by going to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Warehouses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Each central warehouse and other locations *must* have its own
warehouse. For example, each shop is considered a local warehouse.
::::

Select an existing warehouse, or create a new one to be resupplied from
the central warehouse, by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, give the warehouse a name and a
`Short Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which will appear on
that warehouse\'s transfers.

In the `Warehouse Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
locate the `Resupply From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
Check the box next to the central warehouse\'s name. If the warehouse
can be resupplied by more than one warehouse, make sure to check those
warehouses\' boxes too. Now, Odoo knows which warehouses can resupply
this warehouse.

::: example
The central warehouse that will supply the shops is called [Central
warehouse]{.title-ref}. The `Resupply From`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field is set to this warehouse on the shop\'s warehouse
configuration page.
:::

::: seealso
`../inventory_management/warehouses`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

![Supply one warehouse with another in the Warehouse Configuration tab.](resupply_warehouses/warehouse.png){.align-center}

### Set route on a product

Products must also be configured properly in order for them to be
transferred between warehouses.

Go to `Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the desired product.

In the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, the new route
appears as `X: Supply Product from Y`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
in the `Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, where \'X\'
is the store\'s warehouse that receives products, and \'Y\' is the
warehouse that sends products.

Tick the `X: Supply Product from Y`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox, which is intended to be used with the
`MTO (Make to Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} route or a
reordering rule to replenish stock by moving the product from one
warehouse to another. Proceed to the dedicated sections below to
continue the process.

#### MTO {#inventory/warehouses_storage/MTO}

To replenish products using the make-to-order method, go to the product
form and ensure the
`MTO route is unarchived <inventory/warehouses_storage/unarchive-mto>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, so it appears in the `Routes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section of the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.

With the resupply and `MTO (Make to Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} routes ticked, jump to the section titled:
`Replenish from another
warehouse <inventory/warehouses_storage/resupply-workflow>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

::: example
The product, sold at the warehouse, [Store]{.title-ref}, is resupplied
from the central warehouse, named [YourCompany]{.title-ref}. To
replenish the product using `MTO (Make to Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, the following routes are selected:

- `Store: Supply Product from YourCompany`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `Replenish on Order (MTO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

![Route setting which enables a product to resupplied from a second warehouse.](resupply_warehouses/resupply-route.png){.align-center}
:::

#### Reordering rule {#inventory/warehouses_storage/reordering-rule}

To replenish products using reordering rules, first ensure the
`X: Supply Product from Y`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} route is
selected in the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of
the product form.

Then, create a reordering rule to automate replenishment by clicking the
`Reordering
Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button.

Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and set:

- `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the stock location of
  the retail store. For example, [SHOP/Stock]{.title-ref}.
- `Route`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `X: Supply Product from Y`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Min Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Max Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to trigger automatic
  stock transfers when inventory falls below the set threshold.

::: seealso
`reordering_rules`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

::: example
A
`0/0 reordering rule <inventory/warehouses_storage/zero-zero>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to replenish the shop\'s warehouse is created, with the
`Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set to
[SHOP/Stock]{.title-ref}, and the `Route`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} set to
`Store: Resupply from YourCompany`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Show reordering rule configurations.](resupply_warehouses/reordering-rule.png){.align-center}
:::

## Replenish one warehouse from another {#inventory/warehouses_storage/resupply-workflow}

After completing the setup, trigger replenishment using one of several
methods, such as:

- Navigate to the product form of the product that is resupplied from
  another warehouse.

  Click the `Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
  top-left of the product page. In the pop-up window, set the warehouse
  to the retail shop, (e.g. [Store]{.title-ref}), and click
  `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  ![Replenish pop-up window on the product form.](resupply_warehouses/replenish.png){.align-center}

- Create a quotation, and in the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} tab, set the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to the retail shop (e.g. [Store]{.title-ref}), when
  selling the product makes the on-hand quantity of the product go below
  the minimum set on the reordering rule.

  ![Create a quote at the store.](resupply_warehouses/warehouse-field.png){.align-center}

Once triggered, Odoo creates two transfers: One is a *delivery order*
from the central, supplying warehouse, which contains all the necessary
products to the store, and the second is a *receipt* at the shop, from
the main warehouse.

While in transit, the product is located at [Physical
Locations/Inter-warehouse transit]{.title-ref}.

::: example
A sales order for the product at the shop is created. To replenish the
product at the shop and ship it from there, Odoo generates a delivery
order from the central warehouse\'s stock, [WH/Stock]{.title-ref} to the
shop\'s warehouse [SHOP/Stock]{.title-ref}. While the products are
traveling between warehouses, they are in [Physical
Locations/Inter-warehouse transit]{.title-ref}.

The final delivery order is from the shop to the customer\'s delivery
address, and is not pertinent to the workflow in this guide.

# Replenishment

In Odoo, stock can be replenished one of three ways: *reordering rules*,
the *make to order* (MTO) route, or using the *master production
schedule* (MPS).

Each replenishment mechanism triggers the creation or suggestion of a
purchase order (PO) or manufacturing order (MO), with the best choice
depending on the business process.

## Replenishment strategies

### Replenishment report and reordering rules

Reordering rules are rules that can be set up to maintain a minimum
stock level. They are often configured to support manufacturing or sales
requirements. When a product\'s stock falls at or below the minimum
level, Odoo generates (or suggests) a purchase or manufacturing order to
replenish stock to the maximum level.

When using automatic reordering rules, Odoo generates a new order. When
using manual, Odoo suggests orders on the replenishment report. For
detailed guidance, refer to the `replenishment report
<replenishment/report>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
`reordering rules <replenishment/reordering_rules>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

Key points include:

- `Automatic reordering rules <inventory/warehouses_storage/auto-rr>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: Automatically create
  `POs (Purchase Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
  `MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} when stock
  falls below the minimum level. While this is convenient, it is less
  flexible.
- `Manual reordering rules <inventory/warehouses_storage/manual-rr>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: Generate suggestions in the replenishment report for user
  review, allowing adjustments and batch orders while meeting deadlines.
- `Just-in-time logic <inventory/warehouses_storage/just-in-time>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: A strategy to replenish only what is needed to prevent
  overstocking.

::: seealso
\- `replenishment/reordering_rules`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} -
`replenishment/report`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

### Make to order {#inventory/management/products/strategies}

An `MTO (Make to Oder)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} strategy means
that procurement or production is triggered only after a sales order has
been confirmed. This strategy is recommended when products are
customizable, demand is unpredictable, there is limited storage
capacity, and when products are high in value and low in demand. In such
cases, it does not make sense to keep on-hand inventory.

Unlike products replenished using reordering rules, Odoo automatically
links the sales order to the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} or `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} generated by the `MTO (Make to Oder)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} route.

Another difference between reordering rules and
`MTO (Make to Oder)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is, with
`MTO (Make to Oder)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, Odoo generates a
draft `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} immediately
after the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
confirmed. With reordering rules, Odoo generates a draft
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} when the
product\'s forecasted stock falls below the set minimum quantity.

In addition, Odoo automatically adds quantities to the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} as the
forecast changes, so long as the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} or `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is not confirmed.

The `MTO (Make to Oder)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} route is the
best replenishment strategy for products that are customized, and/or for
products that have no stock kept on-hand.

::: seealso
`replenishment/mto`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

### Master production schedule

The `MPS (Master Production Schedule)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
a dashboard where products and their forecasted quantities are entered.
Based on confirmed manufacturing and purchase orders, the dashboard
recommends amounts to order or produce.

This a useful **manual** tool for keeping track of quantities. The
`MPS (Master Production
Schedule)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} **should absolutely not** be
used alongside reordering rules, as the automated workflow disrupts its
manual replenishment method.

# Stock valuation dashboard

When a company has physical assets, such as inventory, they often want
to know approximately how much has been spent on these goods, or how
much they are worth at the moment. This process of assigning a monetary
value to account for inventory is known as *stock valuation*.

This value is often reported for accounting purposes. For instance, an
insurance company may want to know the value of goods stored in a
warehouse, in the event of a flood or fire.

`Stock valuation <../../product_management/inventory_valuation/using_inventory_valuation>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} typically utilizes one of two accounting systems:

- **Perpetual**: The inventory is constantly (perpetually) being
  updated, and the value is constantly changing.
- **Periodic**: The inventory value is checked on an occasional
  (periodic) basis, and the value is set at this occasional time.

Using
`tracked inventory <inventory/product_management/tracking-inventory>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} in Odoo necessitates a *perpetual* inventory accounting
system because of the need to know when and where inventory exists, and
how much of it is available or forecasted. There are a few common `stock
valuation methods <inventory/warehouses_storage/costing_methods>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} used in Odoo: *standard price*, *average cost* (AVCO), and
*first in, first out* (FIFO) accounting. It is important to know that
the valuation method chosen for a product impacts the calculation of
several fields in the stock valuation reports.

## Open the dashboard

Odoo\'s *Stock Valuation* dashboard displays the financial value of all
tracked inventory, according to each product\'s stock valuation method.
This report can provide insights into potential issues in the supply
chain, such as sunken purchase costs or delays in profitability. To
access the dashboard, go to
`Inventory app --> Reporting --> Valuation`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Reporting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} menu in
**Inventory** is only accessible to users with
`admin access <../../../../general/users/access_rights>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
::::

This dashboard has three different views, or inventory reports ---
`list view
<inventory/warehouses_storage/valuation-report>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (i.e. the default stock valuation report),
`pivot view <inventory/warehouses_storage/aging-report>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (i.e. the stock aging report), and
`graph view <inventory/warehouses_storage/graph-view>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Each view can be customized with different fields to break
down inventory valuation by product, operation type, date, or company.

All three views can be filtered by various fields. To apply filters,
click into the search bar at the top of the report, or click the
drop-down arrow next to it. For example, selecting the filter
`Has Remaining Qty`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} will show only
products that are currently in stock.

## List view: stock valuation {#inventory/warehouses_storage/valuation-report}

By default, the `Stock Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
dashboard displays in *list view*, represented by the
`oi-view-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(list)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon. This report shows a detailed record of stock
movements and their valuations.

### Configure

The following columns are displayed by default:

- `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date and time when the
  `stock move <inventory/warehouses_storage/svl>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} was created. The valuation report is sorted by this field
  by default, emphasizing the importance of time when valuing inventory.
  To sort the report by a different column, simply click on the column
  title.
- `Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the reference document
  associated with this stock move (e.g., a warehouse receipt, a delivery
  order, or a manual inventory adjustment).
- `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the product that is
  being moved and valued.
- `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the number of units by
  which this product\'s stock has increased or decreased in this
  particular stock move.
- `Total Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the value of the
  product\'s stock in this particular stock move, calculated by
  multiplying the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Unit Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If a `Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} document includes
several goods, there will be a separate line item generated on the
report for each good.
::::

There are additional fields that can be added to this view to provide
more insight into the stock\'s valuation. To add fields, click the
`oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(adjust)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, and select the
desired fields:

- `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the uniquely
  identifying lot or serial number for this product.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: for businesses that
  operate with multiple companies, this field displays the company by
  which this stock move took place.
- `Remaining Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the number of
  units remaining for this valuation of the product, after demand has
  been accounted for (even from other stock moves). This field can be
  especially helpful for `FIFO (First In, First Out)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} and `AVCO (Average Cost)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  accounting, as it conveys which units of stock came into a warehouse
  first and the value of said stock.
- `Unit Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the cost of one unit
  of the product for the company (**not** the price to consumers).
- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a description of the
  reason for this stock valuation (typically, a stock move has
  occurred). By default, this field is set as the concatenation of the
  `Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields. However, the
  field may also display other important messages for this line item,
  such as a note stating that the line item is an adjustment due to a
  change in the product\'s inventory valuation method.
- `Remaining Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the value of
  this product\'s current stock levels for this particular stock move,
  after demand has been accounted for. Along with
  `Remaining Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, this field
  can be especially helpful for
  `FIFO (First In, First Out)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
  `AVCO (Average Cost)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} accounting, as
  they convey which stock came into a warehouse first and the value of
  said stock.

### Stock valuation layers (SVLs) {#inventory/warehouses_storage/svl}

Each line item in the `Stock Valuation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} report represents a record in Odoo\'s system known as a
*stock valuation layer (SVL)*.
`SVLs (stock move layers)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are generated
when products move in a way that impacts their stock valuation.
Specifically, the stock moves that generate
`SVLs (stock move layers)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are warehouse
receipts, deliveries, dropshipping orders, and dropshipping returns.
These stock moves must first be validated (by clicking the
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button) for the
`SVL (stock move layer)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to be created.

If a product\'s inventory valuation method changes on the product form,
new line items are generated on the `Stock Valuation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} report to reflect the resulting
`SVLs (stock move layers)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. For example,
if the valuation method changes from *standard price* to either
`AVCO (Average
Cost)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`FIFO (First In, First Out)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} accounting,
*revaluation entries* will be automatically posted to reflect the change
in pricing for goods that remain in stock. One entry will be negative to
\"remove\" the old pricing, and the second entry will be positive to
record the new pricing. These entries are connected to journal entries
in Odoo\'s **Accounting** app.

Below is an example of what the `Stock Valuation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} table shows when a few stock moves have occurred for a
product using standard price accounting.

![Stock valuation table in standard price accounting.](aging/before-val-method-change.png)

Conversely, the following image depicts what the *Stock Valuation*
Report table might look like after a product has switched from standard
price to `FIFO (First In, First Out)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
accounting.

![Stock valuation table after switching from standard price to FIFO accounting.](aging/after-val-method-change.png)

::: example
The `Remaining Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Remaining Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields are
derived from what occurs at the
`SVL (stock move layer)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} level in Odoo
and, as such, are better understood with an example.

Frankie\'s Consignment Shop buys sweaters at the cost, or
`Unit Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, of [5.00]{.title-ref}
dollars. For the first time, Frankie\'s purchases and receives a
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of [100.00]{.title-ref}
sweaters in one stock move, then re-sells and delivers
[-10.00]{.title-ref} sweaters in a second stock move.

In the first stock move line item, the
`Remaining Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} will change from
[100.00]{.title-ref} to [90.00]{.title-ref}, once the second stock move
is recorded. This change reflects that, although 100 sweaters were
originally purchased, only 90 of those sweaters remain in stock and
should be counted in the valuation. Similarly, the
`Remaining Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} will drop from
[\$500.00]{.title-ref} to [\$450.00]{.title-ref}. The
`Total Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} will remain at
[\$500.00]{.title-ref}, regardless of subsequent transactions.

On the other hand, the `Remaining Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of the second stock move line item will be recorded and
remain at [0.00]{.title-ref} because the quantity of
[-10.00]{.title-ref} was sold. In the system, because the
`SVL (stock move layer)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} was a sale,
there is no stock left that needs to be valued from that transaction.

![Remaining value and quantity are calculated based on :abbr:\`SVLs (stock move layers)\`.](aging/remaining-val-quant.png)
:::

### Change the valuation date

To see the valuation of stock moves at a specific date and time, click
the `Valuation At
Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, located in the top-left
corner of the `Stock Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.
The report will show the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Total Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of each stock move.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Remaining Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Remaining Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the stock moves
will *not* be point-in-time for any dates chosen in the past. The stock
moves shown when selecting a past date will still display the *current
on-hand quantity and value* of the products.
::::

::: example
A business has 100 sofas in stock on January 1st and sells 20 of those
sofas on February 1st. The `Remaining Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of the `SVL (stock move layer)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} will drop from [100.00]{.title-ref} to [80.00]{.title-ref}
on February 1st. If no other stock moves take place, and on February
1st, the `Valuation at Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
selected as January 1st, the `Remaining Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} will still show as [80.00]{.title-ref}.
:::

## Pivot view: stock aging {#inventory/warehouses_storage/aging-report}

From the `Stock Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard,
access pivot view by clicking the `oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon. This
view is essentially a *stock aging report*, and it shows the on-hand
quantity and value of inventory by purchase date, which can help monitor
products with expiration dates.

### Configure

By default, the pivot view shows the value of all *product categories*
by *day and month*. Clicking the `fa-plus-square`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(plus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in each
column or row will reveal a drop-down list of options to create a more
granular breakdown of the inventory valuation. The drop-down options
include: `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Company`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Add Custom Group`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} Clicking the `fa-minus-square-o`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(minus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon collapses
the field back to an empty state.

In the table, the `Remaining Qty`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column displays the number of on-hand items, and
`Remaining Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} displays the total
cost of purchasing these items.

![Stock aging report, showing product row items and day columns.](aging/stock-aging-report.png)

## Graph view {#inventory/warehouses_storage/graph-view}

The stock value can be depicted graphically by clicking the
`fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(graph)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon. By default, the graph
is displayed in `fa-line-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} line
chart view and filtered to show the cumulative total of all inventory
value over time in Odoo.

At the top of the report, a `fa-bar-chart`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} bar chart or `fa-pie-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
pie chart view can be selected instead.

# Forecasted report

The **Inventory** *forecasted report* provides a real-time view of
projected stock levels, helping businesses manage their inventory
efficiently. This report is beneficial for planning and decision making,
ensuring stock availability for upcoming sales, manufacturing, and
replenishment activities.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The forecast report is **only** available on products where inventory is
being tracked, commonly referred to as a *storable product*.
::::

## Navigating the forecast report

The forecast report can be accessed via the **Inventory**, **Purchase**,
**Manufacturing**, and **Sales** apps.

To access the report, click the `fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Forecasted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button on a product form. Alternatively, the report can be accessed from
a sales order (SO) or purchase order (PO) by clicking on the
`fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Graph)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon next to the product,
then selecting `oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`View Forecast`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![A sales order with the forecast report icon highlighted.](forecast/so-forecast.png)

The forecasted report consists of a graph and a table. The graph
visually represents stock movements over time. The following information
is displayed:

- `On Hand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: current stock physically
  available in the warehouse.
- `Incoming`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: quantities expected
  from confirmed purchase orders or manufacturing orders.
- `Outgoing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: quantities reserved for
  sales orders or other outgoing operations.
- `Forecasted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: projected stock
  levels based on confirmed and planned operations.

![An example of the chart on a forecast report.](forecast/forecast-chart.png)

The table provides detailed metrics regarding operations, including:

- `Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Shows reserved
  quantities, especially useful for multi-step operations.
- `Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The date of receipt for
  the items.
- `Units`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The number of units
  involved in each operation.
- `Used by`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The operation the stock
  is allocated for.
- `Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The scheduled or
  expected date of stock movement.
- `Forecasted Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The
  forecasted stock levels.
- `Forecasted with Pending`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The
  updated stock levels with the pending stock movements considered.

### Reserve and unreserve products

Users can reserve or unreserve products directly from the forecasted
report, ensuring stock allocation aligns with operational needs.

![The detailed section on a forecast report showing the replenishment and reserved stock.](forecast/forecast-table.png)

::: seealso
`../../shipping_receiving/reservation_methods`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

### Replenish products

Click the `Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the
top of the report to open the `Product
Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up. From here,
products can be replenished through purchase orders from vendors, or
manufactured. Select the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Preferred Route`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, before clicking
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Manufacturing forecast

To view the availability of manufactured products, click the
`Manufacturing Forecast`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. This
displays the forecasted stock levels for raw materials, showing how much
are expected to be consumed for upcoming manufacturing orders.

The manufacturing forecast identifies component shortages before they
can impact manufacturing timelines, and helps to align manufacturing
activities with sales demands.

![An example of the manufacturing forecast report.](forecast/manufacturing-forecast.png)

### Update quantity

To manually update the quantity of a product, click
`Update Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This opens the
`Change Product Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up.
Confirm the correct product variant is selected in the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, then enter the
appropriate value in the `New Quantity on Hand`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. Click `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
when finished. The report then updates to reflect the new product
quantity.

## Multi-step reservation

Reserved quantities for multi-step incoming and outgoing shipments are
indicated on in the `Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column on the table of the report.

`Stock in Transit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} refers to products
that have been received, but are in transit to their input or quality
control locations. `Free Stock in Transit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} refers to available products received in the input
location, but not yet placed in stock.

## Operations affecting the forecast report

The forecast report is influenced by various operations, each impacting
stock levels differently. Scheduled delivery dates, planned
manufacturing dates, and expected arrival dates all affect the forecast
of inventory.

Requests for Quotation (RFQs) do not immediately impact the forecast
report, as the products are not confirmed for replenishment.
`POs (purchase orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, however, do
affect the report as the products are expected to arrive after the
`PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} has been confirmed.

Confirmed `SOs (sales orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} decrease
the forecasted stock, adjusting the report based on the scheduled
delivery date. Confirmed manufacturing orders (MOs) affect the
forecasted stock for both raw materials and finished goods.

## Use cases

### Negative quantity

A negative forecasted quantity indicates that the projected demand
exceeds the available and incoming stock at a given point in time. This
could occur because the `SOs (sales orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} or `MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} require more stock than is currently available or expected,
or because of delays in the shipping or manufacturing process.

Whatever the cause, when negative numbers are displayed on the forecast
report, it serves as an early warning, allowing business to take
preventative action. This can include:

- Prioritizing specific sales or production orders.
- Adjusting procurement strategies to expedite purchase orders.
- Manage customer expectations by proactively communicating the
  possibility for delays.

![An example of the forecast report with a negative quantity.](forecast/neg-quantity.png)

### Split orders

In the example below, there is not currently enough stock of a product,
[Cabinet with Doors]{.title-ref} to fulfill the multiple sales orders.
The current stock has been reserved for a shipment,
[WH/OUT/00011]{.title-ref}, and the remainder has been split between the
two orders. The remaining stock is expected with
[WH/IN/00004]{.title-ref}. Once received, they are the separated out to
cover the remaining orders.

![An example of the forecast report chart showing the split delivery for an order.](forecast/forecast-use-case.png)

### Late receipt

The replenishment table can be used to determine whether an incoming
shipment arrives in time to fulfill an order. For example, a
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is displayed with a
`Delivery Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for today for five
[Cable Management Boxes]{.title-ref}. The current on hand quantity is
zero. A `PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} has been
confirmed, with the expected arrival three days from today.

The forecasted quantity for today shows [-5]{.title-ref}, because the
confirmed demand is five, but the current stock on hand is zero. Since
the `Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} date is *after* the
`Delivery Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the shipment is
late.

This can be an indication to either expedite the current shipment, if
possible, or reschedule the delivery date for the
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

# Locations dashboard

The *Locations* dashboard in the **Inventory** application provides an
overview of on-hand storage locations for company products. Use this
report to see where stock is stored, identify
`misplaced items <inventory/warehouse_storage/stranded>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, or view past inventory to see product locations on specific
dates.

To access the locations report, the *Storage Locations* feature must be
enabled. To do that, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. In the `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, tick the checkbox for
`Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click

## Navigate the locations dashboard {#inventory/warehouses_storage/locations-report}

By default, the `Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard
lists all on-hand products in stock (in the `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column), along with the following information:

- `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: current storage
  location. If a product is stored at [Shelf 1]{.title-ref} and [Shelf
  2]{.title-ref}, the product is listed twice, showing quantities at
  each location.
- `Package`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the package that the
  product is stored in, if any.
- `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the product
  has a lot or serial number, it is specified here.
- `On Hand Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: current
  quantity of products. Click the `fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} `(edit)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to
  `modify the on-hand quantity
  <../inventory_management/count_products>`{.interpreted-text

## Generate reports

After learning how to `navigate the locations dashboard
<inventory/warehouses_storage/locations-report>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, it can be used to create and share different reports.

A few common reports that can be created using the
`Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard are detailed
below.

### Dead stock report

To get list of expired items, also referred to as *dead stock*, follow
these steps:

1.  Go to `Inventory app --> Reporting --> Locations`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
2.  Then, click into the search bar to reveal a drop-down list of
    `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
    `Favorite`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options.
3.  Enable the `Internal Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    and `Expiration Alerts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option
    under the `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

The report now displays a list of expired products.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This report can also be generated from the `Lot and Serials Numbers
<inventory/product_management/expiration-alerts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} page, accessed by going to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

![Show a list of products whose expiration dates have exceeded today.](locations/dead-stock.png)

### Stranded inventory report {#inventory/warehouse_storage/stranded}

Businesses using multi-step flows in the **Inventory** or
**Manufacturing** apps, may have *stranded* items, which are products
not in their proper storage locations, due to human error. Use this
report to periodically check transfer locations (e.g. *WH/Input*,
*WH/Pre-Processing*) to ensure items are moved to their intended storage
locations, and accurately recorded in the database.

To get a list of items that might be sitting idly in storage, follow
these steps:

1.  Go to `Inventory app --> Reporting --> Locations`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.

2.  In the search bar, begin typing the name of the location where
    products are intended to be moved to, such as
    [WH/Input]{.title-ref}, or [WH/Packing]{.title-ref}.

3.  Select the `Search Location for:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    \[location name\] option from the resulting drop-down menu that
    appears beneath the search bar.

    ![Show search result for the location.](locations/search-input-location.png)

The report now displays a list of products at the transit location.

::: example
Searching [Input]{.title-ref} in `Location`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} shows a list of products at a *WH/Input* location.

The list shows [500]{.title-ref} quantities of [Chicken]{.title-ref},
which is alarming if not refrigerated soon after reception. The stranded
inventory report helps identify items that have been idling in
non-storage locations.

![Show items stored at a specific location.](locations/stranded-inventory.png)
:::

### Inventory discrepancy report

To generate a report of items that have been moved since the last
`inventory audit
<../inventory_management/cycle_counts>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"},
follow these steps:

1.  Go to `Inventory app --> Reporting --> Locations`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.

2.  Then, click into the search bar to reveal a drop-down list of
    `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
    `Favorite`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options.

3.  Enable the `Internal Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    and `Conflicts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option from the
    `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

4.  The report now displays items whose quantities have changed since
    the last cycle count.

    ![Show items from the \*Conflicts\* filter in the report.](locations/discrepancy.png)

5.  Click the `fa-history`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}

# Add new equipment

::: {#maintenance/equipment_management/add_new_equipment}
In Odoo, *equipment* refers to any item that is used in everyday
operations, including the manufacturing of products. This can mean a
piece of machinery on a production line, a tool that is used in
different locations, or a computer in an office space. Equipment
registered in Odoo can be owned by the company that uses the Odoo
database, or by a third party, such as a vendor in the case of equipment
rentals.
:::

Using Odoo *Maintenance*, it is possible to track individual pieces of
equipment, along with information about their maintenance requirements.
To add a new piece of equipment, navigate to the
`Maintenance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} module, select
`Equipments --> Machines & Tools --> Create`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and configure the equipment as follows:

- `Equipment Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the product name
  of the piece of equipment
- `Equipment Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the category
  that the equipment belongs to; for example, computers, machinery,
  tools, etc.; new categories can be created by navigating to
  `Configuration --> Equipment Categories`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"} and clicking `Create`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the company that owns
  the equipment; again, this can be the company that uses the Odoo
  database, or a third-party company
- `Used By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: specify if the equipment
  is used by a specific employee, department, or both; select
  `Other`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to specify both an employee
  and a department
- `Maintenance Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the team
  responsible for servicing the equipment; new teams can be created by
  navigating to `Configuration --> Maintenance Teams`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"} and selecting `Create`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}; the members of each team can also be assigned from
  this page
- `Technician`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the person
  responsible for servicing the equipment; this can be used to assign a
  specific individual in the event that no maintenance team is assigned
  or when a specific member of the assigned team should always be
  responsible for the equipment; any person added to Odoo as a user can
  be assigned as a technician
- `Used in location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the location
  where the equipment is used; this is a simple text field that can be
  used to specify locations that are not work centers, like an office,
  for example
- `Work Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the equipment is
  used at a work center, specify it here; equipment can also be assigned
  to a work center by navigating to `Maintenance --> Equipments -->
  Work Centers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, selecting a
  work center or creating a new one using the `Create`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} button, and clicking the
  `Equipment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on the work center
  form

![An example of a fully configured new equipment form.](add_new_equipment/new-equipment-form.png){.align-center}

## Include additional product information

The `Product Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab at the
bottom of the page can be used to provide further details about the
piece of equipment:

- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the vendor that the
  equipment was purchased from
- `Vendor Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the reference
  code assigned to the vendor
- `Model`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the specific model of the
  piece of equipment
- `Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the unique serial
  number of the equipment
- `Effective Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date that the
  equipment became available for use; this is used to calculate the
  `MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
- `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the amount the equipment
  was purchased for
- `Warranty Expiration Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  date on which the equipment\'s warranty will expire

![The product information tab for the new piece of equipment.](add_new_equipment/new-equipment-product-information.png){.align-center}

## Add maintenance details

The `Maintenance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab at the bottom
of the page provides information about the failure frequency of the
piece of equipment:

- `Expected Mean Time Between Failure`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: the average number of days the equipment is expected
  to operate between failures. This number can be configured manually.
- `Mean Time Between Failure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  average number of days the equipment operates between failures. This
  number is calculated automatically based on previous failures, and
  cannot be configured manually.
- `Estimated Next Failure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  estimated date the equipment may experience its next failure. This
  date is calculated automatically based on the data in the
  `Mean Time Between
  Failure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Latest Failure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields, and cannot
  be configured manually.
- `Latest Failure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the most recent
  date on which the equipment failed. This date is based on the creation
  date of the equipment\'s most recent maintenance request, and cannot
  be configured manually.
- `Mean Time To Repair`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the average
  number of days needed to repair the equipment. This number is
  calculated automatically based on the duration of previous maintenance
  requests, and cannot be configured manually.

# Maintenance calendar

Avoiding equipment breakdowns, and blocks in warehouse work centers,
requires constant equipment maintenance. Timely corrective maintenance
for machines and tools that break unexpectedly, as well as preventive
maintenance to ensure that such issues are avoided, are key to keeping
warehouse operations running smoothly.

In Odoo *Maintenance*, users can access the *Maintenance Calendar* to
create, schedule, and edit both corrective and preventive maintenance
requests, to stay on top of equipment and work centers.

## Create maintenance request

Maintenance requests can be created directly from the *Maintenance
Calendar*. To access the calendar, navigate to
`Maintenance app --> Maintenance --> Maintenance Calendar`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

To create a new request, click anywhere on the calendar. Doing so opens
a `New Event`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window. In the
`Name:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, assign a title to the
new request.

![New event creation pop-up window.](maintenance_calendar/maintenance-calendar-new-event-popup.png){.align-center}

Clicking `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the pop-up
window saves the new request with no additional details. If the
request\'s creation should be cancelled, click
`Cancel`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To add more details and schedule the request for a specific date and
time, click `Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Clicking `Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} opens a blank
maintenance request form, where various details about the request can be
filled out.

### Edit maintenance request

In the `Request`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, assign a
title to the new request. In the `Created By`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, from the drop-down menu, select which user the
request was created by. By default, this field populates with the user
actually creating the request.

![New maintenance request form creation.](maintenance_calendar/maintenance-calendar-new-request-form.png){.align-center}

In the `For`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, from the
drop-down menu, select if this request is being created for a piece of
`Equipment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or a
`Work Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If `Work Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected in the
`For`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field\'s drop-down menu, two
additional fields appear on the form: `Work Center`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Block Workcenter`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

In the `Work Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select
which work center in the warehouse this maintenance request applies to.

If the `Block Workcenter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option\'s
checkbox is ticked, it is not possible to plan work orders, or other
maintenance requests, in this work center during the time that this
request is being performed.
::::

If `Equipment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected in the
`For`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, which it is by default,
select which machine or tool requires maintenance from the
`Equipment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Once a specific
piece of equipment is selected, a greyed-out
`Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears, listing the
*Equipment Category* to which the equipment belongs.

In the `Worksheet Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, if
necessary, click the drop-down menu to select a worksheet template.
These templates are custom templates that can be filled out by the
employee performing the maintenance.

Under the `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, the
`Request Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field displays the
date requested for the maintenance to happen.

The `Maintenance Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field provides
two selectable radio button options: `Corrective`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Preventive`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

`Corrective`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} maintenance is for
requests that arise for immediate needs, such as broken equipment, while
`Preventive`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} maintenance is for
planned requests, to avoid breakdowns in the future.

If this request is tied to a specific
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, select that
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} from the
`Manufacturing
Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

From the drop-down menu for the `Team`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, select the desired maintenance team who will
perform the maintenance. In the `Responsible`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, select the technician responsible for the
request.

![Filled-out details of maintenance request form.](maintenance_calendar/maintenance-calendar-filled-out-form.png){.align-center}

In the `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, click
the date to open a calendar popover. From this popover, select the
planned date of the maintenance, and click `Apply`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to save the date.

In the `Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, enter the
the amount of hours (in a [00:00]{.title-ref} format) that the
maintenance is planned to take.

In the `Priority`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, choose a
priority between one and three `⭐⭐⭐ (stars)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. This indicates the importance of the maintenance
request.

If working in a multi-company environment, from the drop-down menu in
the `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select the
company to which this maintenance request belongs.

At the bottom of the form, there are two tabs: `Notes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In the `Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, type out any
internal notes for the team or technician assigned to the request, if
necessary.

In the `Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, if
necessary, select one of the three radio button options to provide
maintenance instructions to the assigned team or technician. The
available methods for providing instructions are via
`PDF`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Google Slide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Text`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Instructions tab options on maintenance request form.](maintenance_calendar/maintenance-calendar-instructions-tab.png){.align-center}

## Calendar elements

From this pop-up window, configure the properties of the new rule for
the filter. Once ready, click `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

The right-hand side of the drop-down menu lists the
`Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or any searches that
have been saved as a favorite to be revisited at a later date.

![Favorites section of filters drop-down menu.](maintenance_calendar/maintenance-calendar-favorites-popover.png){.align-center}

To save a new `Favorite`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} search,
select the desired `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then,
click `Save current search`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In the
field directly below `Save current search`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, assign a name to the search.

Under the assigned name, there are two options, to save the current
search either as the `Default filter`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or as a `Shared`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
filter.

Selecting `Default filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sets this
filter as the default when opening this calendar view.

Selecting the `Shared`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter makes
this filter available to other users.

Once ready, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. When
clicked, the new `Favorite`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter
appears in the `Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column,
and a `⭐ (gold star)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon appears
with the filter\'s name in the search bar.

### Views

The `Maintenance Calendar`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
available in six different views: `Calendar`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} (default), `Kanban`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`List`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Pivot`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Graph`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Activity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Different view type icons for maintenance calendar.](maintenance_calendar/maintenance-calendar-view-type-icons.png){.align-center}

#### Calendar view

`Calendar`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is the default view
displayed when the `Maintenance Calendar`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is opened. There are a number of options in this view
type for sorting and grouping information about maintenance requests.

In the top-left corner of the page, there is a drop-down menu set to
`Week`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, by default. Clicking that
drop-down menu reveals the different periods of time, in which the
calendar can be viewed: `Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and `Year`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. There is also an option to
`Show weekends`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, selected by default.
If unselected, weekends are not shown on the calendar.

![Calendar period drop-down menu options.](maintenance_calendar/maintenance-calendar-period-dropdown.png){.align-center}

To the left of this menu, there is a `⬅️ (left arrow)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon and a `➡️ (right
arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon. Clicking these arrows
moves the calendar backward or forward in time, respectively.

To the right of the drop-down menu set to `Week`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, by default, is a `Today`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. Clicking this button resets the calendar to
view today\'s date, no matter which point in time is being viewed before
clicking it.

- `Request Confirmed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: when this box
  is not ticked, and the maintenance request type is set to *Work
  Center*, no leave is created for the respective work center when a
  maintenance request is created. If the box *is* ticked, the work
  center is automatically blocked for the listed duration, either at the
  specified date, or as soon as possible, if the work center is
  unavailable.
- `Sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the order in the
  maintenance process, in which this stage appears.
- `Request Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if ticked, this box
  indicates this stage is the final step of the maintenance process.
  Requests moved to this stage are closed.

Once ready, click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If
no changes have been made, click `Discard`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or click the `X`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon to close the pop-up window.

# Maintenance requests

In order to keep equipment and work centers functioning properly, it is
often necessary to perform maintenance on them. This can include
preventive maintenance, intended to prevent equipment from breaking
down, or corrective maintenance, which is used to fix equipment that is
broken or otherwise unusable.

In Odoo *Maintenance*, users can create *maintenance requests* to
schedule and track the progress of equipment and work center
maintenance.

## Create maintenance request

To create a new maintenance request, navigate to
`Maintenance app --> Maintenance -->
Maintenance Requests`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Begin filling out the form by entering a descriptive title in the
`Request`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field (e.g., [Drill not
working]{.title-ref}).

The `Created By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field auto-populates
with the user creating the request, but a different user can be selected
by clicking on the drop-down menu.

In the `For`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu, select
`Equipment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if the maintenance
request is being created for a piece of equipment, or
`Work Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if it is being created
for a work center.

Depending on the option selected in the `For`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, the next field is titled either
`Equipment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Work Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Using the drop-down
menu for either field, select a piece of equipment or a work center.

If the *Custom Maintenance Worksheets* setting is enabled in the
*Maintenance* app\'s settings, a `Worksheet Template`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field appears below the `Equipment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Work
Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. If necessary, use this
field to select a worksheet to be filled out by the employee performing
the maintenance.

The next field is titled `Request Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and is set by default to the date on which the
maintenance request is created. This date cannot be changed by the user.

In the `Maintenance Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
select the `Corrective`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option if the
request is intended to fix an existing issue, or the
`Preventive`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option if the request is
intended to prevent issues from occurring in the future.

If the request is being created to address an issue that arose during a
specific manufacturing order (MO), select it in the
`Manufacturing Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

If an `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} was
selected in the `Manufacturing Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, a `Work Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears
below it. If the issue arose during a specific work order, specify it in
this field.

In the `Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select the
maintenance team that is responsible for managing the request. If a
specific team member is responsible, select them in the
`Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

The `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is used to
specify the date on which maintenance should take place, and the time it
should begin. Choose a date by clicking on the field to open a calendar
in a pop-up window, and then select a day on the calendar. Enter an hour
and minute in the two fields below the calendar, and click
`Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the date and time.

The `Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is used to
specify the time it takes to complete the maintenance request. Use the
text-entry field to enter the time in a [00:00]{.title-ref} format.

If `Work Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} was selected in the
`For`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, a
`Block Workcenter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox appears
below the `Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Enable
the checkbox to prevent work orders or other maintenance from being
scheduled at the specified work center while the maintenance request is
being processed.

The `Priority`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is used to
communicate the importance (or urgency) of the maintenance request.
Assign the request a priority between zero and three
`⭐⭐⭐ (stars)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, by clicking on the
desired star number. Requests assigned a higher priority appear above
those with a lower priority, on the Kanban board used to track the
progression of maintenance requests.

In the `Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab at the bottom of
the form, enter any relevant details about the maintenance request (why
the maintenance issue arose, when it occurred, etc.).

The `Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab is used to
include instructions for how maintenance should be performed. Select one
of the three options, and then include the instructions as detailed
below:

- `PDF`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: click the
  `Upload your file`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to open
  the device\'s file manager, and then select a file to upload.
- `Google Slide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter a
  `Google Slide link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
  text-entry field that appears after the option is selected.
- `Text`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the instructions in
  the text-entry field that appears after the option is selected.

![A maintenance request form filled out for a piece of equipment.](maintenance_requests/request-form.png){.align-center}

## Process maintenance request

Once a maintenance request has been created, it appears in the *New
Request* stage of the *Maintenance Requests* page, which can be accessed
by navigating to `Maintenance app
--> Maintenance --> Maintenance Requests`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Maintenance requests can be moved to different stages by dragging and
dropping them. They can also be moved by clicking on a request to open
it in a new page, and then selecting the desired stage from the stage
indicator bar, located above the top-right corner of the request\'s
form.

Successful maintenance requests should be moved to the
`Repaired`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage, indicating that the
specified piece of equipment or work center is repaired.

Failed maintenance requests should be moved to the
`Scrap`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage, indicating the
specified piece of equipment, or work center, could not be repaired, and
must instead be scrapped.

# Maintenance setup

Odoo *Maintenance* helps companies schedule corrective and preventive
maintenance on equipment used in their warehouse. This helps companies
avoid equipment breakdowns, blocks in warehouse work centers, and
emergency repair costs.

## Maintenance teams

When creating maintenance requests, a *maintenance team* can be assigned
to the request as the team responsible for handling the request.

To view existing maintenance teams, navigate to
`Maintenance app --> Configuration
--> Maintenance Teams`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

From the resulting `Teams`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, a
list of all existing teams (if any) is displayed, with the
`Team Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Team Members`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} listed in the columns, by
default.

![List of Teams on Maintenance Teams page.](maintenance_setup/maintenance-setup-teams-list.png){.align-center}

To add a new team, click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This
adds a blank line at the bottom of the list of teams. In the blank field
that appears below the `Team Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column, assign a name to the new maintenance team.

In the `Team Members`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, click
the field to reveal a drop-down menu with existing users in the
database. Choose which users should be members of the new maintenance
team.

Click `Search More...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open a
`Search: Team Members`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
to search for users **not** shown on the initial drop-down menu.

  is expected. This is the **only** field not greyed-out, and the
  **only** field users can edit.
- `Mean Time Between Failure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  amount of time (in days) between reported failures. This value is
  computed based on completed corrective maintenances.
- `Estimated Next Failure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date
  on which the next failure is expected. This date is computed as the
  Latest Failure Date +
  `MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
- `Latest Failure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The date of the
  latest failure. The value in this field updates once a failure is
  reported for this equipment.
- `Mean Time To Repair`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the amount
  of time (in days) it takes to repair this equipment upon failure. This

# Kits

In Odoo, a *kit* is a type of bill of materials (BoM) that can be
manufactured and sold. Kits are sets of unassembled components sold to
customers. They may be sold as standalone products, and are also useful
tools for managing more complex bills of materials (BoMs).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To use, manufacture, and sell kits, both the
`Manufacturing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} apps need to be
installed.
::::

## Create the kit as a product

To use a kit as a sellable product, or as a component organization tool,
the kit should first be created as a product.

To create a kit product, go to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and then click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Then, assign a name to the new kit product. Next, set the kit\'s product
type depending on inventory tracking needs and accounting requirements.
To do this, under the `General Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, set the `Product Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to `Goods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
either check the box next `Track Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} if inventory tracking is required, or leave it
unchecked if inventory tracking for the kit is not necessary.

::: seealso
Learn more about `tracked versus untracked products
<../../inventory/product_management/configure/type>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
:::

The kit\'s components must also be configured as products via
`Inventory app -->
Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. These
components require no specific configuration.

### Untracked kit inventory setup details

Consider leaving tracking for the kit\'s inventory untracked when the
kit is used in other manufacturing processes or when tracking inventory
for the kit itself is not needed.

- **Recommended for Continental Accounting**: If costs are expensed
  immediately upon purchase, then leaving the kit\'s inventory as
  untracked is recommended.
- **Replenishment via Components**: Inventory count is managed at the
  component level, so reordering rules must be set to individual
  components.
- **Selling & Stock Constraints**: Kits cannot be sold if any required
  component is out of stock. Since availability depends on individual
  components, a sales order may appear valid, but delivery can be
  delayed if components are unavailable.

### Tracked kit inventory setup details

Consider turning on tracking for the kit\'s inventory when the kit is a
tangible product or warehouse and inventory tracking is essential.

- **Recommended for Angle-Saxon Accounting**: If the Cost of Goods Sold
  (COGS) needs to be recorded in journals, then tracking the kit\'s
  inventory is recommended.
- **Component Purchase Constraints**: Only the kit\'s minimum required
  components can be added to an **eCommerce** cart unless the option to
  `continue
  selling<../../../websites/ecommerce/products>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} is disabled.
- **No Kit Serial Numbers**: Serial number tracking does not track the
  kit, only its shipped components.
- **Reordering Rule Recommendation**: Reordering rules should be set at
  the component-level.
- **Stock Replenishment Recommendation**: Stock replenishment should
  also be done at the component-level.

### Kit setup similarities

Regardless of which setup is used, there are some similarities between
the two options.

- **No Kit-Level Stock Adjustments**: Stock adjustments cannot be
  handled at the kit-level.
- **Kit Value Does Not Change**: The stock\'s value is the same whether
  the kit\'s is tracked.
- **Kit Internal Transfers**: An internal transfer for the kit breaks it
  into components.

## Set up the kit BoM

After fully configuring the kit product and its components, a new
`BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can be created
for the kit product.

To do so, go to
`Manufacturing app --> Products --> Bills of Materials`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and then click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Next to the `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, click the drop-down menu to reveal a list of
products, and then select the previously configured kit product.

Then, for the `BoM Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, click
the `Kit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. Finally, under the
`Components`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and add each desired
component, and specify their quantities under the

## Use kits to manage complex BoMs

Kits can also be used for complex
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. This method
nests BoMs within other BoMs, organizing complex products while
simplifying manufacturing by defining each procurement and production

# Managing BoMs for product variants

Odoo allows one bill of materials (BoM) to be used for multiple variants
of the same product. Having a consolidated
`BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for a product
with variants saves time by preventing the need to manage multiple
`BoMs (bills of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

## Activate product variants

To activate the product variants feature, navigate to `Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
scroll down to the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section. Then, click the checkbox to enable the
`Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. After that, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to apply the setting.

For more information on configuring product variants, refer to the
`product variants
<../../../sales/sales/products_prices/products/variants>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation.

![Selecting \"Variants\" from Inventory app settings.](product_variants/product-variants-variants-settings.png){.align-center}

## Create custom product attributes

Once the product variants feature is activated, create and edit product
attributes on the `Attributes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.

The `Attributes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page is accessible
either from `Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} by
clicking the `Attributes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, or
by clicking
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Attributes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Once on the `Attributes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, either
click into an existing attribute, or click `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to create a new one. Clicking
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} reveals a new, blank form
for customizing an attribute. For an existing attribute, click
`Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on its form to make changes.

Assign an `Attribute Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
choose a category from the `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field\'s drop-down menu. Then, select the desired options next to the
`Display Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Variants Creation Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields. Once
the desired options are selected, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} under the `Attribute Values`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab to add a new value.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Included on the `Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} row is a
`Is custom value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox. If
selected, this value will be recognized as a custom value, which allows
customers to type special customization requests upon ordering a custom
variant of a product.
::::

::: {.example align="center" alt="Product variant attribute configuration screen."}
.. image:: product_variants/product-variants-attribute.png
:::

Once all desired `Values`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} have been
added, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the new
attribute.

## Add product variants on the product form {#product-variants/add-product-variants}

Created attributes can be applied on specific variants for particular
products. To add product variants to a product, navigate to the product
form by going to `Inventory app -->
Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. To make
changes to the product, click `Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Then, click the `Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

Under the `Attribute`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} header, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add a new attribute,
and select one to add from the drop-down menu.

Then, under the `Values`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} header,
click the drop-down menu to choose from the list of existing values.
Click on each desired value to add them, and repeat this process for any
additional attributes that should be added to the product.

Once finished, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save
changes.

![Product form variants tab with values and attributes.](product_variants/product-variants-product-form.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

`BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} products with
multiple variants that are manufactured in-house should either have a
**0,0 reordering rule** set up, or have their replenishment routes set
to *Replenish on Order (MTO)*.
::::

## Apply BoM components to product variants

Next, create a new `BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. Or, edit an existing one, by going to
`Manufacturing app --> Products --> Bills of Materials`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, click `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to open a new `Bills of Materials`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} form to configure from scratch.

Add a product to the `BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} by clicking the drop-down menu in the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field and selecting the
desired product.

Then, add components by clicking `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} under the `Component`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section of the `Components`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and choosing the desired components from the
drop-down menu.

Choose the desired values in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Product Unit of Measure`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} columns. Then, choose the desired values in the
`Apply on Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Apply on Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option to
assign components to specific product variants on the
`BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is available
once the `Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting is
activated from the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
application. If the `Apply on Variants`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field is not immediately visible, activate it from the
additional options menu (three-dots icon, to the right of the header
row).
::::

![\"Apply on Variants\" option on the additional options menu.](product_variants/product-variants-apply-on-variants.png){.align-center}

Each component can be assigned to multiple variants. Components with no
variants specified are used in every variant of the product. The same
principle applies when configuring operations and by-products.

When defining variant `BoMs (bills of material)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} by component assignment, the
`Product Variant`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field in the main
section of the `BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
should be left blank. This field is *only* used when creating a
`BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} specifically
for one product variant.

When all desired configurations have been made to the
`BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the form to save
changes.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

For components that only apply for specific variants, choose which
operations the components should be consumed in. If the
`Consumed in Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column is
*not* immediately visible, activate it from the additional options menu
(three-dots icon, to the right of the header row).
::::

## Sell and manufacture variants of BoM products

To sell and manufacture variants of
`BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} products to
order, navigate to `Sales app --> Create`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to create a new quotation.

### Sell variant of BoM product

Once on the blank `Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form,
click the drop-down next to the `Customer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field to add a customer.

Then, under the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
click `Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select the
previously-created `BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} product with variants from the drop-down menu. Doing so
reveals a `Configure a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up.

From the pop-up window, click the desired attribute options to configure
the correct variant of the product to manufacture. Then, click the green
`+`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `-`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icons next to the [1]{.title-ref} to change the
quantity to sell and manufacture, if desired.

![Configure a product pop-up for choosing variant attributes.](product_variants/product-variants-variant-popup.png){.align-center}

Once all the specifications have been chosen, click
`Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This will change the pop-up to
a second `Configure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up, where
available optional products will appear, if they have been created
previously.

Once ready, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to close
the pop-up.

Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save all
changes, and click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the
top of the `Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form to create
and confirm a new sales order (SO).

### Manufacture variant of BoM product

Once the `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is confirmed,
a `Manufacturing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button
appears at the top of the `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} form. Click the `Manufacturing`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button to open the
`Manufacturing Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form.

On this form, under the `Components`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, the appropriate components for the chosen variant are listed. And,
depending on the variant, different components will be listed. To see
any mandatory or optional `Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
steps, click the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

To enter the tablet view work order screen, click the
`tablet icon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the right of the row
for the desired operation to be completed.

From the tablet view, click `Mark as Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} as the operation progresses to complete the operation
steps.

Alternatively, click the `Mark as Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button at the top of the manufacturing order form to
complete the order.

![Manufacturing order for variant of BoM product.](product_variants/product-variants-manufacturing-order.png){.align-center}

Then, navigate back to the `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} via the breadcrumbs at the top of the page.

Now that the product has been manufactured, click the
`Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button to deliver
the product to the customer. From the `Delivery Order`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} form, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, then click `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to deliver the product.

To finish the sale, click back to the
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} via the
`breadcrumbs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the page
again. Then, click `Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
followed by `Create
Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} again to invoice the
customer for the order.

# Multilevel BoMs

Use a multilevel bill of materials (BoM) when a manufactured product is
part of another assembly. This method nests
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} within other
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, organizing
complex products while simplifying manufacturing by defining each
procurement and production step separately.

Sublevel `BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
(subassemblies or semifinished products) streamline these production
workflows, and are beneficial when the subassembly is used across
multiple finished products (meaning they\'d appear on multiple top-level
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}). The more
complicated a product is to build or procure, the more value a
multilevel `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can
provide. Because of this, component and subassembly replenishment
planning is vital to ensuring multilevel
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} run smoothly.

## Why replenishment planning is important

`Replenishment <../../inventory/warehouses_storage/replenishment>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is critical for multilevel BoMs to prevent bottlenecks,
manage lead times, and optimize inventory. Without it, missing
components can halt production, delay orders, and increase costs. A
well-planned replenishment strategy ensures `just-in-time availability
<../../inventory/warehouses_storage/replenishment/reordering_rules>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, `automates procurement
<../../inventory/warehouses_storage/replenishment/reordering_rules>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, balances stock levels, and keeps supply chains efficient.
This minimizes delays, reduces manual effort, and ensures smooth
manufacturing.

Manufacturing orders (MO)s that come from a
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} require all
components to be available before the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can be
completed. The `Component Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
that `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} provides
this information. Learn how to
`check an MO's component status <../basic_setup/bill_configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

## Create a multilevel BoM {#manufactuing/advanced/create-multilevel-bom}

To set up a multilevel `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, the top-level product and sublevel products\'s
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} must be
created. If starting from scratch, build the
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} from the
bottom up. Start with the lowest-level product
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, then include
those products as components in higher-level
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

::: example
A printed circuit board (PCB) for a custom keyboard is composed of
hundreds of electronic components, such as transistors, resistors, and
capacitors. Instead of listing all of those components out, a sublevel
product and `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for
a [PCB]{.title-ref} is created, to track the quantities of transistors
and other small components, without needing to overcrowd the top-level
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the custom
keyboard by listing them. Instead, the custom keyboard\'s
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} consists of an
assortment of components and sublevel
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} alike, like
key caps, switches, the PCB, and keyboard plate.
:::

`Learn how to build a simple bill of materials <../basic_setup/bill_configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. For the PCB, this would include the transistors, resistors,
and other components.

![A bill of materials for a PCB.](sub_assemblies/sublevel-bom.png)

After the sublevel products (like the PCB, key caps, and keyboard plate)
are fully configured, create the top-level product by navigating to
`Manufacturing app --> Products -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and then selecting
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. From here, configure the
product\'s specifications as needed.

Once the top-level product (the keyboard) is configured, click the
`Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button on
the product form, and then select `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to make a `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} for the top-level product. Add the sublevel products to
this `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, along
with any other necessary components.

![A bill of materials for a keyboard, containing a bill of materials for a PCB.](sub_assemblies/top-level-bom.png)

## Manage production planning

The two options below are two of the best ways to manage manufacturing
order automation for products with multilevel
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Complex `BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are
specifically used to manage products that require manufactured
components. If a BoM is being created to organize components or bundle
sellable products, `use a kit
<kit_shipping>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} instead.
::::

To automatically trigger manufacturing orders for sublevel products
after confirming a manufacturing order for the main product, there are
two options:

- **Option 1 (recommended):** Create *Reordering Rules* for the sublevel
  products and set both the minimum and maximum needed stock quantities
  to [0]{.title-ref}.
- **Option 2:** Activate the
  `Replenish on Order (MTO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Manufacture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} routes under the
  `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the sublevel
  product\'s product form.

::: seealso
\-
`../../inventory/warehouses_storage/replenishment/reordering_rules`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} -
`../../inventory/warehouses_storage/replenishment/mto`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

Option 1 is more flexible than Option 2 and is recommended. Reordering
rules do not directly link demand to replenishment, allowing stock to be
unreserved and reassigned as needed. The Replenish on Order (MTO) route,
however, uniquely links sublevel and top-level products, reserving
quantities for the confirmed top-level manufacturing order.

In both methods, sublevel products must be fully manufactured before
starting the top-level product.

## Multilevel BoM setup flow

The following section details how to set up multilevel BoMs, set the
initial inventory, establish a
`0/0/1 reordering rule <manufacturing/advanced/procurement-method>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (the recommended production plan), configure lead times, and
set up production options.

Creating a 0/0/1 reordering rule for the sublevel products (minimum
stock set at zero, maximum stock set at zero, reorder one automatically)
regardless of whether they are a component or subassembly is the
recommended approach for managing a multilevel
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. This setup
uses the **Inventory**, **Manufacturing**, and **Purchase** apps.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

This is only one example of how to set up a multilevel
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in Odoo.
Consider any unique circumstances that need to be addressed during the
configuration, and make sure they are included in the setup. If any
specific help is needed during setup, consider purchasing a [success
pack](https://www.odoo.com/pricing-packs).
::::

### Create the BoMs

Follow the steps in the
`Create a multilevel BoM <manufactuing/advanced/create-multilevel-bom>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} section to build the
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Make sure to build the multilevel
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} from the bottom
up. Start by creating the lowest-level component products in Odoo, then
the subassembly products that those are used for, then the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for that
subassembly, and repeat until every level of the multilevel
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is created.

### Set the initial inventory

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If there\'s no initial inventory to configure, then skip this section
and begin configuring the procurement method for the multilevel
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
::::

Update the quantity on hand for each of the products configured in the
prior step (both components, subassemblies, and the final product). To
do this, open the **Inventory** app, and then find the products with
filters, the search bar, or scrolling, and then click on them to open
their product form. From here, click the `On Hand`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button, `select the variant
<../../../sales/sales/products_prices/products/variants>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} if that was configured, and then enter the quantity on hand.

::: seealso
`../../inventory/warehouses_storage/inventory_management/count_products`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

### Configure the procurement method {#manufacturing/advanced/procurement-method}

Now it is time to pick the procurement method this multilevel
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} uses. The two
options below are preferred, but unique circumstances may lead to
another procurement method making more sense.

- **Option 1 (recommended):** Create *Reordering Rules* for the sublevel
  products and set both the minimum and maximum needed stock quantities
  to [0]{.title-ref}.
- **Option 2:** Activate the
  `Replenish on Order (MTO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Manufacture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} routes under the
  `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the sublevel
  product\'s product form.

::: seealso
\-
`../../inventory/warehouses_storage/replenishment/reordering_rules`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} -
`../../inventory/warehouses_storage/replenishment/mto`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

Reordering rules are recommended because they do not tie the
manufactured product to a specific sales order, allowing that
manufactured product to fulfill a different sales order if the original
gets cancelled.

Making the product to order is not recommended because the manufactured
product cannot be used to fulfill another sales order. However, this
could be helpful if strict tracking is necessary for the business.

### Enter vendor and manufacturing lead times

Vendor and manufacturing lead times are used by Odoo to coordinate
production and procurement actions to fulfill orders on time. Set vendor
lead times for components that are purchased. These can appear at any
level in a multilevel `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} except the final product. Set manufacturing lead times for
products that are built using a
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. These can
appear at any level in a multilevel
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} except the
lowest level (when individual components are procured).

::: seealso
`../../inventory/warehouses_storage/replenishment/lead_times`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

### Build out operations to handle the production flow

First, determine the current manufacturing flow for the business, then
match the corresponding Odoo setup. The list below are only some of the
configuration pieces that could be involved in this step.

- **Manufacturing Steps**: Consider how many manufacturing steps are
  taken (one-, two-, or three-step manufacturing).
- **Work Centers**: Decide if any
  `work centers <using_work_centers>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} need
  to be configured.
- **Master Production Schedule**: If manually planned manufacturing
  orders are needed (e.g., to handle seasonal demand), make a
  `master production schedule <../workflows/use_mps>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} (MPS).

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Manufacturing operations is an art and a science, so configuring an
established flow into Odoo is the recommended approach for this step.
Read more about `manufacturing in Odoo
<../../manufacturing>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
::::

### Configuration summary

At the end of this process, the multilevel
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is configured,
and the top-level product has its inventory counts, procurement method
set, procurement lead times, and manufacturing operations configured.
From here, sales orders can include the top-level product, automatic
procurement through vendors or manufacturing can begin, the top-level
product can be included in an **eCommerce** store.

# Work centers

*Work centers* are where **Manufacturing** work orders are processed,
and can be used to track costs, make schedules, plan capacity, organize
equipment, and track efficiency. Specifying a work center is required
when a work order is defined in the *Operations* tab of a bill of
materials (BoM) for a product.

:::: important
::: title

Work centers only appear if the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} setting is enabled. To do so, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then tick the `Work
Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox. Work orders can be
managed in the `Manufacturing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app by
selecting `Operations --> Work Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

## Work center configuration

### Create a new work center {#manufacturing/management/using_work_centers/wc-setup}

In the **Manufacturing** app, select
`Configuration --> Work Centers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
and click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to open a
new work center form.

![An example of a fully configured work center form.](using_work_centers/work-center-form.png)

- `Work Center Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the label for
  the work center used to select it on a work order or on the reporting
  dashboards
- `Tag`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: reusable labels that can be
  used to sort work centers in list view
- `Alternative Workcenters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: where a
  work order should be carried out if this work center is not available
- `Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: reference id for the work
  center that is displayed in the list view
- `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the hours that
  work center can be used during the week

#### Working hours {#manufacturing/management/using_work_centers/working-hours}

*Working hours* define when a work center should operate, based on a
one- or two-week schedule. These hours also form the basis for
calculating *overall equipment efficiency* (OEE).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

By default, Odoo uses the [Standard 40 hours/week]{.title-ref} working
hours, which expects work centers to operate between 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM
on Monday through Friday.
::::

To change the working hours, hover over the current
`Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} value and click the
`fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
(`Internal link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) icon to open the
working hours form.

![The working hours form for Standard 40 hours/week.](using_work_centers/working-hours-form.png)

To create a new set of working hours, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button and give it a name. From here, edit any
`Work from`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Work to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} value to adjust the time
range. Remove a line by clicking click the
`fa-trash-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(trash)`{.interpreted-text

### Set productivity standards and allowed employees

The `General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on the
work center form allows for productivity goals to be assigned to a work
center. These are used as the basis for calculating how much of the
potential time the work center is being used and its operating costs.

![The general information tab of the work center form.](using_work_centers/work-center-general-information.png)

- `Time Efficiency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a multiplier for
  how using this work center affects the normal speed of execution of a
  work order

  ::: example
  If a work center has older equipment and work orders take twice as
  long to produce, the [Time Efficiency]{.title-ref} would be
  [50.00%]{.title-ref}.
  :::

- `Capacity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the number of products
  that can be processed at the work center simultaneously

- `OEE Target`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the target for
  efficiency at the work center

  ::: example
  If a work center is available for [8 hours per day]{.title-ref} but is
  only expected to be used for [7 hours per day]{.title-ref}, the OEE

### Integrate IoT devices {#workcenter_iot}

The `IoT Triggers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab enables the
integration of `IoT (Internet of Things)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
devices with a work center:

- `Device`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: specifies the IoT device
  to be triggered
- `Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the security key for the
  device
- `Action`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the IoT device action
  triggered

![The IoT Triggers tab of the work center form.](using_work_centers/work-center-iot.png)

## Assigning equipment to work centers

The **Maintenance** app makes it possible to add specific equipment to a
work center and individually track its costs and productivity. It also
adds the `Equipment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Maintenance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tabs to the work center
form, used to list equipment and schedule maintenance activities.

::: seealso
`../../maintenance/add_new_equipment`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}

### Configure equipment

Using the `Equipment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, it is
possible for specific pieces of equipment to be assigned to a work
center. The following information is displayed for each piece of
equipment added:

- `Equipment Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the name of the
  piece of equipment
- `Technician`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the technician
  responsible for servicing the equipment
- `Equipment Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the category
  the equipment belongs to
- `MTBF`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: mean time between failures;
  the average time that the piece of equipment will operate before
  failing
- `MTTR`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: mean time to recovery; the
  average time it takes for the equipment to become fully operational
  again
- `Est. Next Failure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: an estimate of
  when the next equipment failure will occur

![The equipment tab of the work center form.](using_work_centers/work-center-equipment.png)

:::: note
::: title

data, if any exists.
::::

## Work center planning

The currently scheduled work orders can be viewed by accessing
`Manufacturing app -->
Planning --> Planning by Workcenter`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![The Gantt view of planning showing two assembly work centers.](using_work_centers/work-center-planning.png)

Different views show how many individual work orders are scheduled, how
many minutes of each hour the work center is in production, and the
dates and times that are currently scheduled for work orders. Times and
planned work centers can be changed by clicking to access the individual
work order.

## Work center performance

Performance for an individual work center can be viewed by selecting
`Configuration
--> Work Centers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and clicking
on a work center. Metrics are displayed in smart buttons at the top of
the form.

![A work center form with smart buttons showing performance metrics.](using_work_centers/work-center-smart-buttons.png)

- `OEE`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: overall equipment
  effectiveness, the percentage of time that the work center has been
  productive out of its available work hours.

  > ::: seealso
  > - `../reporting/oee`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
  > :::

- `Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the amount of time lost due
  to work stoppages

- `Load`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the amount of time it will
  take to complete the current workload

- `Performance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the real duration of
  work time, shown as a percentage of the expected duration

## Use case: measuring performance by shift using work centers

Work centers support defined working hours, enabling the tracking of
production efficiency by shift. To configure shift-based tracking,
create working hours for each of the shifts, then duplicate versions of
each work center for each of the shifts. With this setup, comparing
shift productivity can be done with any of the available
`reporting <../../../essentials/reporting>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} tools.

### Working hours for multiple shifts

To create working hours for multiple shifts, open a work center form and
in the `Working
Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field click the
`fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
(`Internal link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), and then click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to create a new set of
hours for the second shift.

::: example
A manufacturer has two shifts: a day shift from 5 AM to 1 PM and a night
shift from 1 PM to 9 PM. Starting from any existing work center, edit
the existing working hours to match the day shift.

![The working hours for a day shift](using_work_centers/example-shift-day.png)

Once the day shift is saved, click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(cog)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and select
`Duplicate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Rename this new schedule
[Night Shift]{.title-ref} and change each `Work
from`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to 1 PM and
`Work from`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to 9 PM.

![The working hours for a night shift](using_work_centers/example-shift-night.png)
:::

### Work centers for multiple shifts

To create the duplicate work centers, return to the work center view by
navigating to `Configuration --> Work Centers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and duplicating each of the work centers that are
used by both shifts, either on the individual work center forms, or
directly from the list view.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To duplicate work centers directly from the list view, click the
`fa-check-square-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(checkbox)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that appears above the
list items to select all. Then, click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the
top of the list and select `Duplicate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

::::: example
A manufacturer has two work centers, [Assembly Line 1]{.title-ref} and
[Assembly Line 2]{.title-ref}, and two working hours, [Day
Shift]{.title-ref} and [Night Shift]{.title-ref}.

![Work centers copied for day and night shifts.](using_work_centers/work-centers-with-shifts.png)

To create versions of [Assembly Line 1]{.title-ref} and [Assembly Line
2]{.title-ref} for each shift, duplicate each of the work centers.
Select the first work center and add the shift name in that work
center\'s name and assign it the appropriate working hours. Optionally,
configure each work center to use its opposite shift counterpart as an
alternate work center to make sure that manufacturing orders get
assigned to both. Tags can also help make a visual distinction between
each shift.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Use the `oi-chevron-left`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(left arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`oi-chevron-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(right arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons in the top
left corner to move on to the next form in the list without returning to
the list view.
::::
:::::

### Reports comparing different shifts

With multiple work centers created to represent shifts, reports that
sort by work center will now compare shifts. This can be used to compare
the number of work orders that are being assigned each shift, the OEE,
or actual time that each shift is taking to produce a product.

::: example
A report has been created to compare the time efficiency of two shifts
producing the same product in the same work center.

![A bar graph of two work centers with duration deviations of -6.50 and 15.00](using_work_centers/work-order-duration-deviation.png)

To create this report, go to
`Reporting --> Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
click to remove the `fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} **Ready**
*or* **Waiting** *or* **Pending** *or* **In Progress** filter by
clicking the `fa-x`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Remove`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon on its right side.
Next, click the `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and
select `Duration Deviation (%)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

In this case, the day shift has on average taken more than the expected
time to produce products (-6.50%) while the night shift took less than
the expected time (15.00%).

# Work order dependencies

When manufacturing certain products, specific operations may need to be
completed before others can begin. In order to ensure operations are
carried out in the correct order, Odoo *Manufacturing* features a *work
order dependencies* setting. Enabling this setting allows for operations
on a Bill of Materials (BoM) to be *blocked* by other operations that
should occur first.

## Configuration

The *work order dependencies* setting is not enabled by default. To
enable it, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, enable the `Work
Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting, if it is not already
active.

After enabling the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
setting, the `Work Order Dependencies`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} setting appears below it. Enable
`Work Order Dependencies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the changes.

## Add dependencies to BoM

Work order dependencies are configured on a product\'s
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. To do so,
navigate to
`Manufacturing --> Products --> Bills of Materials`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then select a
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, or create a
new one by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: admonition
Learn more

For a complete guide on how to properly configure a new
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, see the
documentation on
`creating a bill of materials <../basic_setup/bill_configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
:::

On the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, click
on the `Miscellaneous`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, then
enable the `Operation
Dependencies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox. This makes a
new `Blocked By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option available in
the settings of the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![The Operation Dependencies checkbox on the Miscellaneous tab of a BoM.](work_order_dependencies/operation-dependencies.png){.align-center}

Next, click on the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
On the top-right of the tab, click on the tab\'s
`settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, then enable the
`Blocked By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox. This makes a
`Blocked By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appear for each
operation on the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![The settings for the Operations tab on a BoM.](work_order_dependencies/operations-settings.png){.align-center}

In the line of the operation that should be blocked by another
operation, click the `Blocked By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, and an `Open: Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window appears. In the `Blocked By`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down field on the pop-up window, select the
blocking operation that must be completed *before* the operation that is
blocked.

![The Blocked By drop-down field for an operation on a BoM.](work_order_dependencies/blocked-by.png){.align-center}

Finally, save the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} by clicking `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Plan work orders using dependencies

Once work order dependencies have been configured on a
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, Odoo
*Manufacturing* is able to plan when work orders are scheduled, based on
their dependencies. To plan the work orders for a manufacturing order,
begin by navigating to `Manufacturing --> Operations -->
Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Next, select a manufacturing order for a product with work order
dependencies set on its `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, or create a new manufacturing order by clicking
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If a new manufacturing order
is created, select a `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} configured with work order dependencies from the `Bill of
Material`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field, then click
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

After confirming the manufacturing order, select the
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to view the work
orders required to complete it. Any work orders that are *not* blocked
by a different work order display a [Ready]{.title-ref} tag in the
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

Work orders that are blocked by one or more work orders display a
[Waiting for another WO]{.title-ref} tag instead. Once the blocking work
order(s) are completed, the tag updates to [Ready]{.title-ref}.

![The status tags for work orders on a manufacturing order.](work_order_dependencies/work-order-status.png){.align-center}

To schedule the manufacturing order\'s work orders, click the
`Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top of the page.
After doing so, the `Scheduled Start Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field for each work order on the
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab auto-fills with the
scheduled start date and time. A blocked work order is scheduled at the
end of the time period specified in the
`Expected Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field of the work
order that precedes it.

![The Scheduled Start Date field for work orders on a manufacturing order.](work_order_dependencies/scheduled-start-date.png){.align-center}

::: example
A manufacturing order is created for Product A. The manufacturing order
has two operations: Cut and Assemble. Each operation has an expected
duration of 60 minutes, and the Assemble operation is blocked by the Cut
operation.

The `Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button for the
manufacturing order is clicked at 1:30 pm, and the Cut operation is
scheduled to begin immediately. Since the Cut operation has an expected
duration of 60 minutes, the Assemble operation is scheduled to begin at
2:30 pm.
:::

### Planning by workcenter

To see a visual representation of how work orders are planned, navigate
to the `Work
Orders Planning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page by going to
`Manufacturing --> Planning --> Planning by
Workcenter`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. This page shows a
timeline of all the work orders scheduled for each operation.

If one work order is blocked by the completion of another, the work
order that is blocked is shown as scheduled to start after the work
order blocking it. In addition, an arrow connects the two work orders,
leading from the blocking operation to the blocked operation.

![The arrow connecting a blocked work order to the work order blocking it.](work_order_dependencies/planning-arrow.png){.align-center}

# Bill of materials

A *bill of materials* (or *BoM* for short) documents specific
components, along with their respective quantities, that are needed to
produce or repair a product. In Odoo,
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} serve as
blueprints for manufactured goods and kits, and often include production
operations and step-by-step guidelines, as well.

## BoM setup

To create a `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, go
to
`Manufacturing app --> Products --> Bills of Materials`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Next, set the `BoM Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Manufacture this Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then, specify
`required components <manufacturing/basic_setup/setup-components>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and, if necessary, define any
`manufacturing operations <manufacturing/basic_setup/setup-operations>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

:::: tip

## Add by-products to BoMs

A *by-product* is a residual product that is created during production
in addition to the main product of a
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Unlike the
primary product, there can be more than one by-product on a
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

To add by-products to a `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, first enable the *By-Products* feature in
`Manufacturing app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. In the `Operations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, tick the checkbox for
`By-Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to enable the feature.

![\"By Products\" feature in the settings page.](bill_configuration/by-products.png){.align-center}

Once the feature is enabled, add by-products to a
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by clicking the
`By-products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and fill in the
`By-product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Unit of Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Optionally,
specify a `Produced in Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
the by-product.

# Manufacturing product configuration

In order to manufacture a product in Odoo *Manufacturing*, the product
must be properly configured. Doing so consists of enabling the
*Manufacturing* route and configuring a bill of materials (BoM) for the
product. Once these steps are completed, the product is selectable when
creating a new manufacturing order.

## Activate the Manufacture route

The Manufacture route is activated for each product on its own product
page. To do so, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, select an existing product, or create a new
one by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

On the product page, select the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, then enable the `Manufacture`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox in the `Routes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section. This tells Odoo the product can be
manufactured.

![The Manufacturing route on the Inventory tab of a product page.](configure_manufacturing_product/manufacturing-route.png){.align-center}

### Lot/serial number tracking {#manufacturing/basic_setup/lot-serial-tracking}

The assignment of lots or serial numbers to newly manufactured products
is optional. To optionally
`assign lots or serial numbers <../../inventory/product_management/product_tracking>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to newly manufactured products, go to the
`Traceability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section in the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. In the
`Tracking`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select
`By Unique Serial
Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`By Lots`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Doing so enables the *Lot/Serial Number* field on a manufacturing order,
or the *Register Production* instruction on a work order card in the
*Shop Floor* app.

</figure>

## Configure a bill of materials (BoM)

Next, a [\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|) must be configured for the product so
Odoo knows how it is manufactured. A [\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|) is a list
of the components and operations required to manufacture a product.

To create a [\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|) for a specific product, navigate
to `Manufacturing --> Products -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, then select the
product. On the product page, click the
`Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at
the top of the page, then select `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to configure a new [\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|).

![The Bill of Materials smart button on a product page.](configure_manufacturing_product/bom-smart-button.png){.align-center}

On the [\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|), the `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field auto-populates with the product. In the
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, specify the number
of units that the BoM produces.

Add a component to the [\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|) by selecting the
`Components`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and clicking `Add
a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Select a component from the
`Component`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu, then
enter the quantity in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. Continue adding components on new lines until all components have
been added.

![The Components tab on a bill of materials.](configure_manufacturing_product/components-tab.png){.align-center}

Next, select the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
Click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a `Create
Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears. In
the `Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, specify the
name of the operation being added (e.g. Assemble, Cut, etc.). Select the
work center where the operation will be carried out from the
`Work Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu.
Finally, click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
finish adding operations, or `Save & New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to add more.

# Manufacturing order costs

The ability to accurately calculate the cost of manufacturing a product
is critical when determining product profitability. Odoo\'s
**Manufacturing** app simplifies this calculation by automatically
calculating the cost to complete each manufacturing order (MO), as well
as the average production cost of a product, based on all completed
`MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo\'s Manufacturing app distinguishes between the *MO cost* and the
*real cost* of an `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

The `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} cost
represents how much it *should* cost to complete an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, based on the
configuration of the product\'s bill of materials (BoM). This takes into
account the cost and quantity of components, as well as the cost of
completing the necessary operations.

The real cost represents how much it *actually* costs to complete the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. A few factors
can cause the real cost to differ from the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} cost. For
example, an operation may take longer to complete than estimated, a
greater component quantity might be needed than was specified on the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, or the price
of components may change during manufacturing.
::::

## Cost configuration

Odoo computes `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
costs based on the configuration of the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} used to
manufacture a product. This calculation includes the cost and quantity
of components and operations listed on the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, in addition to
the operating costs of the work centers where those operations are
carried out, and the amount paid to each employee who works on an
operation.

### Component cost

Component cost is calculated automatically, based on the average
purchase cost of a component across all purchase orders (POs). To view a
component\'s cost, navigate to `Inventory app -->
Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select a
component product. The cost is displayed in the `Cost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field of the `General Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, on the component\'s product form.

It is possible to set the cost of a component manually, by clicking the
`Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the component\'s
product form and entering a value. However, any future
`POs (Purchase Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the component
override a manually entered value, resetting the
`Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field back to an automatically
computed value.

### Work center cost {#manufacturing/mo-costs/work-center-cost}

To set the operating cost for a specific work center, navigate to
`Manufacturing app
--> Configuration --> Work Centers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a work center.

To set the cost of operating the work center for one hour, enter a value
in the `per
workcenter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, located beside the
`Cost per hour`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section on the work
center\'s `General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

To set the hourly cost of each employee that operates the work center,
enter a value in the `per employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, located beside the `Cost per hour`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section on the work center\'s
`General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. For
example, if [25.00]{.title-ref} is entered in the
`per employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, it costs
\$25.00 per hour for *each* employee working at the work center.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The value entered in the `per employee`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field is only used to calculate the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} cost, which is
the estimated cost of completing the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

The actual cost of completing the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is represented
by the real cost. Instead of using the value entered in the
`per employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, the real cost
is calculated using the hourly cost specific to each employee.

For example, if the `per employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
cost of a work center is \'\$50.00\', and an employee with an hourly
cost of \'\$60.00\' completes a work order there, the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} cost
(estimated) is calculated using the \$50/hr cost, while the real cost is
calculated using the \$60/hr cost.

See the
`employee cost section <manufacturing/mo-costs/employee-cost>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} below for information on how to set the cost for specific
employees.
::::

### Employee cost {#manufacturing/mo-costs/employee-cost}

To set the hourly cost for a specific employee, navigate to the
`Employees`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, and select an
employee. On the employee\'s form, select the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and enter the
employee\'s rate in the `Hourly Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field of the `Application Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

As detailed in the
`work center cost section <manufacturing/mo-costs/work-center-cost>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} above, the value entered in the
`Hourly Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the
employee\'s form is used to calculate the real cost of an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. The estimated
cost of an `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
referred to as the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} cost, uses the per employee cost set on each work center\'s
form.
::::

### `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} configuration {#bom-configuration}

Configuring a `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
so Odoo can accurately calculate the cost of
`MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that use it
requires two steps. First, components **must** be added, and the
required quantity specified. Second, operations **must** be added, along
with the work centers where they are carried out.

Begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing app --> Products --> Bills of Materials`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select a
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, or create a
new one by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In the `Components`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form, add each
component by clicking `Add a
line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, selecting the component from
the drop-down menu in the `Component`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column, and entering the quantity in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column.

In the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, add an
operation by clicking `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
open the `Create Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window. Enter a title for the operation in the
`Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Select the `Work Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} where the
operation is carried out. Then, add a
`Default Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which is the
estimated amount of time the operation takes to complete.

By default, the `Duration Computation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field is set to
`Set duration manually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which means
that the number entered in `Default Duration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field is always used as the expected duration of the
operation.

Selecting `Compute based on tracked time`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} causes Odoo to automatically compute the
`Default Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} based on a certain
number of work orders, which is set in the `Based on`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. Before there are work orders to compute this
duration, the value in the `Default Duration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field is used instead.

The hourly cost of operating the work center, and the duration of the
operation, are used to calculate the operation\'s cost.

Finally, click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add
the operation to the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, and close the `Create Operations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window. Alternatively, click
`Save & New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add the operation to
the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and open a
blank `Create Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window to add another operation.

For a full overview of `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} configuration, see the documentation on `bills of materials
<bill_configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
:::

## `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} overview {#mo-overview}

Each `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} has an
*overview* page, which lists a variety of information about the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, including
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} cost and real
cost. To view the overview for an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, navigate to
`Manufacturing
app --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Then, click
the `fa-bars`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the top of
the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Both the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} cost
and real cost take into account the cost and quantity of components, as
well as the cost of completing each work order. The overview page lists
a row for each of these values, with the sum of them listed at the
bottom of the `MO Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Real Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns.

Before work begins on an `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, the `MO Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Real Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns display the same
costs. This is the *estimated* cost of completing the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

However, once work commences, the values in the
`Real Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column may begin to
diverge from the values in the `MO Cost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column. This happens if a different component quantity
is used than was listed on the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the duration
of a work order is different than expected, or the hourly cost of the
employee performing a work order differs from the employee cost set on
the work center.

Once the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} has
been completed by clicking `Produce All`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, the values in the `MO Cost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column update to match those displayed in the
`Real Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

![The MO Overview page.](mo_costs/overview.png){.align-center}

## Average manufacturing cost

In addition to the cost of each individual
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for a product,
Odoo also tracks the average cost of manufacturing the product, taking
into account the cost of every completed
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. To view this,
navigate to `Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a product.

The manufacturing cost of the product is displayed per unit of measure
in the `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, located in the
`General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. The value
continues to update as the costs of additional
`MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are factored
into the average cost.

To the right of the `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is a
`Compute Price from BoM`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button,
which only appears for products with at least one
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Click this
button to reset the cost of the product to the expected cost, which only
takes into account the components and operations listed on the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Be aware that clicking `Compute Price from BoM`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} does not set the price permanently. The cost continues
to update based on the average of the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} price and the
real cost of any future `MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.
::::

::: {.admonition .alert .alert-success}
Example workflow: manufacturing cost

Golf product manufacturer *Fairway Fields* produces a variety of golf
products, including an indoor *putting green*. They have configured a
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the putting
green, so Odoo automatically calculates the manufacturing cost of each
putting green `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

The `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} lists two
components:

- One unit of *green felt*, which costs \$20.00.
- One unit of a *rubber pad*, which costs \$30.00.

The `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} also lists
four operations, all of which are carried out at *Assembly Station 1*,
which has an hourly operating cost of \$30.00. Those operations are as
follows:

- *Cut felt*: default duration of seven minutes, for a total cost of
  \$3.50.
- *Cut rubber pad*: default duration of five minutes, for a total cost
  of \$2.50.
- *Attach pad to felt*: default duration of 15 minutes, for a total cost
  of \$7.50.
- *Cut holes*: default duration of three minutes, for a total cost of
  \$1.50.

Altogether, the components required to produce one putting green cost
\$50.00, and the operations required cost \$15.00, for a total
manufacturing cost of \$65.00. This cost is reflected in the
`Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the putting green\'s
product form.

Fairway Fields confirms an `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} for one putting green. Before manufacturing starts, the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} overview lists
a cost of [\$65.00]{.title-ref} in both the `MO Cost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Real Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
fields.

![The MO Overview page for one putting green, before production starts.](mo_costs/overview-before.png){.align-center}

Manufacturing begins, and the operations take ten minutes longer than
expected, for a total manufacturing time of 40 minutes. This deviation
from the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
reflected on the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} overview, which now lists a `Real Cost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of [\$70.00]{.title-ref}.

![The MO Overview page for one putting green, during production.](mo_costs/overview-during.png){.align-center}

Once manufacturing is finished, and the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is marked as
*Done*, the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
overview updates again, so the values in the `MO Cost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Real Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
columns match, each displaying a value of [\$70.00]{.title-ref}.

On the putting green\'s product page, the `Cost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field now displays a cost of [\$67.50]{.title-ref}, the
average of the original cost of \$65.00 and the real cost of \$70.00
from the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

# One-step manufacturing

Odoo *Manufacturing* allows users to manufacture products using one,
two, or three steps. When using one-step manufacturing, Odoo creates a
manufacturing order (MO), but does not generate transfers for the
movement of components out of inventory or finished products into stock.
Inventory counts still update based on the number of components used and
products manufactured, but the act of transferring them to and from
inventory is not tracked.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The number of steps used in manufacturing is set at the warehouse level,
allowing for each warehouse to use a different number of steps. To
change the number of steps used for a specific warehouse, begin by
navigating to
`Inventory --> Configuration --> Warehouses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and then select a warehouse from the
`Warehouses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} screen.

On the `Warehouse Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
find the `Manufacture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} radio input
field, and select one of the three options:
`Manufacture (1 step)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Pick
components and then manufacture (2 steps)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Pick components, manufacture and then

Products must be properly configured before they can be manufactured in
Odoo. For details on how to do so, see the documentation on how to
`configure a product for manufacturing
<manufacturing/management/configure-manufacturing-product>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

## Create manufacturing order

To manufacture a product in Odoo *Manufacturing*, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and then click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to create a new
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

On the new `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
select the product to be produced from the `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu. The
`Bill of Material`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
auto-populates with the associated bill of materials (BoM).

If a product has more than one [\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|) configured for
it, the specific [\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|) can be selected in the
`Bill of Material`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field auto-populates with
the associated product.

After a [\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|) has been selected, the
`Components`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tabs auto-populate with
the components and operations specified on the
[\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|). If additional components or operations are
required for the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} being configured, add them to the
`Components`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tabs by clicking
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Finally, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm
the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

## Process manufacturing order

An `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
processed by completing all of the work orders listed under its
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. This can be done
on the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} itself,
or from the work order tablet view.

### Basic workflow

To complete work orders from the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} itself, begin
by navigating to `Manufacturing
--> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and then select an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

On the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} page,
select the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Once
work begins on the first work order that needs to be completed, click
the `Start`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button for that work
order. Odoo *Manufacturing* then starts a timer that keeps track of how
long the work order takes to complete.

![The Start button for an operation on a manufacturing order.](one_step_manufacturing/start-button.png){.align-center}

When the work order is completed, click the `Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button for that work order. Repeat the same process for
each work order listed on the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.

![The Done button for an operation on a manufacturing order.](one_step_manufacturing/done-button.png){.align-center}

After completing all of the work orders, click
`Produce All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the
screen to mark the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} as `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and register
the manufactured product(s) into inventory.

### Shop Floor workflow

To complete the work orders for an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} using the
*Shop Floor* module, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and then select an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

On the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, click
on the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and then
select the `↗️ (square
with arrow coming out of it)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
on the line of the first work order to be processed. Doing so opens a
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, with
details and processing options for the work order.

On the pop-up window, select the `Open Shop Floor`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button at the top-left of the window to open the *Shop

When accessed directly from a specific work order within an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, *Shop Floor*
defaults to the page for the work center where the work order is
configured to be carried out. The page shows a card for the work order
that displays the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} number, the product and number of units to be produced, and
the steps required to complete the work order.

![A work order card on a work center page in the Shop Floor module.](one_step_manufacturing/work-order-card.png){.align-center}

A work order is processed by completing each step listed on its card.
This can be done by clicking on a step and following the instructions
listed on the pop-up window that appears. Once the step is completed,
click `Next`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to move on to the next
step, if any are required.

Alternatively, work order steps can be completed by clicking the
checkbox that appears on the right side of the step\'s line on the work
order card. When using this method, the step is automatically marked as
completed, without a pop-up window appearing.

The final step on a work order card is titled *Register Production*.
This step is used to register the number of product units that were
produced. If the number produced is equal to the number that the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} was created
for, click the `# Units`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on
the right side of the line to automatically register that number as the
quantity produced.

If a different number must be entered, click the
`Register Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} step to open a
pop-up window. Enter the number of units produced in the
`Units`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and then click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to register that number.

The *Register Production* step appears on every work order card. It must
be completed for the first work order that is processed. After doing so,
the step appears as already completed for each remaining work order in
the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
::::

After completing all of the steps for a work order, a button appears on
the footer of the work order card. If any other work orders must be
completed before the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} can be closed, the button is titled
`Mark as Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If there are no
additional work orders to complete, the button is titled
`Close Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Clicking `Mark as Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} causes the
work order card to fade away. Once it disappears completely, the work
order\'s status is marked as *Finished* on the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and the next
work order appears in the *Shop Floor* module, on the page of the work
center where it is configured to be carried out. Any additional work
orders can be processed using the instructions detailed in this section.

Clicking `Close Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} causes
the work order card to fade away. Once it disappears, the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is marked as
*Done*, and the units of the product that were produced are entered into
inventory.

After clicking `Mark as Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Close Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, each button is

# Three-step manufacturing

Odoo *Manufacturing* allows users to manufacture products using one,
two, or three steps. When using three-step manufacturing, Odoo creates a
pick components transfer, a manufacturing order (MO), and a store
finished products transfer, and updates inventory counts based on the
number of components removed, and finished products created.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The number of steps used in manufacturing is set at the warehouse level,
allowing for each warehouse to use a different number of steps. To
change the number of steps used for a specific warehouse, begin by
navigating to
`Inventory --> Configuration --> Warehouses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and then select a warehouse from the
`Warehouses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} screen.

On the `Warehouse Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
find the `Manufacture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} radio input
field, and select one of the three options:
`Manufacture (1 step)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Pick
components and then manufacture (2 steps)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Pick components, manufacture and then
store products (3 steps)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Manufacture radio input field on a warehouse configuration page.](three_step_manufacturing/manufacturing-type.png){.align-center}

Products must be properly configured before they can be manufactured in
Odoo. For details on how to do so, see the documentation on how to
`configure a product for manufacturing
<manufacturing/management/configure-manufacturing-product>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

## Create manufacturing order

To manufacture a product in Odoo *Manufacturing*, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and then click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to create a new
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

On the new `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
select the product to be produced from the `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu. The
`Bill of Material`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
auto-populates with the associated Bill of Materials (BoM).

If a product has more than one [\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|) configured for
it, the specific [\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|) can be selected in the
`Bill of Material`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field auto-populates with
the associated product.

After a [\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|) has been selected, the
`Components`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tabs auto-populate with
the components and operations specified on the
[\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|). If additional components or operations are
required for the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} being configured, add them to the
`Components`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tabs by clicking
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Finally, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm
the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

## Process pick components transfer

After confirming a three-step
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, a
`Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button appears at
the top of the page. Click it to be taken to the
`Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page for the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. The page
lists two transfers: *WH/PC/XXXXX* (the pick components transfer), and
*WH/SFP/XXXXX* (the store finished products transfer).

Select `WH/PC/XXXXX`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open the pick
components transfer for the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. This transfer is used to track the movement of components
from the locations where they are stored to the location where they are
used to manufacture the product.

After transferring the components out of their storage location, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the
transfer, followed by `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
`Immediate Transfer?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
that appears. Doing so marks the transfer as `Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and updates inventory counts to reflect the quantity
of components transferred.

Finally, return to the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} by clicking the `WH/MO/XXXXX`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} breadcrumb at the top of the page.

![The manufacturing order bread crumb on a pick components transfer.](three_step_manufacturing/mo-bread-crumb.png){.align-center}

## Process manufacturing order

An `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
processed by completing all of the work orders listed under its
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. This can be done
on the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} itself,
or from the work order tablet view.

### Basic workflow

To complete work orders from the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} itself, begin
by navigating to `Manufacturing
--> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and then select a manufacturing order.

On the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} page,
select the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Once
work begins on the first work order that needs to be completed, click
the `Start`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button for that work
order. Odoo *Manufacturing* then starts a timer that keeps track of how
long the work order takes to complete.

![The Start button for a work order on a manufacturing order.](three_step_manufacturing/start-button-2.png){.align-center}

When the work order is completed, click the `Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button for that work order. Repeat the same process for
each work order listed on the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.

![The Done button for an work order on a manufacturing order.](three_step_manufacturing/done-button.png){.align-center}

After completing all of the work orders, click
`Produce All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the
screen to mark the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} as `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and register
the manufactured product(s) into inventory.

### Shop Floor workflow

To complete the work orders for an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} using the
*Shop Floor* module, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and then select an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

On the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, click
on the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and then
select the `↗️ (square

on the line of the first work order to be processed. Doing so opens a
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, with
details and processing options for the work order.

On the pop-up window, select the `Open Shop Floor`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button at the top-left of the window to open the *Shop
Floor* module.

![The Open Shop Floor button for a work order on a manufacturing order.](three_step_manufacturing/shop-floor-button.png){.align-center}

When accessed directly from a specific work order within an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, *Shop Floor*
defaults to the page for the work center where the work order is
configured to be carried out. The page shows a card for the work order
that displays the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} number, the product and number of units to be produced, and
the steps required to complete the work order.

![A work order card on a work center page in the Shop Floor module.](three_step_manufacturing/work-order-card.png){.align-center}

A work order is processed by completing each step listed on its card.
This can be done by clicking on a step, and following the instructions
listed on the pop-up window that appears. Once the step is completed,
click `Next`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to move on to the next
step, if any are required.

Alternatively, work order steps can be completed by clicking the
checkbox that appears on the right side of the step\'s line on the work
order card. When using this method, the step is automatically marked as
completed, without a pop-up window appearing.

The final step on a work order card is titled *Register Production*.
This step is used to register the number of product units that were
produced. If the number produced is equal to the number that the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} was created
for, click the `# Units`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on
the right side of the line to automatically register that number as the
quantity produced.

If a different number must be entered, click the
`Register Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} step to open a
pop-up window. Enter the number of units produced in the
`Units`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and then click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to register that number.

:::: note

The *Register Production* step appears on every work order card. It must
be completed for the first work order that is processed. After doing so,
the step appears as already completed for each remaining work order in
the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
::::

After completing all of the steps for a work order, a button appears on
the footer of the work order card. If any other work orders must be
completed before the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} can be closed, the button is titled
`Mark as Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If there are no
additional work orders to complete, the button is titled
`Close Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Clicking `Mark as Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} causes the
work order card to fade away. Once it disappears completely, the work
order\'s status is marked as *Finished* on the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and the next
work order appears in the *Shop Floor* module, on the page of the work
center where it is configured to be carried out. Any additional work
orders can be processed using the instructions detailed in this section.

Clicking `Close Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} causes
the work order card to fade away. Once it disappears, the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is marked as

# Two-step manufacturing

Odoo *Manufacturing* allows users to manufacture products using one,
two, or three steps. When using two-step manufacturing, Odoo creates a
manufacturing order (MO) and a pick components transfer, but does not
generate a transfer for the movement of finished products into stock.
Inventory counts still update based on the number of products
manufactured, but the act of transferring them to and from inventory is
not tracked.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The number of steps used in manufacturing is set at the warehouse level,
allowing for each warehouse to use a different number of steps. To
change the number of steps used for a specific warehouse, begin by
navigating to
`Inventory --> Configuration --> Warehouses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and then select a warehouse from the
`Warehouses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} screen.

On the `Warehouse Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
find the `Manufacture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} radio input
field, and select one of the three options:
`Manufacture (1 step)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Pick
components and then manufacture (2 steps)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Pick components, manufacture and then
store products (3 steps)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Products must be properly configured before they can be manufactured in
Odoo. For details on how to do so, see the documentation on how to
`configure a product for manufacturing
<manufacturing/management/configure-manufacturing-product>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

## Create manufacturing order

To manufacture a product in Odoo *Manufacturing*, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and then click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to create a new
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

On the new `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
select the product to be produced from the `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu. The
`Bill of Material`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
auto-populates with the associated Bill of Materials (BoM).

If a product has more than one [\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|) configured for
it, the specific [\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|) can be selected in the
`Bill of Material`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field auto-populates with
the associated product.

After a [\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|) has been selected, the
`Components`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tabs auto-populate with
the components and operations specified on the
[\|BOM\|](##SUBST##|BOM|). If additional components or operations are
required for the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text

# Allocation reports

When fulfilling sales orders (SOs), or sourcing components for
manufacturing orders (MOs), it is sometimes necessary to prioritize one
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} over another.
In situations where there is insufficient stock on-hand to fulfill every
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, ensuring that
products and components are reserved for priority orders is essential.

In Odoo *Manufacturing*, allocation reports are used on
`MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to assign
products to specific sales orders `SOs (sales orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, or components to specific
`MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. This
ensures the products or components are available for those orders, and
are not used by mistake.

## Configuration

To use allocation reports, the *Allocation Report for Manufacturing
Orders* feature **must** be enabled. To do so, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and tick the checkbox next to
`Allocation Report for Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

For products that are sold, it is also necessary to configure them so
they can be included in `SOs (sales orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. To do so, begin by navigating to
`Inventory --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a product. Under the
`Product Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the product
form, make sure that the `Can Be Sold`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox is ticked.

## Allocate products

To allocate products or components from an
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to an
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, or to a different
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, begin by
navigating to
`Manufacturing app --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
create a new `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

On the `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form,
select a product in the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, and specify the quantity to be produced in the
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Finally, click
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

The rest of the allocation workflow depends on the current on-hand
quantity of the product being manufactured, and whether or not there are
any `SOs (sales orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} which
require the product, but have not already been allocated units.

If there **are** existing `SOs (sales orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and `MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} that require the product, **and** there are too few units
of the product on-hand to fulfill those orders, then an
`fa-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Allocation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button appears at the top of the page as soon as
the `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
confirmed.

If there **are** existing `SOs (sales orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and `MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} that require the product, **and** there are enough units of
the product on-hand to fulfill those orders, then the
`fa-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Allocation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button only appears at the top of the page once
the `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} has been
marked as done, by clicking `Produce All`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If there **are not** any existing `SOs (sales orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and `MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} that require the product, the `fa-list`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button does not appear, even when the
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} has been
marked as done.
::::

Click the `fa-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button to open the
`MRP Reception
Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. This report
lists open delivery orders or
`MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, depending
on the type of product produced in the original
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

### Allocate to delivery order

If the `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
contains a finished product, the report lists any open delivery orders
for which quantities of the product have yet to be reserved.

::: example
An `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is created
to produce three units of a *rocking chair*. Clicking the
`Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button on the
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} opens an
allocation report that lists open delivery orders that require one or
more rocking chairs.
:::

Click the `Assign All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to the
right of a specific order to assign products for each quantity required
to fulfill that order.

::: example
If an order requires one quantity of four units of the product, and one
quantity of one unit of the product, clicking
`Assign All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} assigns five units of
the product to fulfill both quantities.
:::

Alternatively, click `Assign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} next to
a specific quantity to only assign products to that quantity, and not
any others in the order.

::: example
If an order requires one quantity of four units of the product, and one
quantity of one unit of the product, clicking `Assign`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} next to the quantity of one unit assigns a product to
that quantity, but leaves the quantity of four units without any
products assigned.
:::

![The MRP Reception Report for an MO containing finished products.](allocation/product-reception-report.png){.align-center}

### Allocate to MO

If the `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
contains a component, the report lists any open
`MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for which
quantities of the component have yet to be reserved.

::: example
An `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is created
to produce three units of *wood*, which is used as a component for the
*rocking chair* product. Clicking the `Allocation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button on the
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} opens an
allocation report that lists open rocking chair
`MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that require
one or more pieces of wood.
:::

Click the `Assign All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Assign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to the right of a
specific `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
assign components to that `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

![The MRP Reception Report for an MO containing components.](allocation/component-reception-report.png){.align-center}

### Unassign products

After assigning products to a quantity within a delivery order, or
components to an `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, the `Assign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
turns into an `Unassign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.
Click `Unassign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to unreserve the
assigned products from that quantity, making them available for other
quantities.

### Print labels

After clicking `Assign All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Assign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Print Labels`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Print Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to the right of
either button becomes selectable. Selecting either button generates and
downloads a PDF document with one label for each product that was
assigned. These labels are used to designate each product as being
reserved for that specific order.

# Delays

Odoo\'s *Manufacturing* app displays *delays* in manufacturing orders
through the `Delayed
Productions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter. If the
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}\'s end date
exceeds its deadline, the deadline is highlighted in red to draw
attention to the delay.

![The delayed production filter in Odoo.](delayed/delayed-filter.png)

## Deadline calculation

The `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} deadline
depends on how the `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} was created, and is calculated as follows:

- **Make To Order**: the `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} deadline is the *Sales Order Delivery Date*.
- **Replenishment**: the `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} deadline is *today + Manufacturing Lead Time*.
- **Manually created MO**: the deadline field remains empty.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} *deadline*
is not the same as the `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} *end date*.

The end date is computed as:

$$\text{End date} =
\text{Scheduled start date}
+\text{Total duration of all operations}$$
::::

## Filters

Several additional filters are available to help track delays:

- `Delayed Productions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}\'s
  *scheduled start date* is later than the deadline.
- `Late`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}\'s
  *scheduled end date* exceeds the deadline, highlighted in red.
- `Late Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: one or more
  required components are not available before the deadline. For
  example, a confirmed purchase order or manufacturing order for
  components is scheduled to end *after* the
  `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} deadline.
- `Components Available`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: all
  components are available to begin production.

## Use case

Consider an `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
with a deadline of **September 17th**:

- If production on the `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} starts after September 17th, it appears in the `Delayed
  Productions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter.
- If required components are scheduled to arrive after September 17th,
  the `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} appears
  in the `Late Availability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter.
- If the `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} has a
  scheduled end date after September 17th, it appears in the
  `Late`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter.

![An MO with the deadline emphasized.](delayed/deadline.png)

By combining these indicators, planners can quickly identify where
production is at risk of missing delivery commitments.

# Overall equipment effectiveness

In Odoo\'s *Manufacturing* app, *overall equipment effectiveness* (OEE)
represents the amount of time a work center is fully productive.
`OEE (overall equipment effectiveness)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
is displayed as a percentage of the total time a work center is active.

Fully productive time is considered to be time when the work center is
operational **and** processing work orders that have not exceeded their
*expected duration*.

`OEE (overall equipment effectiveness)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
helps manufacturing teams understand the efficiency of work centers, and
the causes of manufacturing downtime.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Since `OEE (overall equipment effectiveness)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} tracks work center productivity, using it requires enabling
the work centers feature in the settings of the Manufacturing app.

To do so, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and tick the checkbox next to
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, under the
`Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading. Then, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

## Efficiency standards

For `OEE (overall equipment effectiveness)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} to accurately reflect the percentage of fully productive
time for a work center, the work center **must** be properly configured
with the correct productivity metrics. These include the work center\'s
*time efficiency*, *capacity*, and *OEE target*.

### Time efficiency

Time efficiency represents the efficiency of a work center when
processing work orders, and is represented as a percentage. A time
efficiency value of 100% signifies that the work center processes work
orders at the speed of the expected duration, as listed on a product\'s
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. A value less
than or greater than 100% signifies that the work center processes work
orders slower or faster than an operation\'s expected duration,
respectively.

To set the time efficiency for a work center, navigate to
`Manufacturing app -->
Configuration --> Work Centers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and select a work center. On the `General Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, enter a numerical value in the
`Time Efficiency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

::: example
Manufacturing a *chair* product requires two operations: *cut* and
*assemble*. The product\'s `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} lists an expected duration of 30 minutes for each
operation.

The cut operation is carried out at the *cut station* work center, which
has a time efficiency value of 50%. This means it takes twice as long to
complete the operation, for a total time of one hour.

The assemble operation is carried out at the *assembly line* work
center, which has a time efficiency value of 200%. This means it takes
half as long to complete the operation, for a total time of 15 minutes.
:::

### Capacity

Capacity represents how many units of a product can be produced in
parallel at a work center. The duration of work orders for multiple
units increases or decreases, based on how many units the work center
can handle.

To set the capacity for a work center, navigate to
`Manufacturing app -->
Configuration --> Work Centers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and select a work center. On the `General Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, enter a numerical value in the
`Capacity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

::: example
A *drill station* work center has a capacity of one unit. An
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is confirmed
for 10 units of a *chair*, a product manufactured using the drill
station.

Since there are ten times as many units to produce than the work center
can handle at once, the operation time is ten times the duration listed
on the product\'s `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.
:::

### `OEE (overall equipment effectiveness)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} target {#oee-target}

The `OEE (overall equipment effectiveness)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} target is the goal for how much of a work center\'s
operating time should be fully productive time. It is displayed as a
percentage, and should only be set as high as [100%]{.title-ref}.

To set the `OEE (overall equipment effectiveness)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} target for a work center, navigate to
`Manufacturing app -->
Configuration --> Settings --> Work Centers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a work center. On the `General
Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, enter a numerical
value of [100.00]{.title-ref} or less in the
`OEE Target`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

## Calculating `OEE (overall equipment effectiveness)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} {#calculating-oee}

`OEE (overall equipment effectiveness)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
is represented as a percentage value between zero and 100. The value
signifies the amount of time that a work center was fully productive.
The remainder signifies the amount of time that the work center was
operating at less than full efficiency. This can occur for a number of
reasons, including *reduced speed*, *material availability*, and
*equipment failure*.

### Fully productive time

For a work center to be considered fully productive, it must be able to
receive work orders, have the components necessary to process work
orders, and be operating within the expected duration of the work order
it is processing.

::: example
An *assembly line* work center is not blocked, and receives a work order
to assemble a *bicycle*. The required components are available, so
production begins as soon as they are picked and delivered to the work
center. The work order has an expected duration of 30 minutes, and is
completed in 27 minutes. All of this time is considered fully productive
time.
:::

### Reduced speed

When a work center is operating at reduced speed, it means that it is
processing a work order that has exceeded its expected duration. While
the work center may be operational, this is not considered fully
productive time.

::: example
A *cutting station* work center receives a work order to cut boards for
a *table*. The expected duration of the work order is 15 minutes. The
work order ends up taking 18 minutes to complete. The work center is
considered to have been operating at reduced speed during the three
minutes that exceeded the expected duration.
:::

### Material availability

Material availability refers to situations where a work center is able
to accept a work order, but the required components are not available.
This can occur because the components are not in stock, or are reserved
for a different order.

::: example
Manufacturing of a *bench* requires 20 units of *wood*. A manufacturing
order (MO) is confirmed for 10 units of the bench, but there is not
enough wood in stock to begin manufacturing. The time it takes to
acquire the wood is recorded as material availability downtime.
:::

### Equipment failure

Equipment failure signifies any period of time when a work center is
unusable due to maintenance issues with its equipment. This can be due
to equipment breaking down, or when a work center is shut down for
scheduled maintenance. In these cases, a work center can be blocked
using a
`maintenance request <../../maintenance/maintenance_requests>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

::: example
The drill at a *drill station* work center breaks down, causing the work
center to be unusable. A maintenance request is created to fix the
drill, and the work center is blocked from receiving work orders. It
takes two hours to fix the drill, and make the work center available
again. This two-hour period is recorded as equipment failure downtime.
:::

## `OEE (overall equipment effectiveness)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} reporting {#oee-reporting}

To view `OEE (overall equipment effectiveness)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} reporting metrics for every work center, navigate to
`Manufacturing app
--> Reporting --> Overall Equipment Effectiveness`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. This page shows the metrics for each work center
with `OEE (overall equipment effectiveness)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} data.

Alternatively, to see
`OEE (overall equipment effectiveness)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
reporting metrics for a single work center, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Configuration --> Work Centers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a work center. At the top of the work
center\'s form, click the `fa-pie-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`OEE`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button.

By default, the main
`OEE (overall equipment effectiveness)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
reporting page shows data in a bar chart, while the page for a specific
work center shows it in a pie chart. To select a different chart type on
either page, click the `fa-bar-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(bar chart)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`fa-line-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(line chart)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`fa-pie-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(pie chart)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button above the
displayed chart.

It is also possible to see
`OEE (overall equipment effectiveness)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
data in a pivot view, or a list displaying each time entry, by clicking
the `oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(pivot view)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`oi-view-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(list
view)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons at the top-right
corner of the page.

# Production analysis

The *Production Analysis* report provides statistics about products
manufactured using Odoo\'s *Manufacturing* app. The report is useful
when trying to understand production costs, manufacturing durations, and
other important statistics about manufactured products.

To open the Production Analysis report, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Reporting
--> Production Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Production Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report is
one of many reports available across the Odoo app suite. This
documentation only covers the measures specific to the `Production
Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report, along with a few
use case examples.

For a full overview of the basic features available in most Odoo
reports, see the documentation on
`reporting essentials <../../../essentials/reporting>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
::::

## Measures

*Measures* are the datasets that can be selected in the
`Production Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report. Each
dataset represents a specific statistic about
`MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in the
database. Choose a measure by clicking the `Measures`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} button,
and selecting one of the options from the drop-down menu:

The options displayed in the `Measures`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
drop-down menu, and the order they appear in, differ depending on the
filters, groupings, and comparisons enabled in the
`Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar. By default, the
available measures appear as follows:

- `Average Employee Cost/Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  average cost paid to employees to produce one unit of the product.
- `By-Products Total Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total
  value of all by-products created by manufacturing the product.
- `Component Cost/Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the average
  cost of the components required to produce one unit of the product.
- `Cost/Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the average cost of
  producing one unit of the product, including component, employee,
  operation, and subcontracting costs.
- `Duration of Operations/Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  average total duration of operations required to produce one unit of
  the product.
- `Quantity Demanded`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total
  number of units of the product included in
  `MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
- `Quantity Produced`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total
  number of units of the product that have actually been produced.
- `Total Component Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total
  amount spent on the product\'s components, across every
  `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the
  product.
- `Total Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total amount
  spent manufacturing every unit of the product produced so far.
- `Total Duration of Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  cumulative duration of every operation completed while manufacturing
  the product.
- `Total Employee Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  cumulative amount paid to employees to manufacture the product.
- `Total Operation Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  cumulative amount spent on operations required to produce the product.
- `Total Operation Cost/Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  average cost of the operations required to produce one unit of the
  product.
- `Total Subcontracting Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  cumulative amount paid to subcontractors to produce the product.
- `Total Subcontracting Cost/Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  the average cost of engaging a subcontractor to produce one unit of
  the product.
- `Yield Percentage (%)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total
  quantity of the product produced versus the total quantity demanded,
  represented as a percentage.
- `Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total count of
  `MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} created
  for the product.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Only one measure can be selected at a time when one of the
`fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(graph view)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options is enabled.
However, multiple measures, and varying group-by criteria (on the x and
y axes), can be selected when using the
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(pivot table)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

## Use case: compare products

One of the best uses for the `Production Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} report is comparing statistics about two or more
products. This is accomplished by entering the products into the
`Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar, then selecting the
necessary measure, filter, and grouping, to see the desired data.

::: example
Toy manufacturer *Tommy\'s Toys* is trying to reduce their manufacturing
operation costs. To accomplish this, they have decided to identify
redundant products and cease manufacturing the ones with higher
operational costs.

Two of the toys that have been singled out for analysis are the *pogo
stick* and *moon shoes*. Tommy\'s Toys believes these two toys are so
similar that they can stop manufacturing one, without significantly
impacting their product offering.

To compare operation costs for the toys, business analyst Mike opens the
`Manufacturing`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, and
navigates to the `Production Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page. In the `Search...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} bar, he enters the names of both products. Then, he
opens the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar drop-down
menu, and clicks `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Group
By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

Below the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar, Mike
clicks on the `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} drop-down menu, and
selects the `Total Operation Cost/Unit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option. Finally, he selects the
`fa-bar-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(bar chart)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} graph type.

With these options selected, the `Production Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} report shows a bar chart for the current year, with one
bar for each product, signifying the average operation cost for one unit
of the product.

With this data, Mike is able to see that the average operation cost for
the moon shoes is almost twice the cost of the pogo stick. Using this
insight, Tommy\'s Toys decides to cease production of moon shoes, thus
lowering their average cost of manufacturing operations.

![The bar chart comparing the operation costs of the pogo stick and moon shoes.](production_analysis/use-case.png){.align-center}
:::

## Use case: compare time periods

The `Production Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report can
also be used to compare data for two different time periods. This is
accomplished using the options in the `Comparison`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section of the `Search...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} bar.

::::::: example
Furniture company *Fanny\'s Furnishings* wants to compare their
production costs for the first and second quarters of 2024, to see which
products they spent the most money producing in each quarter.

To compare the two time periods, shop floor supervisor Adam opens the
`Manufacturing`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, and
navigates to the `Production Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page. He begins by selecting the
`fa-pie-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(pie chart)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} graph type option at
the top of the page.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Comparison`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature is meant to
be used with the `fa-pie-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(pie chart)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} graph type, or the
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view.

A `Comparison`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option can still be
selected with the other view types enabled, but doing so does not change
the way data is displayed on the report.
::::

Next, Adam selects the `Total Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option from the `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} drop-down menu. This
option displays the total amount spent producing each product.

In the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar drop-down
menu, he leaves the `2024`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter
enabled in the `End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
and enables the `Q2`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter as well.
With both of these time periods selected, the pie chart shows data for
the second quarter of 2024.

Finally, Adam selects the `End Date: Previous Period`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option in the `Comparison`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section of the `Search...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} bar. Doing so causes the pie chart to be split into an
inner circle, and an outer ring.

The outer ring shows data for the selected time period, quarter two of
2024. The inner circle shows data for the previous time period, quarter
one of 2024.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If `End Date: Previous Year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
selected instead of `End Date: Previous
Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the inner circle shows data
for the selected time period, one *year* previous.

In the case of this example, it would show data for quarter two of 2023.
::::

Using this report, Adam can see that the products with the highest total
cost for quarter two are the *bicycle* and *tricycle*. On the other
hand, in quarter one, the *roller skates* had the highest total cost.

manufacturing orders (MOs) and work orders. It also allows manufacturing
employees to track the amount of time spent working on manufacturing and
work orders.

The *Shop Floor* module is installed alongside the *Manufacturing* app.
It cannot be installed by itself. To install the *Manufacturing* app,
navigate to `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, search for
[manufacturing]{.title-ref} in the `Search...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} bar, and then click `Install`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the `Manufacturing`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} app card.

:::: important

:::

The *Shop Floor* module replaces the tablet view functionality of the
*Manufacturing* app, and is only available in Odoo versions 16.4 and
later.

To check the version number of an Odoo database, navigate to
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and scroll down to
the `About`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section at the bottom of
the page. The version number is displayed there.

To switch to a newer version of Odoo, see the documentation on
`upgrading a database
<../../../../administration/upgrade>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
::::

## Navigation

*Shop Floor* is broken down into three main views, which can be selected
from the navigation bar at the top of the module:

- The `All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page serves as the main
  dashboard for the module, and displays information cards for
  `MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
- Each work center also has a dedicated page, which shows information
  cards for work orders assigned to that work center. Work center pages
  can be toggled on or off by clicking the `+
  (plus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the navigation
  bar, selecting or deselecting them on the pop-up window that appears,
  and then clicking `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- The `My`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page shows information
  cards for all work orders assigned to the employee whose profile is
  currently active in the operator panel on the left side of the module.
  Other than only showing work orders assigned to the active employee,
  this page functions the same as the pages for each work center.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To isolate an [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) or work order, so that no other
orders appear, simply search the reference number of the
[\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) in the `Search...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} bar at the top of the module. This search filter
remains active while switching between the different module views.
::::

On the left side of the module is the operator panel, which shows all of
the employees currently signed in to *Shop Floor*, and allows new
employees to sign in. The operator panel is always available in the
module, regardless of which view is selected. It can be toggled on or
off by clicking the `sidebar`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
at the extreme left of the navigation bar.

![The \"sidebar\" button, which is used to toggle the operator panel on or off.](shop_floor_overview/sidebar-button.png){.align-center}

### All page

By default, the `All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page shows an
information card for every [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) that is *ready to
start*. An [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) is considered ready to start once it
has been confirmed, and all required components are available.

To view every confirmed [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) regardless of readiness,
click the `x`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
`Ready to Start`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter to remove it
from the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar.

#### MO information card

An [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) information card on the
`All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page shows all of the relevant
details of the associated [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|), and also provides
employees with options for processing the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|).

The header for an [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) card shows the
[\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) number, the product and number of units being
produced, and the status of the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|). If work has not
yet begun on the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|), the status appears as
`Confirmed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Once work has begun, the
status updates to `In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If
all work orders for an [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) have been completed and
the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) is ready to close, the status updates to
`To Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The main body of an [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) card shows a line for each
completed work order, if any, followed by the current work order that
needs to be completed. Completed work orders are indicated by a green
check mark to the right of title of the work order. The current work
order is indicated by a button that opens the page for the work center
to which the order is assigned.

Below the current work order is a line titled
`Register Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which is used
to record the number of product units produced. To manually enter the
number of units produced, click on the
`Register Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line, enter a
value in the `Units`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field of the
resulting pop-up window, then click `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Alternatively, click the `# Units`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button on the right side of the line, which automatically records the
number of units the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) was created for as the
number of units produced. For example, if an [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) is
created for 10 units of a dining table, clicking the
`10 units`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button records that 10
units were produced.

The footer of the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) card displays a
`Close Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. This is
used to close the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) once production is completed.
However, if there are any quality checks required for the
[\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) as a whole (not the work orders within it), a
`Quality Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button appears
instead. Clicking `Quality Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
opens a pop-up window, from which any required quality checks can be
completed.

After clicking `Close Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) card begins to fade away, and an
`Undo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button appears on the footer.
Clicking `Undo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} causes the
[\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) to remain open. Once the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|)
card disappears completely, the work order is closed.

On the right side of the footer is an `⋮ (options)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, which opens a pop-up window with additional
options for the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|):

- `Scrap`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is used to send components
  to a scrap location when they are found to be defective.
- `Add Work Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is used to add an
  additional work order to the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|).
- `Add Component`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is used to add an
  additional component to the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|).
- `Open Backend MO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} opens the
  [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) in the Manufacturing app.

![An information card for an MO on the \"All\" page of the Shop Floor module.](shop_floor_overview/mo-card.png){.align-center}

### Work center pages

By default, the page for each work center shows an information card for
every work order assigned to it that is *ready to start*. A work order
is considered ready to start once the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) it is a
part of is ready to start, and any preceding work orders have been
completed.

To view every confirmed work order assigned to a work center regardless
of readiness, click the `x`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on
the `Ready to Start`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter to remove
it from the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar.

#### Work order information card

A work order information card on a work center\'s page shows all of the
relevant details of the associated work order, and also provides
employees with options for processing the work order.

The header for a work order card shows the reference number of the
[\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) that the work order is a part of, the product
and number of units being produced, and the status of the work order. If
work has not yet begun on the work order, the status appears as
`To Do`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Once work has begun, the
status updates to display a timer showing the total time the work order
has been worked on.

The main body of a work order card shows a line for each step required
to complete the work order. Work order steps can be completed by
clicking on the line, then following the instructions on the pop-up
window that appears. Alternatively, clicking the checkbox on the right
side of each line automatically marks the step as completed.

Below the final step of the work order is a line titled
`Register Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which
functions the same as the `Register Production`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} line on an [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) card. Registering
the number of units produced using the
`Register Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line on a work
order card also completes the step for the associated
[\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) card.

If the work order being processed is the final work order for the
[\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|), a `Close
Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button appears on the
footer of the work order card. Clicking `Close
Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} closes both the work
order and the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|), unless a quality check is
required for the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|). In this case, the quality
check must be completed from the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) card before the
[\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) can be closed.

Alternatively, if the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) requires the completion of
additional work orders, a `Mark as
Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button appears instead.
Clicking `Mark as Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} marks the
current work order as completed, and causes the next work order to
appear on the page for the work center it is assigned to.

After clicking `Close Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Mark as Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the work order card
begins to fade away, and an `Undo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button appears on the footer. Clicking `Undo`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} causes the work order to remain open. Once the work
order card disappears completely, the work order is marked as
`Finished`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
[\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|).

On the right side of the footer is an `⋮ (options)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, which opens a pop-up window with additional
options for the work order:

- `Scrap`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is used to send components
  to a scrap location when they are found to be defective.
- `Add Component`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is used to add an
  additional component to the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|).
- `Move to work center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is used to
  transfer the work order to a different work center.
- `Suggest a Worksheet improvement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  allows the user to propose a change to the work order\'s instructions
  or steps.
- `Create a Quality Alert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} opens a
  quality alert form that can be filled out to alert a quality team
  about a potential issue.

![An information card for a work order in the Shop Floor module.](shop_floor_overview/wo-card.png){.align-center}

### Operator panel

The operator panel is used to manage the employees that are signed in to
the *Shop Floor* module. The panel shows the name and profile picture of
every employee that is currently signed in across all instances of the
database.

To interact with *Shop Floor* as a specific employee, click the
employee\'s name to activate their profile. Profiles that are not active
appear with their names and profile pictures greyed-out.

When an employee is selected in the operator panel, they can begin
working on a work order by clicking the work order\'s heading. If an
employee is working on one or more work orders, the work order title(s)
appear under their name, along with a timer showing how long they\'ve
been working on each order.

To add a new employee to the operator panel, click the
`+ Add Operator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the bottom
of the panel. Then, select an employee from the
`Select Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

To remove an employee from the operator panel, simply click the
`x`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to their name in the
panel.

![The operator panel of the Shop Floor module, showing three employees signed in.](shop_floor_overview/operator-panel.png){.align-center}

## MO/WO prioritization

The **Shop Floor** module uses the *scheduled date* entered on
`MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
prioritize the `MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and work orders that appear on the module\'s dashboard and
work center pages. `MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and work orders scheduled sooner are more highly
prioritized, and appear before orders which are scheduled further out.

To specify the scheduled date on an [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|), begin by
navigating to `Manufacturing app
--> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to create a new [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|).

Click on the `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
to open a calendar popover window. By default, the
`Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and its
corresponding pop-up window, show the current date and time.

Use the calendar to select the date on which processing should begin for
the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|). In the two fields at the bottom of the
popover window, enter the hour and minute at which processing should
begin, using the 24-hour clock format.

Finally, click `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the bottom
of the popover window to set the date and time for the
`Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Then, click
the `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top of
the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) to confirm it.

Once the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) is confirmed, it appears in the **Shop
Floor** module, as long is it has the `Ready`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} status, which means all components are available.

On the Odoo dashboard, click on the `Shop Floor`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} module to open it. The
`All MO #`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page of the dashboard
displays *Ready* `MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, organized in order of their scheduled dates.

At the top of the module, select a work center to see the work orders
assigned to it. The page for each work center organizes work orders,
based on the scheduled dates of their corresponding
`MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

::: example
Three `MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are
confirmed for a *Bookcase* product:

- WH/MO/00411 has a `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  of August 16th.
- WH/MO/00412 has a `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  of August 20th.
- WH/MO/00413 has a `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  of August 18th.

On the `All MO #`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page of the **Shop
Floor** module, the cards for each [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) appear in
this order: WH/MO/00411, WH/MO/00413, WH/MO/00412.

![MOs in the Shop Floor module, ordered by their scheduled date.](shop_floor_overview/mo-order.png){.align-center}

Each [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) requires one work order, carried out at
`Assembly Station 1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Clicking on the
`Assembly Station 1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the
top of the screen opens the page for the work center, which displays one
card for each work order, appearing in the same order as their
corresponding `MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

# Shop Floor time tracking

By signing in to the Odoo *Shop Floor* module as *operators*, employees
are able to track the amount of time they spend working on each work
order.

Odoo tracks the time it takes to complete each work order, as well as
the time each operator spends on each work order.

## Operator sign in

To sign in to the *Shop Floor* module as an operator, sign in to the
Odoo database, and open the `Shop Floor`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} module. The employee profile that is signed in to
the database is automatically signed in as an operator.

All active operators are listed in the operator panel on the left side
of the module. The panel can be opened or collapsed by clicking the
`show/hide panel (white square with black column on
left side)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, located in the
top-left corner of the module.

![The operator panel in the Shop Floor module, with the show/hide panel button above it.](shop_floor_tracking/operator-panel.png){.align-center}

To sign in to *Shop Floor* as a different employee, click the
`+ Add Operator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the bottom
of the panel. Doing so opens the `Select Employee`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window, which lists every employee that is able
to sign in to the module.

Click on a specific employee to sign in using their profile. If no PIN
code is required to sign in as that employee, the profile will be signed
in automatically.

If a PIN code is required, a `Password?`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears, showing a number pad, from which
the code can be entered. Enter the code using the number pad, and click
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to sign in to the *Shop
Floor* module.

![The \"Password?\" pop-up window, which is used to enter an operator PIN code.](shop_floor_tracking/pin-code.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

A PIN code can be set for each employee, which must be entered each time
they sign in to the *Shop Floor* module, check in or out in the *Kiosk
Mode* of the *Attendances* application, or sign in as a cashier in the
*Point of Sale* application.

To set an employee PIN, navigate to the `Employees`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} app, and select a specific employee. At the bottom
of the employee\'s form, click on the `HR Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and enter a numerical code in the
`PIN Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
::::

Once an employee is signed in to the module, their name appears in the
operator panel, along with every other employee that has signed in.
While the panel can list multiple employees, only one employee can be
active at any given time, on a single instance of the *Shop Floor*
module.

Click on an employee\'s name to make their profile active. The active
employee appears highlighted in blue, while employees that are signed
in, but not active, have their names faded out.

To sign out a specific employee from the module, click the
`X (remove)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to their
name, in the operator panel.

## Track work order duration

To track time spent working on a work order, begin by selecting the
employee working on it from the operator panel.

Next, navigate to the page for the work center where the work order is
scheduled to be carried out. This can be done by selecting the work
center from the top navigation in the *Shop Floor* module, or by
clicking the name of the work center on the card for the manufacturing
order (MO) that the work order is a part of.

On the page for the work center, find the card for the work order. Once
work begins, click the header of the work order card to start timing the
duration it takes to complete. This duration is displayed by a timer on
the header of the work order card, which tracks the collective time
spent working on the work order, by all employees.

![A work order card with an active timer.](shop_floor_tracking/work-order-timer.png){.align-center}

In addition, the reference number of the work order appears in the
operator panel, under the name of the employee working on it, along with
a second timer, which tracks the amount of time the employee has spent
on the work order individually. This timer only reflects work done
during the current session, even if the employee has previously worked
on the work order.

Employees are able to work on multiple work orders simultaneously, and
track their time for each. The reference number for each work order
being worked on appears below the employee\'s name, along with a timer.

![An employee card in the operator panel, showing two work order timers.](shop_floor_tracking/employee-timer.png){.align-center}

To pause the timer on the work order card, and remove the work order
from below the employee\'s name on the operator panel, click the header
a second time.

Once the work order is completed, click the
`Mark as Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the bottom
of the work order card, which causes the card to fade away. If the timer
is still active, it stops once the card disappears completely.

## View work order duration

To view the duration of a work order, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Operations
--> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
select an `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

To view and select `MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} that have been completed and marked as *Done*, remove the
`To Do`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter from the
`Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar, by clicking on the
`X (close)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the right side
of the filter.

On the page for the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, click on the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab to see a list of all work orders included in the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. The time it
took to complete each work order is displayed in the
`Real Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column of the tab.

The *Real Duration* represents the total time spent working on the work
order by all workers who worked on it. It includes time tracked in the
*Shop Floor* module, as well as time tracked on the
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} itself.

# Basic subcontracting lead times

In Odoo, lead times are used to predict how long it takes to complete a
certain action. For example, a *delivery lead time* can be set for a
purchased product, which specifies the number of days it usually takes
for the product\'s vendor to delivery the product to the purchasing
company.

For subcontracted products specifically, delivery lead times can be
configured to take into account the amount of time required for the
subcontractor to manufacture a product. Doing so allows the contracting
company to better predict the delivery dates of subcontracted products.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Like all lead times in Odoo, lead times for subcontracted products are
only an estimate, and are based on how long actions are *expected* to
take.

Unforeseen circumstances can impact the completion of these actions,
which means that lead times should not be viewed as guarantees.
::::

## Configuration

When using the
`basic subcontracting <subcontracting_basic>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} workflow to manufacture a product, a company is not
responsible for supplying the subcontractor with the necessary
components. This means that the only factors affecting the delivery date
of a product are the amount of time it takes the subcontractor to
manufacture and deliver it.

By assigning a product\'s subcontractor a delivery lead time that
considers both of these factors, the *Expected Arrival* date displayed
on purchase orders (POs) for the product more accurately reflects the
amount of time required for both manufacturing and delivery.

### Product delivery lead time

To set a delivery lead time for a product\'s subcontractor, navigate to
`Inventory app
--> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
select a subcontracted product.

Then, select the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on
the product\'s page. If the subcontractor has not already been added as
a vendor, do so now by clicking `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and selecting the subcontractor in the
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

Once the subcontractor has been added, enter the number of days it takes
them to manufacture and deliver the product, in the
`Delivery Lead Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

![The Delivery Lead Time field for a subcontractor, on the Purchase tab of a product page.](basic_subcontracting_lead_times/delivery-lead-time.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Multiple subcontractors can be added to the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab on a product\'s page, and a different
`Delivery Lead Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be set for
each.
::::

## Lead time workflow

After setting a delivery lead time for a product\'s vendor, create an
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by
navigating to
`Purchase app --> Orders --> Purchase Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and clicking `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Specify the subcontractor in the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. Then, add the product in the
`Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab by clicking
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, selecting the
product in the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, and
adding a quantity in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column.

Once a product has been added, the `Expected Arrival`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field on the
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
auto-populates with a date that reflects the vendor\'s delivery lead
time, as specified on the product\'s page.

If the date needs to be adjusted, click on the
`Expected Arrival`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to open a
calendar popover, and select the desired date. Make sure not to choose a
date sooner than the one that was auto-populated, unless the
subcontractor has confirmed that they are able to deliver the product by
that date.

Finally, click `Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to turn it
into a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. At this
point, the subcontractor should begin manufacturing the subcontracted
product, before delivering it to the contracting company.

::: example
Bike retailer *Mike\'s Bikes* works with a subcontractor --- *Bike
Friends* --- to produce units of their *Tricycle* product.

On average, Bike Friends requires three days to manufacture a tricycle,
plus an additional two days to deliver it to Mike\'s Bikes.

As a result, Mike\'s Bikes sets a delivery lead time of five days for
tricycles manufactured by Bike Friends: three days for manufacturing,
plus two days for delivery.

On May 3rd, Mike\'s Bikes confirms a
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to purchase one
tricycle from Bike Friends.

The `Expected Arrival`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} date listed on
the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is May 8th,
five days after the `Confirmation Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![The Expected Arrival date on a PO for a subcontracted product.](basic_subcontracting_lead_times/expected-arrival.png){.align-center}

Bike Friends begins manufacturing the tricycle on May 3rd --- the day
that the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
confirmed --- and finishes on May 6th, three days later.

The tricycle is then shipped to Mike\'s Bikes the same day, and they
receive it on May 8th, two days later.

# Dropship subcontracting lead times

In Odoo, lead times are used to predict how long it takes to complete a
certain action. For example, a *delivery lead time* can be set for a
purchased product, which specifies the number of days it usually takes
for the product\'s vendor to deliver the product to the purchasing
company.

For subcontracted products specifically, delivery lead times can be
configured to take into account the amount of time required for the
subcontractor to manufacture a product. Doing so allows the contracting
company to better predict the delivery dates of subcontracted products.

Certain subcontracted products require the contracting company to supply
the subcontractor with manufacturing components. In this case, a
*manufacturing lead time* can be used, in addition to the delivery lead
time, to generate the date on which the subcontractor must receive the
required components, in order to manufacture the product and deliver it
on time.

In cases where components are dropshipped to the subcontractor, an
additional delivery lead time can be set for each component. This should
be set to the amount of time it takes the vendor to deliver components
to the subcontractor.

Once a delivery lead time has been set on a component, dropship orders
for the component display the date by which the order must be confirmed,
so that it can be dropshipped to the subcontractor by the date on which
manufacturing must begin.

Like all lead times in Odoo, lead times for subcontracted products are
only an estimate, and are based on how long actions are *expected* to
take.

Unforeseen circumstances can impact the completion of these actions,
which means that lead times should not be viewed as guarantees.
::::

## Configuration

When using the
`Dropship Subcontractor on Order <subcontracting_dropship>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} route, a company is responsible for purchasing the necessary
components from a vendor, and having them dropshipped directly to the
subcontractor.

This means that, in addition to the amount of time it takes the
subcontractor to manufacture and deliver the product, it is also
necessary to consider how long it takes the component vendor to dropship
the components to the subcontractor.

By assigning a product\'s subcontractor a *delivery lead time*,
specifying a *manufacturing lead time* on the product\'s BoM, and
assigning the vendor of the components an additional *delivery lead
time*, *Dropship Subcontractor* orders for the product\'s components
display the deadline for confirming a dropship order to send the
components to the subcontractor.

### Product delivery lead time

To set a delivery lead time for a product\'s subcontractor, navigate to
`Inventory app -->
Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select a
subcontracted product.

Then, select the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on
the product\'s page. If the subcontractor has not already been added as
a vendor, do so now by clicking `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and selecting the subcontractor in the
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

Once the subcontractor has been added, enter the number of days it takes
them to manufacture and deliver the product, in the
`Delivery Lead Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

![The Delivery Lead Time field for a subcontractor, on the Purchase tab of a product page.](dropship_subcontracting_lead_times/delivery-lead-time.png){.align-center}

### Product manufacturing lead time

Next, navigate to the product\'s
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by clicking the
`Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at
the top of the product\'s page. Then, select a BoM from the list.

On the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, select
the `Miscellaneous`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. In the
`Manuf. Lead Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, enter the
same number of days that was entered in the
`Delivery Lead Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field of the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}\'s product.

![The Manuf. Lead Time field on a product\'s BoM.](dropship_subcontracting_lead_times/manufacturing-lead-time.png){.align-center}

While not all of these days are actually used for manufacturing by the
subcontractor, setting the same number of days in each field tells Odoo
that the subcontractor must receive the components and begin production
by the start of the product\'s delivery lead time. This gives the
subcontractor enough time to both manufacture and deliver the product.

### Component delivery lead time

From the product\'s BoM, navigate to each component by clicking on the
component in the `Components`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
and then clicking the `oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(right arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to the right
of the component.

On the product page for each component, select the
`Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. If the vendor has not
already been added, do so now by clicking `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and selecting the subcontractor in the
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

Once the vendor has been added, enter the number of days it takes them
to dropship the product to the subcontractor, in the
`Delivery Lead Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

## Dropship subcontracting workflow

Create a request for quotation (RfQ) for the product by navigating to
`Purchase app
--> Orders --> Requests for Quotation`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and clicking `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Specify the subcontractor in `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. Then, add the product in the `Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab by clicking `Add a product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, selecting the product in the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, and specifying a
quantity in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

In the `Expected Arrival`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
enter a date that provides enough time for the component vendor to
dropship the components, and the subcontractor to manufacture and
deliver the product.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When a product is added to an
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
`Expected Arrival`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
auto-populates with a date that is today\'s date plus the delivery lead
time of the product. However, this does not consider the time it takes
to dropship the components to the subcontractor.

When purchasing a product subcontracted using the *Dropship
Subcontractor on Order* route, it is necessary to adjust this date to
take into account the extra time needed for the components to be
delivered to the subcontractor.

Since production does not begin until they receive the components,
leaving the date as is results in the finished product arriving *after*
the date listed on the `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.
::::

Next, click `Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to turn
the `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} into a
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Doing so creates a
second `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
purchase the components from the dropshipper, and have them sent to the
subcontractor.

Navigate to
`Purchase app --> Orders --> Requests for Quotation`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that lists
the dropshipper in the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column.

On the `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
`Expected Arrival`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field lists the
date on which the subcontractor must receive the components, in order to
deliver the finished product by the *Expected Arrival* date listed on
the subcontractor `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

The `Order Deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field lists the
latest date on which the `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} can be confirmed, in order for the dropshipper to deliver
the components to the subcontractor by the `Expected
Arrival`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} date.

Click `Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to turn the
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} into a
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and confirm the
purchase of the components from the dropshipper. Doing so causes a
`Dropship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button to appear at
the top of the page.

Click the `Dropship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button to
open the dropship order. This order can also be accessed from the
`Resupply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button that now
appears on the subcontractor `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

After the dropshipper has delivered the components to the subcontractor,
click the `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the
top of the dropship order to confirm that the subcontractor has received
the components.

Once the subcontractor receives the components, they begin manufacturing
the component, before delivering it to the contracting company.

::: example
Bike retailer *Mike\'s Bikes* works with a subcontractor --- *Bike
Friends* --- to produce units of their *Bicycle* product.

Mike\'s Bikes must purchase the required components from vendor Bike
World, and have them dropshipped to Bike Friends.

On average, Bike Friends takes three days to manufacture each bicycle,
plus an addition two days to deliver it to Mike\'s Bikes.

As a result, Mike\'s Bikes sets a delivery lead time of five days for
bicycle manufactured by Bike Friends: three days for manufacturing, plus
two days for delivery.

On the bicycle\'s BoM, they enter a manufacturing lead time of five days
as well, to remind themselves of the date that components must be
delivered to the subcontractor.

On the product pages for each of the bicycle\'s components, they assign
Bike World a delivery lead time of two days. This is the amount of time
it takes Bike World to dropship each component directly to the
subcontractor.

On May 10th, Mike\'s Bikes confirms a
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for one bicycle,
with an expected delivery date of May 17th.

The `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for
purchasing the components from Bike World and having them dropshipped to
Bike Friends has an Expected Arrival date of May 12th, and a Deadline of
May 10th. The `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} must be confirmed by the deadline in order for Bike Friends
to receive the components by the Expected Arrival date, giving them
enough time to deliver the finished bicycle to Mike\'s Bikes by May
17th.

![The Order Deadline and Expected Arrival dates on a dropship order.](dropship_subcontracting_lead_times/deadline-arrival.png){.align-center}

Mike\'s Bikes confirms the
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} on May
10th, and Bike World delivers the components to Bike Friends on May
12th. Bike Friends manufactures the bicycle, and delivers it to Mike\'s
Bikes on May 17th.

# Resupply subcontracting lead times

In Odoo, lead times are used to predict how long it takes to complete a
certain action. For example, a *delivery lead time* can be set for a
purchased product, which specifies the number of days it usually takes
for the product\'s vendor to deliver the product to the purchasing
company.

For subcontracted products specifically, delivery lead times can be
configured to take into account the amount of time required for the
subcontractor to manufacture a product. Doing so allows the contracting
company to better predict the delivery dates of subcontracted products.

Certain subcontracted products require the contracting company to supply
the subcontractor with manufacturing components. In this case, a
*manufacturing lead time* can be used, in addition to the delivery lead
time, to generate the date on which the subcontractor must receive the
required components, in order to manufacture the product and deliver it
on time.

:::: important

## Configuration

When using the
`Resupply Subcontractor on Order <subcontracting_resupply>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} route, a company is responsible for supplying the
subcontractor with the necessary components. As a result, the
subcontractor cannot begin manufacturing until the components have been
received.

This means that, in addition to the amount of time it takes the
subcontractor to manufacture and deliver the product, the date they
receive the components must also be considered.

By assigning a product\'s subcontractor a delivery lead time, and
specifying a manufacturing lead time on the product\'s bill of materials
(BoM), *Resupply Subcontractor* orders for the product\'s components
display the deadline by which the subcontractor must receive the
components.

### Product delivery lead time

To set a delivery lead time for a product\'s subcontractor, navigate to
`Inventory app
--> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
select a subcontracted product.

Then, select the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on
the product\'s page. If the subcontractor has not already been added as
a vendor, do so now by clicking `Add a line`{.interpreted-text

`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Once the subcontractor has been added, enter the number of days it takes
them to manufacture and deliver the product, in the
`Delivery Lead Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

![The Delivery Lead Time field for a subcontractor, on the Purchase tab of a product page.](resupply_subcontracting_lead_times/delivery-lead-time.png){.align-center}

### Product manufacturing lead time

Next, navigate to the product\'s
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by clicking the
`Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at
the top of the product\'s page. Then, select a
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} from the list.

On the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, select
the `Miscellaneous`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. In the
`Manuf. Lead Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, enter the
same number of days that was entered in the
`Delivery Lead Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field of the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}\'s product.

![The Manuf. Lead Time field on a product\'s BoM.](resupply_subcontracting_lead_times/manufacturing-lead-time.png){.align-center}

While not all of these days are actually used for manufacturing by the
subcontractor, setting the same number of days in each field tells Odoo
that the subcontractor must receive the components and begin production
by the start of the product\'s delivery lead time. This gives the
subcontractor enough time to both manufacture and deliver the product.

### Resupply subcontracting workflow

Create a request for quotation (RfQ) for the product by navigating to

Click the `Resupply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button to
open the resupply subcontractor order, which is the order created to
send components to the subcontractor.

The `Deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the resupply
subcontractor order shows the deadline for the subcontractor to receive
the components, in order for them to have enough time to manufacture and
deliver the finished product by the Expected Arrival date.

The `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field should

The resupply subcontractor order for shipping the components to the
subcontractor shows a *Deadline* of May 25th. The subcontractor must
receive the components by this date, in order to have enough time to
manufacture the unicycle, and deliver it by May 30th.

It takes Mike\'s Bikes two days to deliver the components, so they
update the *Scheduled Date* field on the resupply subcontractor order to
May 23rd, two days before the Deadline.

# Basic subcontracting

In manufacturing, subcontracting is the process of a company engaging a
third-party manufacturer, or subcontractor, to manufacture products that
are then sold by the contracting company.

In basic subcontracting, the subcontractor is responsible for acquiring
the necessary components. This means that the contracting company only
has to worry about what happens to subcontracted products once they are
produced.

The workflow for purchasing a product manufactured using basic
subcontracting is similar to the one used when purchasing a
non-subcontracted product from a vendor. The main differences are the
way that subcontracted products are configured, and the fact that
subcontracted products take longer to be sent from the vendor, since
they must first be manufactured by them.

## Configuration

To use subcontracting in Odoo, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and tick the checkbox
next to the `Subcontracting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting,
under the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading. Then,
click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Once the `Subcontracting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting is
enabled, it is also necessary to properly configure the subcontracted
product, and the product\'s `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

### Configure product {#manufacturing/workflows/subcontracting_basic/product-config}

To configure a product for basic subcontracting, navigate to
`Inventory app -->
Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
select a product, or create a new one by clicking
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

On the product form, select the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and add the product\'s subcontractor as a vendor
by clicking `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, selecting
the subcontractor in the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down menu, and entering a price in the `Price`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

Then, click on the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
and use the `Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
configure a route that determines what happens to the finished product
once it has been manufactured by the subcontractor.

If the finished product is shipped back to the contracting company, make
sure the `Buy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} route is selected. In
addition, select the `Replenish on Order (MTO)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} route to automatically create a
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the product
upon confirmation of a sales order (SO), unless there is enough stock
on-hand to fulfill the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

If the finished product is shipped directly to the customer by the
subcontractor, make sure that **only** the `Dropship`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} route is selected.

### Configure BoM

To configure a `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
for basic subcontracting, click the
`Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button on
the product form, and select the desired
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Alternatively, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Products --> Bills of Materials`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the
subcontracted product.

::: seealso
For a full overview of `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} configuration, see the `Bill of materials
<../basic_setup/bill_configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation.
:::

In the `BoM Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select the
`Subcontracting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. Then, add
one or more subcontractors in the `Subcontractors`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field that appears below.

![The \"BoM Type\" field on a BoM, configured to manufacture the product using subcontracting.](subcontracting_basic/bom-type.png){.align-center}

Finally, click on the `Miscellaneous`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab. In the `Manuf. Lead Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
enter the number of days it takes the subcontractor to manufacture the
product. This number is factored in when calculating the product\'s
expected arrival date.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When using basic subcontracting, there is no need to list components in
the `Components`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, since the
components required for manufacturing, and the means by which they are
acquired, are handled by the subcontractor.
::::

## Basic subcontracting workflow

The basic subcontracting workflow consists of up to four steps:

1.  Create a sales order (SO) for the subcontracted product; doing so
    creates a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
    purchase the product from the subcontractor.
2.  Confirm the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
    created in the previous step, or create a new
    `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}; doing so
    creates a receipt order or a dropship order.
3.  Process the receipt once the subcontractor has finished
    manufacturing the subcontracted product, and shipped it back to the
    contracting company, **OR** process the dropship order to ship the
    product directly to the customer.
4.  If the workflow was started by creating an
    `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and the finished
    product is not dropshipped to the end customer, process the delivery
    order once the product is shipped to the customer.

The specific number of steps depends on the reason that the
subcontracted product is being purchased from the subcontractor.

If the reason is to fulfill a specific customer order, the process
starts with creating an `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, and ends with delivering the product to the customer, or
having the subcontractor dropship it to them.

If the reason is to increase the quantity of stock on-hand, the process
starts with creating a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, and ends with receiving the product into inventory.

### Create SO

It is only necessary to complete this step if the product is being
purchased from the subcontractor to fulfill a customer need. If the
product is being purchased to increase the quantity of stock on-hand,
move on to the next step.

To create a new `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
navigate to `Sales app --> Orders --> Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Select the customer in the `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down menu. Then, click `Add a
product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
`Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, select a
subcontracted product in the `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu, and enter a quantity in the
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, at which point a
`Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button appears at
the top of the page. This opens the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} created to purchase
the subcontracted product from the subcontractor.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

An `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the product
only creates a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} if
the *Replenish on Order (MTO)* route is enabled on the product\'s form,
**and** there is not enough stock of the product on-hand to fulfill the
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

If there is enough stock on-hand, confirming an
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the product
creates a delivery order instead, because Odoo assumes that the
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is fulfilled using the
stock in the warehouse.

This is not the case for subcontracted products that are dropshipped to
the end customer. In that case, a
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is **always**
created, even if there is enough stock on-hand.
::::

### Process PO

If a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} was created in
the previous step, navigate to it by clicking the
`Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the top of
the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, or by going to
`Purchase app --> Orders --> Purchase
Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and selecting the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Then, click
`Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm it, and
move on to the next step.

If a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} was not
created in the previous step, do so now by navigating to `Purchase
app --> Orders --> Purchase Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and clicking `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Begin filling out the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} by selecting a subcontractor from the
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu. In the
`Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a new
product line. Select a subcontracted product in the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and enter the
quantity in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
Finally, click `Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
confirm the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

When a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is confirmed
for a product manufactured using basic subcontracting, a receipt or
dropship order is automatically created, and can be accessed from the
corresponding `Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Dropship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button that appears
at the top of the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

<figure class="align-center">

alt="A PO for a basic subcontracting product, with a Receipt smart button at the top of the page." />
<figcaption>PO for a basic subcontracting product, with a Receipt smart
button at the top of the page.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Process receipt or dropship order

Once the subcontractor has finished manufacturing the product, they
either ship it to the contracting company, or dropship it to the end
customer, depending on how the product was
`configured <manufacturing/workflows/subcontracting_basic/product-config>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

#### Process receipt

If the subcontractor ships the finished product to the contracting
company, once it has been received, navigate to
`Purchase app --> Orders --> Purchase Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Click the `Receive Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
at the top of the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
or the `Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the
top of the page, to open the receipt. Then, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the receipt
to enter the product into inventory.

#### Process dropship order

If the subcontractor dropships the product, once they have sent it,
navigate to
`Purchase app --> Orders --> Purchase Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Select the `Dropship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at
the top of the page to open the dropship order, and click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the order to
confirm that the product has been sent to the customer.

### Process delivery order

If the subcontracting workflow was started by a customer
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and the finished
product was **not** dropshipped to the customer, but rather delivered to
the contracting company, it is necessary to ship the product to the
customer, and process the delivery order.

Once the product has been shipped to the customer, navigate to the
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, and select the
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Select the
`Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the top of
the page to open the delivery order, and click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the order to confirm
that the product has been shipped.

# Dropship to subcontractor

In manufacturing, subcontracting is the process of a company engaging a
third-party manufacturer, or subcontractor, to manufacture products that
are then sold by the contracting company.

In Odoo, the *Dropship Subcontractor on Order* route is used to purchase
the necessary components for a subcontracted product from the vendor,
and have them delivered directly to the subcontractor, each time a
purchase order (PO) for that product is confirmed.

The subcontractor then uses the components to manufacture the desired
product, before shipping it back to the contracting company.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

It is necessary to understand the differences between the *Dropship* and
*Dropship Subcontractor on Order* routes. While both routes involve
dropshipping, they are used for different purposes.

The *Dropship* route is used to purchase products from a vendor, and
have them shipped directly to the end customer.

The *Dropship Subcontractor on Order* route is used to purchase
components from a vendor, and have them shipped directly to a
subcontractor. By default, finished products are then sent from the
subcontractor back to the contracting company.

However, it is possible to combine both the *Dropship* and *Dropship
Subcontractor on Order* routes so they are used for the same product. In
this workflow, components are dropshipped to the subcontractor, who then
ships the finished product directly to the end customer.

This can be achieved by following steps one through five in the
`workflow section
<manufacturing/workflows/subcontracting-dropship>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} of this doc.
::::

## Configuration

To use the *Dropship Subcontractor on Order* route, navigate to
`Manufacturing app
--> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and enable the checkbox next to `Subcontracting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, under the `Operations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} heading.

Once the *Subcontracting* setting is enabled, it is also necessary to
properly configure the subcontracted product, the product\'s
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and the
components listed on the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

### Configure product

To configure a product for the *Dropship Subcontractor on Order* route,
navigate to `Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a product, or create a new one by
clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Select the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and add
the product\'s subcontractor as a vendor by clicking
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, selecting the
subcontractor in the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down menu, and entering a price in the `Price`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

Then, click on the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to
configure a route that determines what happens to the finished product,
once it has been manufactured by the subcontractor.

If the finished product is shipped back to the contracting company, make
sure that the `Buy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} route is
selected. In addition, select the
`Replenish on Order (MTO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} route to
automatically create a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} for the product upon confirmation of a
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, unless there is
enough stock on-hand to fulfill the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

If the finished product is shipped directly to the customer by the
subcontractor, make sure that only the `Dropship`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} route is selected.

### Configure bill of materials

To configure a `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
for the *Dropship Subcontractor on Order* route, click the `Bill of
Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button on the
product\'s page, and select the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Alternatively, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Products --> Bills of Materials`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the
subcontracted product.

::: seealso
For a full overview of `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} configuration, see the `Bill of materials
<../basic_setup/bill_configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation.
:::

In the `BoM Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select the
`Subcontracting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. Then, add
one or more subcontractors in the `Subcontractors`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field that appears below.

![The \"BoM Type\" field on a BoM, configured to manufacture the product using subcontracting.](subcontracting_dropship/bom-type.png){.align-center}

Finally, make sure that all necessary components are specified on the
`Components`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. To add a new
component, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select
the component in the `Component`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down menu, and specify the required quantity in the
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

### Configure Components

To configure components for the *Dropship Subcontractor on Order* route,
navigate to each component from the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by selecting
the component\'s name in the `Components`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and clicking the
`➡️ (right arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to the
right of the name.

Alternatively, navigate to each component by going to
`Inventory app --> Products -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and selecting the
component.

On the component product form, select the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and add a vendor by clicking
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, selecting the vendor in
the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and adding the
price they sell the product for in the `Price`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. This is the vendor that sends components to the
subcontractor, once they are purchased.

Then, click on the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
and select the `Dropship Subcontractor on
Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} route in the
`Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

Repeat the process for every component that must be dropshipped to the
subcontractor.

## Dropship subcontractor on order workflow {#manufacturing/workflows/subcontracting-dropship}

The dropship subcontractor on order workflow consists of up to six
steps:

1.  Create a sales order (SO) for the subcontracted product; doing so
    creates a *subcontractor* `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} to purchase the product from the subcontractor.
2.  Confirm the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
    created in the previous step, or create a new
    `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}; doing so
    creates a request for quotation (RfQ) to purchase the components
    from the vendor, as well as a receipt order or a dropship order.
3.  Confirm the `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} to turn it into a second
    `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} (*vendor*
    `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}); doing so
    creates a *Dropship Subcontractor* order.
4.  Process the *Dropship Subcontractor* order once the vendor has sent
    the components to the subcontractor.
5.  Process the receipt once the subcontractor has finished
    manufacturing the subcontracted product, and shipped it back to the
    contracting company **OR** process the dropship order to ship the
    product directly to the end customer.
6.  If the workflow was started by creating an
    `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and the finished
    product is not dropshipped to the end customer, process the delivery
    order once the product has been shipped to the customer.

The specific number of steps depends on the reason that the
subcontracted product is being purchased from the subcontractor.

If the reason is to fulfill a specific customer order, the process
starts with creating an SO, and ends with delivering the product to the
customer, or having the subcontractor dropship it to them.

If the reason is to increase quantity of stock on-hand, the process
starts with creating a PO, and ends with receiving the product into
inventory.

### Create an SO

It is only necessary to complete this step if the product is being
purchased from the subcontractor to fulfill a customer need. If the
product is being purchased to increase the quantity of stock on-hand,
move on to the next step.

To create a new `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
navigate to `Sales app --> Orders --> Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Select the customer in the `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down menu. Then, click `Add a
product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
`Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, select the product
in the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu, and
enter a quantity in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

Click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, at which point a
`Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button appears at
the top of the page. This is the *subcontractor*
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, or the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} created to purchase
the subcontracted product from the subcontractor.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

An `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the product
only creates a *subcontractor* `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} if the *Replenish on Order (MTO)* route is enabled on the
product\'s page, **and** there is no stock of the product on-hand.

If there is stock on-hand, confirming an
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the product will
instead create a delivery order, because Odoo assumes that the
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is fulfilled using the
stock in the warehouse.

This is not the case for subcontracted products that are dropshipped to
the end customer. In that case, a *subcontractor*
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is **always**
created, even if there is stock on-hand.
::::

### Process subcontractor PO

If a *subcontractor* `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} was not created in the previous step, do so now by
navigating to
`Purchase app --> Orders --> Purchase Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and clicking `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Begin filling out the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} by selecting a subcontractor from the
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu.

In the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a new
product line. Select a product produced by the subcontractor in the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and enter the
quantity in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Finally, click `Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
confirm the *subcontractor* `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

When a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is confirmed
for a product that requires dropshipping components to a subcontractor,
a receipt or dropship order is automatically created, and can be
accessed from the corresponding `Receipt`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Dropship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button that appears at the top of the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

![A subcontractor PO for a \*Dropship Subcontractor on Order\* product, with a Receipt smart
button at the top of the page.](subcontracting_dropship/subcontractor-po.png){.align-center}

In addition, an `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is created for the components that are purchased from the
vendor and sent to the subcontractor. However, the
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} **IS NOT**
automatically linked to the *subcontractor*
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Once the `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
confirmed and becomes a *vendor* `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, a *Dropship Subcontractor* order is created. This order is
linked to both the *vendor* `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and the *subcontractor*
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

### Confirm vendor RfQ

To access the `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} created by confirming the *subcontractor*
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, navigate to
`Purchase app --> Orders --> Requests for Quotation`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select the
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that lists
the correct vendor in the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, and the reference number of the receipt that was created after
confirming *subcontractor* `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, in the `Source Document`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

On the `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
`Deliver To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field reads
`Dropship Subcontractor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Dropship Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field shows the
name of the subcontractor to whom components are being dropshipped.

Click `Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to turn the
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} into a
*vendor* `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and
confirm the purchase of components from the vendor. After doing so, a
`Dropship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button appears at
the top of the *vendor* `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, and a `Resupply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button appears at the top of the *subcontractor*
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

![A vendor PO for the components of a \*Dropship Subcontractor on Order\* product, with a
Dropship smart button at the top of the page.](subcontracting_dropship/vendor-po.png){.align-center}

### Process Dropship Subcontractor order

Once the components have been delivered to the subcontractor, navigate
to `Purchase
app --> Orders --> Purchase Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the *vendor*
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or the
*subcontractor* `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
Then, click the `Dropship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button or the `Resupply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button, respectively.

Clicking either button opens the *Dropship Subcontractor* order. Click
the `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top of
the order to confirm that the subcontractor has received the components.

### Process receipt or dropship order

Once the subcontractor has manufactured the finished product, navigate
to `Purchase
app --> Orders --> Purchase Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the *subcontractor*
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

If the subcontracted product should be received into inventory, once the
product arrives, click the `Receive Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button at the top of the *subcontractor*
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to open the
receipt. Then, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at
the top of the receipt to register the product into inventory.

Alternatively, select the `Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
smart button at the top of the *subcontractor*
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the receipt.

If the subcontracted product should be dropshipped, select the
`Dropship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top of the
page to open the dropship order, and click `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} once the subcontractor has sent the product to the
customer.

### Process delivery order

If the subcontracting workflow was started by a customer
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and the finished
product was **not** dropshipped to the customer, but rather delivered to
the contracting company, it is necessary to ship the product to the
customer, and process the delivery order.

Once the product has been shipped to the customer, navigate to the
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, and select the
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Select the
`Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the top of
the page to open the delivery order, and click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm that the
product has been shipped to the customer.

# Resupply subcontractor

In manufacturing, subcontracting is the process of a company engaging a
third-party manufacturer, or subcontractor, to manufacture products that
are then sold by the contracting company.

In Odoo, the *Resupply Subcontractor on Order* route is used to deliver
the necessary components for a subcontracted product to the
subcontractor, each time a purchase order (PO) for that product is
confirmed.

The subcontractor then uses the components to manufacture the desired
product, before shipping it back to the contracting company, or
dropshipping it to the end customer.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

It is necessary to understand the differences between the *Resupply
Subcontractor on Order* and the *Dropship Subcontractor on Order*
routes.

While both routes are used to supply a subcontractor with the components
required for manufacturing a product, they differ in how the components
are sourced.

When using *Resupply Subcontractor on Order*, components are shipped
from the warehouse of the contracting company.

When using *Dropship Subcontractor on Order*, components are purchased
from a vendor and shipped directly to the subcontractor.

The choice of which route to use depends upon the specific requirements
of the subcontracting company and their subcontractors.

See the `subcontracting_dropship`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation for a full overview of the *Dropship Subcontractor on
Order* route.
::::

## Configuration

To use the *Resupply Subcontractor on Order* route, navigate to
`Manufacturing app
--> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and enable the checkbox next to `Subcontracting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, under the `Operations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} heading.

Once the *Subcontracting* setting is enabled, it is also necessary to
properly configure the subcontracted product, the product\'s bill of
materials (BoM), and the components listed on the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

### Configure product {#manufacturing/workflows/subcontracting_resupply/product-config}

To configure a product for the *Resupply Subcontractor on Order* route,
navigate to `Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a product, or create a new one by
clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Select the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and add
the product\'s subcontractor as a vendor by clicking
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, selecting the
subcontractor in the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down menu, and entering a price in the `Price`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The value entered in the `Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field on the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the of
the subcontracted product\'s page is the amount paid to the
subcontractor for the manufacturing of the product.

This does not represent the total cost of the product, which includes
other elements, like the cost of the product\'s components.
::::

Then, click on the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to
configure a route that determines what happens to the finished product,
once it has been manufactured by the subcontractor.

If the finished product is shipped back to the contracting company, make
sure that the `Buy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} route is
selected. In addition, select the
`Replenish on Order (MTO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} route to
automatically create a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} for the product upon confirmation of a sales order (SO),
unless there is enough stock on-hand to fulfill the
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

If the finished product is shipped directly to the customer by the
subcontractor, make sure that only the `Dropship`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} route is selected.

### Configure BoM

To configure a `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
for the *Resupply Subcontractor on Order* route, click the `Bill of
Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button on the
product\'s page, and select the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Alternatively, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Products --> Bills of Materials`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the
subcontracted product.

::: seealso
For a full overview of `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} configuration, see the `Bill of materials
<../basic_setup/bill_configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation.
:::

In the `BoM Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select the
`Subcontracting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. Then, add
one or more subcontractors in the `Subcontractors`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field that appears below.

![The \"BoM Type\" field on a BoM, configured to manufacture the product using subcontracting.](subcontracting_resupply/bom-type.png){.align-center}

Finally, make sure that all necessary components are specified on the
`Components`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. To add a new
component, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select
the component in the `Component`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down menu, and specify the required quantity in the
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

### Configure components

To configure components for the *Resupply Subcontractor on Order* route,
navigate to each component from the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by selecting
the component\'s name in the `Components`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and clicking the
`➡️ (right arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to the
right of the name.

Alternatively, navigate to each component by going to
`Inventory app --> Products -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and selecting the
component.

On the component product form, click on the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and select the
`Resupply Subcontractor on Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
route in the `Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

Repeat the process for every component that must be sent to the
subcontractor.

## Resupply subcontractor on order workflow

The resupply subcontractor on order workflow consists of up to five
steps:

1.  Create an `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the
    subcontracted product; doing so creates a
    `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to purchase the
    product from the subcontractor.
2.  Confirm the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
    created in the previous step, or create a new
    `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}; doing so
    creates a *Resupply Subcontractor* order, as well as a receipt order
    or a dropship order.
3.  Process the *Resupply Subcontractor* order once components for the
    subcontracted product have been sent to the subcontractor.
4.  Process the receipt once the subcontractor has finished
    manufacturing the subcontracted product, and shipped it back to the
    contracting company **OR** process the dropship order to ship the
    product directly to the customer.
5.  If the workflow was started by creating an
    `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and the finished
    product is not dropshipped to the end customer, process the delivery
    order once the product is shipped to the customer.

The specific number of steps depends on the reason that the
subcontracted product is being purchased from the subcontractor.

If the reason is to fulfill a specific customer order, the process
starts with creating an `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, and ends with delivering the product to the customer, or
having the subcontractor dropship it to them.

If the reason is to increase the quantity of stock on-hand, the process
starts with creating a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, and ends with receiving the product into inventory.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

While the *Resupply Subcontractor on Order* route can be used to
automatically resupply a subcontractor upon confirmation of a
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, it is also
possible to create a resupply order manually. This workflow is useful
when it is necessary to resupply the subcontractor without creating a
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

To resupply a subcontractor manually, navigate to the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, and click on
the `Resupply Subcontractor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} card.
Create a new *Resupply Subcontractor* order by clicking
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In the `Delivery Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
select the subcontractor to whom the components should be sent.

Then, add each component to the `Operations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab by clicking `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, selecting the component in the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field, and
specifying a quantity in the `Demand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

Finally, click `Mark as Todo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
register the order. Once the components have been sent to the
subcontractor, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
confirm that the order has been sent.
::::

### Create SO

It is only necessary to complete this step if the product is being
purchased from the subcontractor to fulfill a customer need. If the
product is being purchased to increase the quantity of stock on-hand,
move on to the next step.

To create a new `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
navigate to `Sales app --> Orders --> Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Select the customer in the `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down menu. Then, click `Add a
product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
`Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, select a
subcontracted product in the `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu, and enter a quantity in the
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, at which point a
`Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button appears at
the top of the page. This opens the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} created to purchase
the subcontracted product from the subcontractor.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

An `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the product
only creates a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} if
the *Replenish on Order (MTO)* route is enabled on the product\'s page,
**and** there is not enough stock of the product on-hand to fulfill the
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

If there is enough stock on-hand, confirming an
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the product
instead creates a delivery order, because Odoo assumes that the
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is fulfilled using the
stock in the warehouse.

This is not the case for subcontracted products that are dropshipped to
the end customer. In that case, a
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is **always**
created, even if there is enough stock on-hand.
::::

### Process PO

If a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} was created in
the previous step, navigate to `Purchase app --> Orders -->
Purchase Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Then, click
`Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm it.

If a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} was not
created in the previous step, do so now by navigating to `Purchase
app --> Orders --> Purchase Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and clicking `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Begin filling out the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} by selecting a subcontractor from the
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu. In the
`Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a new
product line. Select a subcontracted product in the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and enter the
quantity in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
Finally, click `Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
confirm the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

When a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is confirmed
for a product that requires resupplying a subcontractor with components,
a receipt or dropship order is automatically created, and can be
accessed from the corresponding `Receipt`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Dropship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button that appears at the top of the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

In addition, a *Resupply Subcontractor* order is created to ship the
required components to the subcontractor. This order can also be
accessed from the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
by clicking the `Resupply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button at the top of the page.

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="subcontracting_resupply/subcontractor-po.png"
alt="A PO for a *Resupply Subcontractor on Order* product, with Resupply and Receipt smart buttons at the top of the page. A PO for a *Resupply Subcontractor on Order* product, with Resupply and Receipt smart buttons at the top of the page." />
</figure>

### Process Resupply Subcontractor order

Once the subcontracted product\'s components have been sent to the
subcontractor, navigate to
`Purchase app --> Orders --> Purchase Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Click the `Resupply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at
the top of the screen to open the *Resupply Subcontractor* order, and
click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm that the
components have been sent to the subcontractor.

Alternatively, navigate to the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} app, click the `# To Process`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the
`Resupply Subcontractor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} card, and
select the *Resupply Subcontractor* order. Then, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm that the
components have been sent to the subcontractor.

### Process receipt or dropship order

Once the subcontractor has finished manufacturing the product, they
either ship it to the contracting company, or dropship it to the end
customer, depending on how the product was
`configured <manufacturing/workflows/subcontracting_resupply/product-config>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

#### Process receipt

If the subcontractor ships the finished product to the contracting
company, once it has been received, navigate to
`Purchase app --> Orders --> Purchase Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Click the `Receive Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
at the top of the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
or the `Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the
top of the page, to open the receipt. Then, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the receipt
to enter the product into inventory.

#### Process dropship order

If the subcontractor dropships the product, once they have sent it,
navigate to
`Purchase app --> Orders --> Purchase Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Select the `Dropship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at
the top of the page to open the dropship order, and click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the order to
confirm that the product has been sent to the customer.

### Process delivery order

If the subcontracting workflow was started by a customer
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and the finished
product was **NOT** dropshipped to the customer, but rather delivered to
the contracting company, it is necessary to ship the product to the
customer, and process the delivery order.

Once the product has been shipped to the customer, navigate to the
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, and select the
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Select the
`Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the top of
the page to open the delivery order, and click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the order to confirm
that the product has been shipped to the customer.

# Subcontracting

In manufacturing, *subcontracting* is the process of a company engaging
a third-party manufacturer, or subcontractor, to manufacture products
that are then sold by the contracting company.

Subcontracting provides a variety of benefits for both the contracting
company and the subcontractor.

For the contracting company, subcontracting allows them to sell a wide
variety of manufactured products, without having to worry about
investing in and maintaining the equipment and labor required to handle
the manufacturing themselves.

This helps contracting companies stay flexible throughout economic
cycles, as they can easily increase or decrease their engagements with
subcontractors, as necessitated by the current moment. It also means
they are able to focus on tasks they excel at, while delegating more
specialized work to subcontractors.

On the other side of the relationship, subcontracting allows
subcontractors to specialize in more niche areas of production, which
might not be as profitable outside the bounds of a subcontracting
engagement. In certain arrangements, it also provides them with the
flexibility to choose which projects they accept or decline, and how
many they work on at any given time.

In Odoo, companies can configure their subcontracting workflows based on
a variety of different factors, including how components are sourced,
and what happens to finished products once they are manufactured.

:::
::::::

## Configuration

To enable subcontracting in Odoo, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Configuration
--> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and tick the
checkbox next to the `Subcontracting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
setting, under the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
heading. Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Subcontracting setting in the manufacturing app.](subcontracting/subcontracting-setting.png){.align-center}

With subcontracting enabled, a few different features become available
in Odoo:

- On bills of materials (BoMs), the *BoM Type* field now includes a
  *Subcontracting* option. Enabling the *Subcontracting*
  `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} type
  designates the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"}\'s product as a subcontracted product, which means Odoo
  knows that it is produced by a subcontractor, and not by the company
  that owns the Odoo database.
- Two subcontracting routes become available in the *Inventory* app, and
  can be assigned to specific products, on the *Inventory* tab of their
  product pages:
  - *Resupply Subcontractor on Order*
  - *Dropship Subcontractor on Order*

## Subcontracting workflows

In Odoo, there are three subcontracting workflows, the main difference
between them being *how* the subcontractor obtains the necessary
components:

- In the *basic* subcontracting workflow, the subcontractor is fully
  responsible for obtaining the components. This workflow is outlined in
  the `subcontracting/subcontracting_basic`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} documentation.
- In the *Resupply Subcontractor on Order* workflow, the contracting
  company sends the components from their warehouse to the
  subcontractor. This workflow is outlined in the
  `subcontracting/subcontracting_resupply`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
  documentation.
- In the *Dropship Subcontractor on Order* workflow, the contracting
  company purchases the components from a vendor, and has them delivered
  directly to the subcontractor. This workflow is outlined in the
  `subcontracting/subcontracting_dropship`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
  documentation.

In addition to how a subcontractor obtains components, it is also
necessary to consider why a product is being subcontracted, as well as
what happens to products once they are manufactured by the
subcontractor.

In terms of why a product is being subcontracted, the two main reasons
are to fulfill a customer order, or to replenish the quantity of stock
on-hand.

In terms of what happens to products once they are manufactured, they
can either be shipped to the contracting company, or dropshipped
directly to an end customer.

Each of the three subcontracting workflows described above can be
configured to facilitate any of these possibilities, and the methods for
doing so are outlined in their respective documentation.

## Subcontracted product valuation

The valuation of a subcontracted product depends upon a few different
variables:

- The cost of the required components, if provided by the contracting
  company; from here on referred to as [C]{.title-ref}.
- The price paid to the subcontractor for the service of manufacturing
  the subcontracted product; from here on referred to as
  [M]{.title-ref}.
- The cost of shipping components to the subcontractor, and having them
  shipped back to the contracting company; from here on referred to as
  [S]{.title-ref}.
- The cost of dropshipping, if the components are shipped by the
  subcontractor to the end customer; from here on referred to as
  [D]{.title-ref}.
- Any other associated costs, like import taxes, etc.; from here on
  referred to as [x]{.title-ref}.

Therefore, the total valuation of a subcontracted product
([P]{.title-ref}) can be represented by the following equation:

$$P = C + M + S + D + x$$

It is important to note that not every subcontracted product valuation
will include all of these variables. For example, if the product is not
dropshipped to the end customer, then there is no need to factor in the
cost of dropshipping.

# By-Products

When manufacturing certain products, it is common to be left with
residual materials, in addition to the finished product. These materials
are known as *by-products*. By specifying the by-products created during
manufacturing on a product\'s bill of materials (BoM), the quantity of
by-products on-hand is tracked by Odoo.

::: example
Manufacturing a *rocking chair* requires ten pieces of wood. During
production, five pieces of *scrap wood* are created, in addition to the
rocking chair. By designating the scrap wood as a by-product on the
rocking chair\'s `BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, Odoo tracks the on-hand count of scrap wood, as well as
the quantity of rocking chairs produced.
:::

## Configuration

To specify by-products on a product\'s
`BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
*By-Products* setting **must** be enabled. To do so, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and tick the `By-Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox, located under the
`Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading. Then, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to apply the change.

![The By-Products setting on the Manufacturing app settings page.](byproducts/byproducts-setting.png){.align-center}

With the `By-Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting
enabled, a `By-products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab appears
on product `BoMs (bills of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

## Add byproduct to BoM

To add by-products to a `BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, navigate to `Manufacturing app --> Products --> Bills
of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select a
`BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

On the `BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, select
the `By-products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select the
by-product in the `By-product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down field. In the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, enter the quantity of the by-product produced during
manufacturing.

If the by-product is produced during a specific operation of a
manufacturing order (MO), select the operation in the
`Produced in Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. For
example, if a scrap wood by-product is produced during an *Assemble*
operation, select that operation in the `Produced in
Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![The By-Products tab on a BoM, configured with a \"Scrap Wood\" by-product.](byproducts/byproducts-tab.png){.align-center}

## Manufacture by-product

When an `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
completed and marked as *Done*, Odoo registers the quantity of
by-products created during the manufacturing process. To create a new
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, navigate to
`Manufacturing
app --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

In the `Bill of Material`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
select a `BoM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} on
which by-products have been specified. After doing so, the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field auto-populates with
the corresponding product. Click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to confirm the
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

When manufacturing is completed, click the
`Produce All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top of
the `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. After
doing so, inventory counts update to reflect the quantity of
by-product(s) produced, as well as the quantity of the product.

Click the `Product Moves`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button at the top of the `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} page to see the movements of components and products. Each
by-product is listed on the resulting
`Inventory Moves`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, with the
`From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column displaying the virtual
production location, and the `To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column displaying the location where the by-product is stored.

# Continuous product improvement

*Continuous improvement* is a general philosophy intended to help
individuals and organizations constantly improve themselves and the work
they produce.

There are a variety of different methodologies that fall under the
umbrella of continuous improvement. These include kaizen, six sigma, and
lean, among others. While the specific steps of each method differ,
their goal remains the same: implement a process by which improvement is
a perpetual goal, rather than a one-time accomplishment.

The sections below contain details about how Odoo can be used to
implement four general steps common to many of the most popular
continuous improvement strategies, with links to documentation about
configuring the necessary features. The final section details how a
specific company might configure these Odoo implementations within their
organization.

1.  `manufacturing/workflows/ci-identify`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
2.  `manufacturing/workflows/ci-suggest`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
3.  `manufacturing/workflows/ci-implement`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
4.  `manufacturing/workflows/ci-review`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Continuous improvement is not a one-size-fits-all methodology. While
most strategies include between four and six steps, proper
implementation requires developing a system tailored to the specific
needs of each company.

This is not a limitation, but rather a benefit, as it makes the
methodology flexible enough to adapt to almost any use case. Odoo, in
particular, adapts well to this flexibility, as it can be configured to
meet the needs of almost any workflow.

As such, it is important to remember the content below only provides
*examples* of how Odoo *might* be used. They should be viewed as more of
a starting point, rather than a concrete outline that every organization
must follow.
::::

## Identify problems {#manufacturing/workflows/ci-identify}

Before improvement can begin, it is necessary to determine where
improvement is necessary. This is where identifying problems comes into
play. Two of the best Odoo apps for identifying problems with products
or processes are *Helpdesk* and *Quality*.

### Helpdesk

The *Helpdesk* app is useful for receiving feedback from outside of the
organization, like from clients or customers. This is accomplished by
implementing one (or more) of the methods for
`receiving tickets <../../../services/helpdesk/overview/receiving_tickets>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, including email aliases, live chat conversations, and
website forms.

Using these methods, customers can submit feedback about problems, which
is then reviewed by a member of a
`helpdesk team <../../../services/helpdesk>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. Depending on the outcome of the review, the team member may
decide to take further action to ensure the issue is addressed. This can
include creating a
`quality alert <../../quality/quality_management/quality_alerts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

### Quality

The *Quality* app is useful for receiving feedback from *within* the
organization, like from employees.

One method for accomplishing this is to set up a `quality control point
<../../quality/quality_management/quality_control_points>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} (QCP). A `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is used to automatically create quality checks at regular
intervals, prompting employees to inspect, and confirm, the quality of a
product.

If an issue is found, an employee can then create a `quality alert
<../../quality/quality_management/quality_alerts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to notify a quality team. Quality alerts can also be created
independent of a `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, in the event that an employee discovers an issue without
being prompted to check for one. This is a great way for customer
support employees to notify a quality team of an issue brought to their
attention by a customer ticket.

## Suggest improvements {#manufacturing/workflows/ci-suggest}

Once a problem is identified, the next step is to put forward ideas for
how to address the problem. As with identifying problems, the *Quality
app* is also useful for suggesting improvements. In addition, the *PLM*
(*Product Lifecycle Management*) app can be used for this purpose, as
well.

### Quality

When creating a
`quality alert <../../quality/quality_management/quality_alerts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to bring an issue to the attention of a quality team, the
`Corrective Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Preventive Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tabs can be used
to provide feedback about how the issue can be addressed.

The `Corrective Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab is used
to suggest a method for fixing items affected by the issue. For example,
[Screw the bolts on tighter, so the seat stays in place]{.title-ref}.

The `Preventive Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab is used
to suggest a method for preventing the issue from occurring in the
future. For example, [Do not tighten the screws too much, or they will
be stripped]{.title-ref}.

The quality team that reviews the alert sees these suggested actions,
and can take them into account when deciding how to address the issue.

### PLM

The `PLM (Product Lifecycle Management)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
app is used to manage the lifecycle of a product from its introduction
through each successive version. As such, it is useful for testing ideas
for product improvements.

Using
`engineering change orders <../../plm/manage_changes/engineering_change_orders>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, product management teams can create new iterations of
product `BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
adding or removing specific components or operations, as needed. The
products created using these
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are put
through a review process to confirm the effectiveness of the changes.

## Implement strategies {#manufacturing/workflows/ci-implement}

Implementing strategies involves putting the proposed solutions from the
suggest improvements step into action. The
`PLM (Product Lifecycle Management)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} app
continues to be useful during this step, as it can be configured to make
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} updates. The
*Field Service* app can also be used by certain companies to make
improvements to products that have already been sold to customers.

### PLM

Once `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} changes
have gone through the proper review process, they can be approved, and
the updated `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} put
into use. This is accomplished by configuring one of the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} review
stages to `apply the changes <plm/eco/apply-changes>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} made to the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, at which point the updated
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} becomes
available for new `MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

Product `BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can
continue to be updated, as needed. The `version control
<../../plm/manage_changes/version_control>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} features of the
`PLM (Product Lifecycle Management)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} app
allow for easy management of all versions of a given
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

### Field Service

The `PLM (Product Lifecycle Management)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
app is a great way to make changes to product
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. However,
these changes only affect products produced using the new
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. If a defective
product has already been sold to a customer, it may be necessary to
repair (or update) that product.

In such a case, the *Field Service* app can be used to schedule
`onsite interventions
<../../../services/field_service/creating_tasks>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. These interventions allow service technicians (or other
employees) to be sent to a customer\'s location to address an issue with
a product.

## Review actions {#manufacturing/workflows/ci-review}

Reviewing actions is where the \"continuous\" part of continuous
improvement comes into play, as it allows an organization to evaluate
the decisions made in the previous steps. As such, this step is,
essentially, returning to the beginning of the process, so that
additional problems can be identified and addressed.

This means that the *Helpdesk* and *Quality* apps should be used again
to receive customer and employee feedback. Another app that may be
useful at this stage is the *Surveys* app.

### Surveys

After implementing changes to a product or process, it may be wise to
solicit customers for their feedback directly, rather than waiting to
hear from them of their own volition. This may bring to light feedback
that customers may have otherwise neglected to share.

One of the best ways to accomplish this is through the
`Surveys <../../../marketing/surveys>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
app. Creating a survey, and sending it to customers who receive an
updated product, increases the likelihood of receiving relevant feedback
about the product.

::: {.admonition .alert .alert-success}
Example workflow: coat rack product improvement

*Wood Hut* is a manufacturer of fine wood products. They are committed
to manufacturing products of the highest-possible quality, and are
always looking for ways to improve the products they sell, along with
the processes used to create them.

Wood Hut uses the Odoo platform to manage every element of their
production, fulfillment, and customer satisfaction processes. They have
developed a custom product improvement workflow that incorporates the
Helpdesk, Quality, PLM, and Manufacturing apps.

One of Wood Hut\'s most popular products is their *coat rack*. It\'s
made entirely of oak, and customers describe it as \"sleek and
elegant.\" However, recent customer feedback about the coat rack has
brought attention to quality issues that necessitate revising the
current manufacturing process.

The product revision workflow begins when the customer service team
receives a ticket in the Helpdesk app from a customer having problems
with the coat rack she purchased. The customer, Abigail Peterson, has
found that her coat rack falls over when more than five coats are
hanging from it. This is a major issue, as the coat rack has enough
dowels for six coats.

![A Helpdesk ticket about an issue with the coat rack product.](continuous_improvement/helpdesk-ticket.png){.align-center}

Marc, the customer service employee assigned to the helpdesk ticket,
opens the Quality app, and creates a new quality alert. He tags the
*Production Quality Team* and assigns Julie Andreson as the quality
employee responsible for the alert.

Julie reviews the alert, and consults with her team about the best
course of action. They decide that it is necessary to revise the
product\'s `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
prevent the issue from occurring in the future, which Julie notes in the
`Corrective Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
quality alert.

![A quality alert created about the issue with the coat rack product.](continuous_improvement/quality-alert.png){.align-center}

Then, Julie messages product engineer, Joe Kazan in the chatter of the
quality alert to bring it to his attention. Joe opens the
`PLM (Product Lifecycle Management)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} app
and creates a new `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, noting the problem with the coat rack, and suggesting that
a change to the product\'s `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} may be necessary.

![An ECO created to update the coat rack product\'s BoM.](continuous_improvement/eco.png){.align-center}

Joe clicks `Start Revision`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and then
the `Revision`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button to open
version two of the coat rack\'s
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. This
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} was created
alongside the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, and remains archived until it is approved.

After some testing, Joe discovers that adding a metal *support rod* to
the coat rack strengthens it, allowing the rack to hold six or more
coats without falling over. He updates the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to include the
support rod as one of the components, and adds an extra operation to
make sure it is installed during the manufacturing process. Finally, he
leaves a message in the chatter of the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, letting
his manager, Jose, know that it is ready for review.

![The coat rack BoM, updated to add an extra component and operation.](continuous_improvement/bom.png){.align-center}

Jose reviews the changes, and confirms they are an effective method for
addressing the problem with the coat rack. He moves the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to the
*Approved* stage, which makes version two of the coat rack
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} the current
version.

Now, each time an `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is created to produce a coat rack, the updated
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
automatically selected. Wood Hut begins producing the improved coat
rack, and customer feedback confirms that the new version has addressed
the problem with its predecessor.

Using the Odoo platform, Wood Hut has implemented an end-to-end product
improvement process. Since the essential elements of this process
(customer feedback, quality control, etc.) are always functioning, it
can be reused to continuously update products and processes.

# Manufacture with lots and serial numbers

In Odoo, *lot numbers* and *serial numbers* are used to identify and
track products in Odoo. Serial numbers are used to assign unique numbers
to individual products, while lot numbers are used to assign a single
number to multiple units of a specific product.

When manufacturing products tracked using lots or serial numbers, Odoo
requires the lot or serial number to be assigned to each product before
manufacturing can be completed. This ensures that each product is
properly tracked from the moment it enters inventory.

## Configure products for tracking

By default, Odoo tracks the quantity of each product on hand, but does
not track individual units of a product. Lot or serial number tracking
must be enabled for each product individually.

To track a product using lots or serial numbers, begin by navigating to
`Inventory
--> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
then scroll down to the `Traceability`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, and tick the
`Lots & Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.
Finally, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the
change.

Next, click on `Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a product to track. Make sure the
`Track Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox is ticked
in the `General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
Since lot and serial number functionality is enabled, a drop-down menu
appears next to the ticked checkbox.

Click on the `Track Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down menu. By default, `By Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is selected, which only tracks the quantity on hand.
Select `By Lots`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to track the product
using lot numbers, or `By Unique Serial Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to track the product using serial numbers.

## Lot number manufacturing

To manufacture a product tracked with lots, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing -->
Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
create a new manufacturing order (MO).

In the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select a
product tracked using lots, and enter the desired
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Once the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
confirmed, a `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field appears in the top section of the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form. By
default, this field is empty.

To populate the `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field with a lot number, click the `fa-plus-square-o`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(plus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the
right of the field. Doing so automatically generates a lot, using the
next available number, and enters it in the field.

Alternatively, click on the `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field and select an existing lot number, or manually
enter a new lot number and click `Create "#"`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the drop-down menu.

![The \"Lot/Serial Number\" field on an MO.](manufacture_lots_serials/lot-sn-field.png)

Either of these methods assign the product(s) in the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} a lot number
before production is finished. It is also possible to complete
production and close the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} by clicking `Produce All`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, without assigning a lot number. Doing so automatically
generates and assigns a lot, using the next available number.

## Serial number manufacturing

To manufacture a product tracked with serial numbers, begin by
navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
create a new `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

In the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select a
product tracked using serial numbers, and enter the desired
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Once the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
confirmed, a `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field appears in the top section of the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form. By
default, this field is empty.

The rest of the manufacturing process depends on how many units the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} contains.

### Manufacture single unit

If a single unit of the product is being manufactured, clicking
`Produce All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} closes the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and
automatically generates and assigns the next available serial number,
which appears in the `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

To assign a serial number without closing the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, enter a
number manually in the `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, and click `Create "#"`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or click the `fa-plus-square-o`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(plus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the
right of the field to auto-fill it with the next available number.

![The \"Lot/Serial Number\" field on an MO.](manufacture_lots_serials/lot-sn-field.png)

### Manufacture multiple units

::::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When manufacturing a product tracked using serial numbers, an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can be created
for multiple units. However, when serial numbers are assigned to each
unit, either at the end of production or before, the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is split into
multiple `MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
each containing one unit of the product.

Each of the split `MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is identified by a numerical tag added to the end of the
original `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
number.

::: example
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
[WH/MO/00109]{.title-ref} contains two units of a [Chair]{.title-ref}, a
product tracked using serial numbers. A serial number is assigned to
each unit of the chair. This causes the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to be split
into two `MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
each containing one unit of the chair. The
`MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are titled
[WH/MO/00109-001]{.title-ref} and [WH/MO/00109-002]{.title-ref}.
:::
:::::

To assign serial numbers to each unit of an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, click
`Produce All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open the
`Batch Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

The `First Lot/SN`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field of the
pop-up window is auto-filled with the next available serial number. The
`Number of SN`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field defaults to the
number of units being manufactured. The values of either field can be
changed manually.

Click `Generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to generate the
specified number of serial numbers, beginning with the number entered in
the `First Lot/SN`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. The serial
numbers are displayed in the text box at the bottom of the pop-up
window, and can be manually changed after generation.

To assign serial numbers without completing production, click the
`Prepare MO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. Doing so splits
the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} into
individual `MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
one for each unit in the original
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Each
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is left open,
and can be closed individually.

To assign serial numbers and complete production, click the
`Produce`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. Doing so splits the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} into
individual `MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
one for each unit in the original
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. All of the
`MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are closed,
since production is complete.

![The \"Batch Production\" pop-up window, from which serial numbers can be assigned.](manufacture_lots_serials/batch-production.png)

After clicking `Prepare MO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Produce`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Manufacturing`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app
automatically shows the first of the split
`MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} (ex.
[WH/MO/00109-001]{.title-ref}). To view and access the rest the split
`MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, click the
`Backorders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the top
of the screen.

# Manufacturing backorders

In some cases, the full quantity of a manufacturing order cannot be
produced immediately. When this happens, Odoo *Manufacturing* allows for
the manufacturing of partial quantities of the order and creates a
*backorder* for the remaining amount.

In the *Manufacturing* app, creating a backorder splits the original
manufacturing order into two orders. The reference tag for each order is
the tag used for the original order, followed by a hyphen and then an
additional number to indicate that it\'s a backorder.

::: example
A company creates a manufacturing order with the reference tag
*WH/MO/00175*, for 10 units of *Product X*. After starting work on the
manufacturing order, the employee working the production line realizes
there are only enough components in stock to produce five units of the
product.

Instead of waiting for additional stock of the components, they
manufacture five units and create a backorder for the remaining five.
This splits the manufacturing order into two separate orders:
*WH/MO/00175-001* and *WH/MO/00175-002*.

Order *001* contains the five units that have been manufactured, and is
immediately marked as `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Order
*002* contains the five units that still need to be manufactured and is
marked as `In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Once the
remaining components are available, the employee returns to order *002*
and manufactures the remaining units before closing the order.
:::

## Create a manufacturing backorder

To create a backorder for part of a manufacturing order, begin by
navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select a manufacturing order with a quantity of
two or more or create one by clicking `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

If a new manufacturing order is created, select a product from the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu and enter a
quantity of two or more in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, then click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to confirm the order.

After manufacturing the quantity that is being produced immediately,
enter that number in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field at the top of the manufacturing order.

![The quantity field on a manufacturing order.](manufacturing_backorders/quantity-field.png){.align-center}

Next, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a
`You produced less than initial demand`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears, from which a backorder can be
created. Click `Create Backorder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
split the manufacturing order into two separate orders, with the
reference tags *WH/MO/XXXXX-001* and *WH/MO/XXXXX-002*.

![The Create Backorder button on the \"You produced less than initial demand\" pop-up window.](manufacturing_backorders/create-backorder-button.png){.align-center}

Order *001* contains the items that have been manufactured, and is
closed immediately. Order *002* is the backorder that contains the items
that have yet to be manufactured, and remains open, to be completed at a
later date.

Once the remaining units can be manufactured, navigate to
`Manufacturing -->
Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and then select the backorder manufacturing
order. If all of the remaining units are manufactured immediately,
simply click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to close the
order.

If only some of the remaining units are manufactured immediately, create
another backorder for the remainder by following the steps detailed in
this section.

## Create a backorder in Shop Floor

Backorders for manufacturing orders can also be created from the *Shop
Floor* module.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In order to use the *Shop Floor* module, the *Work Orders* setting must
be enabled. To do so, navigate to
`Manufacturing --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, enable the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox, and then click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

To create a backorder from the *Shop Floor* module, begin by navigating
to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for multiple
units of a product, for which a backorder needs to be created.

On the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, select
the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and then click
the `Open Work Order
(external link icon)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
line of the work order to be processed. On the resulting
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, click
the `Open Shop Floor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to open
the *Shop Floor* module.

When accessed from a specific work order, the *Shop Floor* module opens
to the page for the work center where the order is configured to be
processed, and isolates the work order\'s card so that no other cards
are shown.

Complete the steps on the work order\'s card until the
`Register Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} step is
reached, and then click on it to open the
`Register Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Do **not** click the `# Units`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
on the right side of the step. Doing so automatically registers the full
amount of units as having been produced.
::::

On the `Register Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, enter the number of units produced in the
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Make sure the
number entered is *less* than the number of units listed to the right of
the field. Then, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Register Production pop-up window in the Shop Floor module.](manufacturing_backorders/register-production.png){.align-center}

The pop-up window disappears and the `# Units`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the work order\'s card updates to reflect the
number of units produced, as a fraction of the number of units for which
the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} was
originally created.

Next, click the `Mark as Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
at the bottom-right of the work order\'s card. The work order card
begins to fade away. Once it disappears completely, a new work order
card appears, titled with the original
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}\'s reference
number with a [-002]{.title-ref} tag added to the end of it.

This new reference number represents the backorder
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. The original
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}\'s reference
number now appears with a [-001]{.title-ref} tag added to the end of it
to distinguish it from the backorder
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

If the original `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} has no remaining work orders, it can be closed by selecting
the `All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter in the top
navigation of the *Shop Floor* module, and then clicking `Close
Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the bottom of the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}\'s card.

If the original `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} has remaining work orders that must be completed before it
can be closed, cards for these work orders appear on the *Shop Floor*
pages for the work centers where they are configured to be carried out.
They can be processed as normal, and additional backorders can be
created from their work order cards using the instructions detailed in
this section.

Once the current work order for the backorder
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is ready to be
processed, this can also be completed as normal, and an additional
backorder can be created from its work order card by following the
instructions detailed in this section.

After the final work order for the backorder
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} has been
completed, the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
can be closed by clicking the `Close Production`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button at the bottom of the work order\'s card.

# Scrap during manufacturing

During the manufacturing process, scrapping components or finished
products may be necessary when items are damaged, defective, or no
longer usable.

Tracking scrapped materials helps manufacturers monitor waste, identify
process issues, and account for production costs.

In Odoo, scrapped items are removed from physical inventory and moved to
a virtual location called *Virtual Locations/Scrap*. This location is
not a physical space---it is a way to log and track losses without
affecting real stock levels.

::: seealso
`Location types <../../inventory/warehouses_storage/inventory_management>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Scrap orders can be viewed by navigating to
`Inventory --> Operations --> Scrap`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Each scrap order shows the date and time the
order was created, along with the product and quantity that was
scrapped.

To view the total quantity of each item scrapped, navigate to
`Inventory -->
Configuration --> Locations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
then remove the `Internal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter
from the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar to display
all virtual locations. From the list, select the
`Virtual Locations/Scrap`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} location.
::::

## Navigate to the scrap window {#manufacturing/management/scrap-window}

Scrapping can be done in either the **Manufacturing** app or the **Shop
Floor** module, depending on the task.

**Manufacturing** app allows:

- Scrapping finished products (only if the
  `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is in the
  *Done* stage).
- Scrapping components (while the
  `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is in the
  *Draft* or *Confirmed* stage).

**Shop Floor** allows:

- Scrapping only components.

### Manufacturing app

To scrap a product from the **Manufacturing** app, go to
`Manufacturing -->
Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the desired
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

On the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, click
the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Actions)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, then choose
`Scrap`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu.

![MO with the cog\'s drop-down menu revealed, to show the Scrap option.](scrap_manufacturing/cog.png)

### Shop Floor

In **Shop Floor**, only components can be scrapped. Navigate to the
desired `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} card,
and then tap the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Actions)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and in the
`What do you want to do?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, select `Scrap`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Scrap pop-up window in the Shop Floor app.](scrap_manufacturing/shop-floor.png)

## Scrap pop-up window

After opening the `Scrap Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window using one of the methods `detailed
above <manufacturing/management/scrap-window>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, select the component or finished product being scrapped,
from the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu.

In the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, enter the
quantity being scrapped.

By default, the `Source Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field is set to the warehouse\'s pre-production location, while the
`Scrap Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set to the
`Virtual Locations/Scrap`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} location.
If either the source or scrap location should be changed, select a
different location from their respective drop-down menus.

Enable the `Replenish Scrapped Quantities`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox if a picking order should be created to
replace the scrapped component upon confirmation of the scrap order.
This option should only be enabled for warehouses with
`two-step <../basic_setup/two_step_manufacturing>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} or
`three-step <../basic_setup/three_step_manufacturing>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} manufacturing enabled, since components are not picked as
part of the
`one-step <../basic_setup/one_step_manufacturing>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} manufacturing process.

![The Scrap pop-up window.](scrap_manufacturing/scrap-window.png)

After filling out the `Scrap Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window, click the
`Scrap Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. After one or
more scrap orders have been created, a `Scraps`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button appears at the top of the screen. Click it
to view a list of all scrap orders for the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

# Split and merge manufacturing orders

In Odoo *Manufacturing*, it is possible to create manufacturing orders
for a single unit of an item, or multiple units of the same item. In
some cases, it may be necessary to split a manufacturing order that
contains multiple units into two or more orders, or to merge two or more
orders into a single order.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

A manufacturing order can only contain one unit of a product, or
multiple units of a single product that all use the same Bill of
Materials (BoM). As a result, it is only possible to merge manufacturing
orders when every order contains the same product being manufactured
with the same BoM.
::::

## Split manufacturing orders

To split a manufacturing order into multiple orders, begin by navigating
to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then select a manufacturing order. At the top of
the page, next to the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button,
the manufacturing order\'s reference number appears with a
`⚙️ (settings)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to it.

Click the `⚙️ (settings)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
open the general settings for the manufacturing order, then select
`Split`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Settings and Split buttons on a manufacturing order.](split_merge/settings-split.png){.align-center}

After selecting `Split`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
`Split production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears. In the `Split #`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
enter the number of manufacturing orders that the original order should
be split into, then click outside of the field. A table appears below,
with a line for each new manufacturing order that will be created by the
split. In the `Quantity To Produce`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column, enter the number of units that will be assigned to each new
manufacturing order. Finally, click `Split`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to split the manufacturing order.

![The Split production pop-up window for a manufacturing order.](split_merge/split-production-window.png){.align-center}

After clicking `Split`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the original
manufacturing order is split into the number of orders that was
specified in the `Split #`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. The
reference numbers for the new manufacturing orders are the reference
number for the original order with *-###* tags added to the end.

::: example
Manufacturing order *WH/MO/00012* is split into three separate orders.
The reference numbers for the new orders are *WH/MO/00012-001*,
*WH/MO/00012-002*, and *WH/MO/00012-003*.
:::

## Merge manufacturing orders

To merge two or more manufacturing orders into a single order, begin by
navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select the manufacturing orders that will be
merged by activating the checkbox to the left of the name of each order.

![Select manufacturing orders that will be merged by clicking the checkbox for each.](split_merge/select-orders.png){.align-center}

Once all manufacturing orders have been selected, click the
`Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top of the
page, then select `Merge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
drop-down menu.

![The Actions and Merge buttons on the Manufacturing Orders page.](split_merge/actions-merge.png){.align-center}

The selected manufacturing orders are merged into a single order. The
reference number for the new manufacturing order is the next sequential
number that has *not* already been assigned to an order.

::: example
The last reference number used for a manufacturing order was
*WH/MO/00012*. Two manufacturing orders, *WH/MO/00008* and
*WH/MO/00009*, are merged into a single order. The reference number for
the manufacturing order created by the merger is *WH/MO/00013*.
:::

In the `Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field for the
manufacturing order created by the merger, the reference numbers of the
manufacturing orders that were merged are listed.

::: example
Manufacturing orders *WH/MO/00009* and *WH/MO/00010* are merged to
create *WH/MO/00011*. The source field for *WH/MO/00011* lists both
*WH/MO/00009* and *WH/MO/00010*.

# Unbuild orders

In some cases, it is necessary to dismantle manufactured products into
their individual components. This may be required if too many units of a
product were built, or if the components of one product must be
reclaimed to use in the manufacturing of another.

In Odoo *Manufacturing*, products can be dismantled, and their
components returned to inventory, using *unbuild orders*. By using
unbuild orders to accomplish this task, inventory counts for the
finished product and its components remain accurate, based on the
quantity of products dismantled, and the quantity of components
reclaimed.

## Create unbuild order

A new unbuild order can be created by navigating to
`Manufacturing app --> Operations
--> Unbuild Orders`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Begin filling out the new unbuild order by selecting a
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to unbuild. After doing so,
the `Bill of Material`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
auto-populates with the corresponding bill of materials (BoM). If a
different `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
should be used, click on the `Bill of Material`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, and select it from the drop-down menu.

Alternatively, a specific `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} can be selected in the `Bill of Material`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field before selecting a product, which causes the
corresponding product to auto-populate in the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Next, specify the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the
product that is being unbuilt.

If the product being unbuilt was originally manufactured in a specific
manufacturing order (MO), select it in the
`Manufacturing Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

In the `Source Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
select the location where the product being unbuilt is currently stored.

In the `Destination Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
select the location where the reclaimed components are stored after the
unbuild order is completed.

If the *Lots & Serial Numbers* feature is enabled in the settings of the
*Inventory* app, a `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field appears on the unbuild order, which can be used
to specify the lot(s) or serial number(s) of the product being unbuilt,
if any are assigned.

If the Odoo database has been configured with multiple companies, a
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears on the
unbuild order, which can be used to specify the company that owns the
product being unbuilt.

Finally, once the product has been unbuilt, click the
`Unbuild`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top of the
order to confirm that it has been completed.

![A filled-out unbuild order.](unbuild_orders/unbuild-order.png){.align-center}

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

While it is possible to create unbuild orders for products that have
zero (or fewer) units on-hand, this is not advised, since it can lead to
inventory inconsistencies.

If an unbuild order is created for a product with zero (or fewer) units
on-hand, a pop-up window appears, warning the user that there is an
insufficient quantity to unbuild.

To ignore the warning, and proceed with the unbuild order, click
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the bottom of the pop-up
window. To return to the unconfirmed unbuild order, click
`Discard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, instead.

![The insufficient quantity pop-up that appears after trying to confirm an unbuild order
for a product with zero or fewer units on hand.](unbuild_orders/insufficient-quantity.png){.align-center}
::::

After completing an unbuild order, inventory counts automatically
update, based on the quantity of products unbuilt, and the quantity of
components reclaimed.

::: example
A [Coat Rack]{.title-ref} product is comprised of one [Wooden
Pole]{.title-ref} component and six [Wooden Dowel]{.title-ref}
components.

An unbuild order is created for one unit of the [Coat Rack]{.title-ref}.
Once the order is completed, the on-hand quantity of [Coat
Racks]{.title-ref} decreases by one, while the on-hand quantities of
[Wooden Poles]{.title-ref} and [Wooden Dowels]{.title-ref} increase by
one and six, respectively.
:::

## Scrap unusable components

In some cases, components may be unusable after the unbuilding process
is completed. To ensure that inventory counts accurately reflect the
quantity of usable components on-hand, any component that can no longer
be used should be removed from inventory using a `scrap order
<../../inventory/warehouses_storage/inventory_management/scrap_inventory>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

# Master production schedule

In Odoo\'s *Manufacturing* app, the *master production schedule* (MPS)
is used to manually plan manufacturing orders (MOs) and purchase orders
(POs), based on forecasted quantities of products and components.

By considering the impact of confirmed
`MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
`POs (purchase orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, along with
manually adjusted demand forecasts, the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can
be used to manage long-term product replenishment. This ensures the
continued availability of the necessary products and components.

Since the `MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} allows for manual intervention, it is useful for
replenishing products where the demand of existing sales orders (SOs)
does **not** reflect probable future demand.

::: example
A retail store sells artificial *Christmas trees* during the holiday
season. It is currently September, and the store has less than ten
Christmas tree `MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} confirmed for the month of December.

Despite the number of confirmed
`MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
procurement manager knows that the demand for Christmas trees in
December is going to be much higher, once the holiday season starts. As
a result, they manually enter a greater demand in the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, so
they can properly replenish the product in time for the increase in
customer demand.
:::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

It is essential to remember that the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is a
**MANUAL** tool. Adding a product to the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} does
not cause it to be manufactured or purchased automatically. The
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
simply suggests the amount of the product that should be replenished,
but requires user input to create the
`MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`POs (purchase orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that are used to
replenish it.

For this reason, it is recommended that the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
**NOT** be used alongside reordering rules for the same product. Because
reordering rules are an automated workflow, they conflict with the
manual replenishment method of
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
Using both, in unison, can lead to inaccurate forecasts and the creation
of unnecessary replenishment orders.
::::

## Enable and configure `MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} {#enable-and-configure-mps}

To use the `MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} feature, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and tick the
`Master Production Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox
in the `Planning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Finally,
click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

After enabling the `Master Production Schedule`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} feature, two new fields appear under it on the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page:
`Time Range`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Number of Columns`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The `Time Range`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is used to
select the period of time over which planning takes place, and offers
three options: `Monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Weekly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Daily`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. For example, if
`Monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} plans
the production requirements of products and components on a monthly
basis.

The `Number of Columns`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is used
to specify the quantity of the selected `Time Range`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} units shown on the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} page.
For example, if the `Time Range`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field is set to `Monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
[12]{.title-ref} is entered in the `Number of Columns`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} shows
one column for the next 12 months, starting with the current month.

If the values of the `Time Range`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Number of Columns`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields are
altered, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} again to save
the changes.

![The MPS setting in the Manufacturing app\'s settings.](use_mps/mps-setting.png){.align-center}

## `MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} dashboard {#mps-dashboard}

To open the `MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Planning --> Master Production
Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. The
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} view
appears as follows:

![The Master Production Schedule in the Manufacturing app.](use_mps/mps.png){.align-center}

The grey column on the left side of the screen shows a section for every
product added to the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, with
each product section being broken down into smaller rows. The
information shown in the rows depends on the filters selected in the
`Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar drop-down menu at the
top of the page. The default categories that appear in the rows are:

- `[Product] by [unit]`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  `fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}: the forecasted stock
  quantity at the beginning of each time period.
  `[Product]`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} are selectable buttons
  which open the product\'s page, or the forecast report for the
  product, respectively.

- `- Forecasted Demand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the demand
  forecast, which is entered manually. This represents an estimate of
  the demand for the product during each time period.

- `- Indirect Demand Forecast`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: while
  this is a default category, it **only** appears for products that are
  components of other products. It represents the demand for the
  component from existing MOs.

- `+ Suggested Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  quantity of the product that is suggested to be replenished through
  `MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
  `POs (purchase orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. To the right
  of the category title is a `Replenish`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} button, which is used to manually replenish the
  product, based on the quantity suggested to be replenished.

  <figure class="align-center">
  <img src="use_mps/replenish-button.png"
  alt="The Replenish button on the &quot;+ Suggested Replenishment&quot; row." />
  <figcaption>The "Replenish" button on the "+ Suggested Replenishment"
  row.</figcaption>
  </figure>

- `= Forecasted Stock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the quantity
  of the product forecasted to be in stock at the end of each time
  period, assuming that suggested replenishment numbers are fulfilled.

Altogether, these default categories form an equation:

$$\text{Forecasted Demand} + \text{Suggested Replenishment} = \text{Forecasted Stock}$$

In the case of components, the
`Indirect Demand Forecast`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is taken
into account as well.

The `- Forecasted Demand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`+ Suggested Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields
can be edited for any of the time periods to the right of the product
column. Doing so changes the equation, and updates the value displayed
in the `Forecasted Stock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Changing the value in the `+ Suggested Replenishment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field also makes an `fa-times`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(reset)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button appear
to the left of the field. Click the `fa-times`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(reset)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to
the field to reset its value back to the one calculated by the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

While the `MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} can be used with only the default categories enabled, it is
advisable to also enable the `Actual Demand`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} category. This is done by clicking the
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the right side of
the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar, and enabling the
`Actual Demand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option under the
`Rows`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} header.

With the `Actual Demand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option
enabled, the `- Forecasted Demand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
category changes to the `- Actual / Forecasted Demand`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} category. In addition to the manually entered
forecasted demand, this category also displays the confirmed demand for
the product, which is based on confirmed
`SOs (sales orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
::::

Each column to the right of the products column lists one unit of the
time period selected in the *Time Range* field on the *Manufacturing*
app *Settings* page (ex. months). The number of time period columns
corresponds to the value entered in the *Number of Columns* field.

The first time period column represents the current time period. For
example, if the `MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is configured to use months, the first column displays data
for the current month. On this first column, the
`+ Suggested Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
appears in one of five colors:

- `Green`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a replenishment order must
  be generated to keep stock at the `Safety
  Stock Target`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Gray`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a replenishment order has
  already been generated to keep stock at the
  `Safety Stock Target`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Yellow`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a replenishment order has
  already been generated, but the quantity it was created for is not
  enough to keep stock at the `Safety Stock Target`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- `Red`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a replenishment order has
  already been generated, but the quantity it was created for puts the
  amount of stock above the `Safety Stock Target`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.

The `+ Suggested Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
appears white, if no replenishment order has been generated, and it is
not necessary to generate one at the current moment.

## Add a product

To use `MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} to manage the replenishment of a product, navigate to
`Manufacturing app
--> Planning --> Master Production Schedule`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. At the top of the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} page,
click `Add a
Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open the
`Add a Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Products **must** be properly configured to be replenished through the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

In the case of manufactured products, the *Manufacture* route must be
selected in the *Routes* section of the *Inventory* tab, on the
product\'s form.

In the case of products that are purchased, the *Buy* route must be
selected in the *Routes* section of the *Inventory* tab, on the
product\'s form. Additionally, a vendor and the price they sell the
product for must also be specified on the *Purchase* tab.
::::

On the pop-up window, select the product to add in the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu. If the
product is replenished through manufacturing, select the product\'s
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in the `Bill of
Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Selecting a BoM when adding a product to the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} also
adds any components listed on the BoM. If it is not necessary to manage
the replenishment of components through the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
simply leave the `Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field blank.
::::

If the database is configured with multiple warehouses, a
`Production Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears
on the `Add a Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.
Use this field to specify which warehouse the product is replenished to.

In the `Safety Stock Target`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
specify the minimum quantity of the product that should be kept
available for orders at all times. For example, if there should always
be 20 units of the product available for order fulfillment, enter
[20]{.title-ref} in the `Safety Stock Target`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

In the `Minimum to Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
enter the minimum product quantity for orders created to replenish the
product. For example, if [5]{.title-ref} is entered in this field,
replenishment orders for the product include a minimum of five units.

In the `Maximum to Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
enter the maximum product quantity for orders created to replenish the
product. For example, if [100]{.title-ref} is entered in this field,
replenishment orders for the product include a maximum of 100 units.

Finally, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add the
product to the `MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. The product now appears on the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} page
each time it is opened. If a `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} was selected in the `Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field of the `Add a Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window, any components listed on the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} appear on the
page, as well.

![The Add a Product pop-up window in the MPS.](use_mps/add-a-product.png){.align-center}

### Edit a product

After adding a product to the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, it
may be necessary to change the replenishment values entered on the
`Add a Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window. To do
so, click the `# ≤…≤ #`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to the
immediate right of the `Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button, on the `+ Suggested
Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} row, below the
product\'s name.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The first and second number displayed on the `# ≤…≤ #`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button correspond to the values entered in the
`Minimum to Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Maximum to Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields when
adding the product to the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

For example, if [5]{.title-ref} was entered in the
`Minimum to Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and
[100]{.title-ref} was entered in the
`Maximum to Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, the
button appears as `5 ≤…≤
100`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

Clicking the `# ≤…≤ #`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button opens
the `Edit Production Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window. This pop-up window is the same as the
`Add a Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, except
that the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields cannot be
edited.

On the `Edit Production Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window, enter the desired values in the
`Safety Stock Target`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Minimum to Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Maximum to
Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields. Then, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the changes.

### Remove a product

To remove a product from the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, tick
the checkbox to the left of its name. Then, click the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button at the top of the screen, and select
`Delete`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the resulting drop-down
menu. Finally, click `Ok`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
`Confirmation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

Deleting a product from the
`MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
removes it, along with all of its data. If the product is re-added, its
replenishment values must be reconfigured.

## `MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} replenishment {#mps-replenishment}

Products in the `MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} can be replenished in one of three ways:

- Click the `Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the
  top of the screen to generate replenishment orders for every product
  below its `Safety Stock Target`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
  the current month.
- Click the `Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
  right side of the `+ Suggested
  Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} row of a specific
  product, to generate a replenishment order for that specific product.
- Tick the checkbox to the left of the product name of one or more
  products. Then, click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top of the
  screen, and select `Replenish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from
  the resulting drop-down menu. Doing so generates a replenishment order
  for each selected product.

The type of replenishment order generated corresponds to the route
selected on the *Inventory* tab of the product\'s form:

- If the *Buy* route is selected, an
  `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
  generated to replenish the product.
  `RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can be
  selected by navigating to the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"} app. Any
  `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} generated
  by the `MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} lists `MPS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in its
  `Source Document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
- If the *Manufacture* route is selected, an
  `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is generated
  to replenish the product.
  `MOs (manufacturing orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can be
  selected by navigating to
  `Manufacturing app --> Operations --> Manufacturing
  Orders`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Any
  `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} generated by
  the `MPS (Master Production Schedules)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  lists `MPS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in its
  `Source Document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

# Work center time off

In Odoo, *work centers* are used to carry out manufacturing operations
at specific locations. However, if a work center cannot be used for some
reason, work orders begin to pile up at the work center until it is
operational again.

As a result, it is necessary to make the work center unavailable in Odoo
so new work orders are routed to alternative work centers that are
operational. Using Odoo\'s **Time Off** app, it is possible to designate
a work center as being unavailable for a set period of time. Doing so
ensures manufacturing operations can continue until the impacted work
center is available again.

## Configuration

Before a work center can be designated as unavailable, the Odoo platform
must be properly configured. First, it is necessary to enable
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. This
allows the *Time Off* smart button to appear on each work center\'s
*Working Hours* page.

Next, install the **Time Off** app. This is the app used for managing
time off for all resources within Odoo, including employees and work
centers.

To do so, navigate to the `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
app, then search [Time Off]{.title-ref} in the search bar. The card for
the `Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app should be the only
one that appears on the page. Click the `Install`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the card to install the app.

The last step is to properly configure work centers. For this workflow,
it is necessary to have at least two work centers: one that is made
unavailable, and a second that receives the work orders that the other
cannot accept. If no second work center is configured, Odoo cannot route
work orders away from the unavailable work center, and they pile up in
its queue.

To create a work center, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Configuration --> Work
Centers --> New`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

::: seealso
For a full guide to work center creation, refer to the documentation on
`work centers
<../advanced_configuration/using_work_centers>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
:::

Make sure both work centers have the same equipment listed under the
`Equipment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. This ensures
operations carried out at one work center can also be performed at the
other.

On the work center that is made unavailable, select the second work
center from the `Alternative Workcenters`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu. Now, Odoo knows to send work orders to
the second work center when the first is unavailable for any reason.

![A work center form configured with an alternative work center.](work_center_time_off/alternative-work-center-selection.png){.align-center}

## Add time off for a work center

With configuration completed, time off can now be assigned to a work
center. Begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing app --> Configuration --> Work Centers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and selecting the affected work center. Click the
`oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Internal link)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the right
side of the `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down
menu, to open the working hours page for the work center.

![The Working Hours \"External link\" button on the work center form.](work_center_time_off/working-hours-button.png){.align-center}

The working hours page displays the standard working hours for the work
center. With developer mode activated, a `fa-plane`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button
appears at the top of the page. Click it to open the
`Resource Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.

On this page, click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
configure a new time-off entry. On the time-off form, note the
`Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the work center closure
(e.g. broken equipment, maintenance, etc.), select the affected work
center as the `Resource`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and choose
a `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to specify the period
during which the work center is unavailable.

![The \"Resource Time Off\" form.](work_center_time_off/time-off-form.png){.align-center}

## Alternative work center planning

Once a work center is within its specified time-off period, work orders
sent to it can be automatically routed to an alternative work center
using the *Plan* button.

Begin by creating a new manufacturing order (MO), by navigating to
`Manufacturing app
--> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders --> New`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. On the
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form, specify
a `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that uses the unavailable
work center for one of its operations. Click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to confirm the
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

On the confirmed `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, select the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. By default, the unavailable work center is
specified in the `Work Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column. There is also a `Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
at the top left of the page.

Click `Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the work center
listed in the `Work Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column of
the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab is
automatically changed to the alternative work center.

<figure class="align-center">

<figcaption>After clicking <code class="interpreted-text"
role="guilabel">Plan</code>, the work order is rescheduled at <code
class="interpreted-text" role="guilabel">Alternative Assembly
Line</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>

Once the time-off period for the unavailable work center ends, Odoo
recognizes the work center is available again. At this point, clicking
the `Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button does not route work
orders to an alternative work center unless the first one is at
capacity.

# ECO types and stages

Engineering change orders (ECOs) are categorized by the type of change
they represent and their statuses are tracked via stages. Both
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} types
and stages are defined by the user and can be customized to the specific
needs of a business or industry.

## ECO types

Each `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
type separates `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} into different projects in the
`PLM Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, ensuring
collaborators and stakeholders only view and assist with relevant
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} improvements.

::: example
An electronic chip manufacturer uses five
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} types:
[New Product Introduction]{.title-ref}, [BOM Updates]{.title-ref},
[Component Change]{.title-ref}, [Product Improvement]{.title-ref}, and
[Firmware Update]{.title-ref}. In their configuration, engineers can
spend time exclusively on
`ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in the
[Component Change]{.title-ref} and [Firmware Update]{.title-ref} types,
while designers see `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} in the [New Product Introduction]{.title-ref} type,
allowing each discipline to focus only on those changes that require
their domain expertise.

![Example of several custom ECO types.](eco_type/eco-type-example.png)
:::

### Create an ECO type

To access and manage ECO types, navigate to
`PLM app --> Configuration --> ECO
Types`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Create a new ECO type by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. On the new `ECO Types`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} form, fill in the following information:

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the name of the
  `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} type,
  which will organize all of the
  `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} of
  this *type* in a project.
- `Email Alias`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if this optional
  field is filled, emails submitted to this email address automatically
  generate `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} in the left-most stage of this
  `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} type.

::: example
The [Formulation change]{.title-ref}
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} type is
used to organize and track related
`ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in a
single project. Configuring the `Email Alias`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field generates
`ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in the
[Formulation change]{.title-ref} project sent to the email address,
[pawlish-change@pawlished-glam.odoo.com]{.title-ref}.

![Example of an ECO type.](eco_type/create-eco-type.png)
:::

### Edit ECO types

Modify existing `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} type names and email aliases by navigating to the
`PLM app -->
Configuration --> ECO Types`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
page. There, click on the desired
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} type
from the list.

On the form for each `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} type, edit the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Email Alias`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields.

## Stages {#plm/eco/stage-config}

Within the `Engineering Change Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} Kanban view for a specific
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} type,
*stages* are milestones used to identify the progress of the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} before
the changes are ready to be applied. By default, Odoo uses
[New]{.title-ref}, [In Progress]{.title-ref}, [Validated]{.title-ref},
and [Effective]{.title-ref}, but these are fully customizable to the
specific life cycle of an
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} type.

![Default stages for an ECO type.](eco_type/eco-stage-defaults.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The [Effective]{.title-ref} stage is folded by default to avoid listing
every single `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} that has gone into effect. See
`Closing stage <plm/eco/closing-stage>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
for more on this configuration.
::::

`Verification stages <plm/eco/verification-stage>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} require a designated user to approve, ensuring that changes
do not proceed until the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} changes
have been reviewed by the appropriate stake holders.
`Closing stages<plm/eco/closing-stage>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
that can apply changes put `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and operations changes into immediate effect, changing all
pending and future `MO (Manufacturing
orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to the latest
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} version.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The most common practice is to have at least one *verification* stage,
which is a stage with a required approver, and one *closing* stage,
which stores `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} that have been either cancelled or approved for use as the
next production `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.
::::

::: seealso
`Approvals<../management/approvals>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

### Verification stages {#plm/eco/verification-stage}

To configure a verification stage, hover over the intended stage, and
select the `fa-gear`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Actions)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, click
`Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open a pop-up window and
check the box for `Allow to apply changes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Next, add an approver in the `Approvers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, by clicking `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and specifying the `Role`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of the reviewer, the `User`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and an `Approval
Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of
`Is required to approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. See
`more about approval types.
<plm/approvals/approval-type>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

The approver listed is automatically notified when
`ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are
dropped in the stage specified in the pop-up window. Once finished,
click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
`../management/approvals`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

### Closing stages {#plm/eco/closing-stage}

Click an `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
type from `PLM app --> Overview`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
to open the Kanban view of
`ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} of
this type.

To configure a closing stage that applies
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, edit the stage
and tick the boxes for `Folded in kanban view`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Allow to apply changes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `Final Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
When ECO cards are placed in a stage that will *Allow to apply changes*,
then any `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
operations changes validated in the
`ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} will
immediately be put into effect. To create a cancelled stage, create or
edit a stage and tick the boxes for
`Folded in kanban view`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Final Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
`ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in
this stage are removed from the pipeline, but will not make changes.

::: example
The closing stage, [Effective]{.title-ref} is configured by checking the
`Folded in kanban view`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Allow to apply changes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Final Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options

# Engineering change orders

::: {#plm/eco}
Utilize *engineering change orders* (*ECOs*) to track, implement, and
revert change versions made to products, and
`bills of materials <../../manufacturing/basic_setup/bill_configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
:::

Engineering change orders can be created:

1.  `directly in the ECO type <plm/eco/create-eco>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
2.  automatically from feedback submitted to the
    `ECO type's email alias <plm/eco/eco-type>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

## Create ECO {#plm/eco/create-eco}

To create a new `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, begin by navigating to the **PLM** app. Then, select the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} type
that should be used to track the progress of the change. On the
`Engineering Change Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page,
click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
top-left corner.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`ECO types <eco_type>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} categorize and
organize change orders. Doing so can ensure that employees only view the
`ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
related to their responsibilities, whether it involves new product
introductions, targeted product line updates, or regulatory compliance
fulfillment.
::::

On the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
form, fill in the following fields accordingly:

- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is a brief summary of
  the improvement.

- `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: specifies the
  `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} type
  project for organizing the
  `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

- `Apply on`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} determines if the
  `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  changes the `Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  the `Product Only`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} indicates the product
  being improved.

- `Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} specifies the
  changed `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. It
  auto-populates if the product in `Product`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field has an existing
  `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. If multiple
  `BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} exist,
  select the intended radio options from the drop-down menu.

- `Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} represents the
  assignee in charge of this
  `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
  (Optional)

- `Effective`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} specifies when the
  `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  becomes live. Choosing `As soon as
  possible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} means the
  `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  applies to the production `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} as soon as an authorized user
  `applies the changes <plm/eco/apply-changes>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}. `At Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with a
  specific date selected will only apply the
  `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} at that date,
  making it easier to track the version history of the
  `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in
  production.

- `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are assigned to
  `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for
  prioritization and organization. Create a new tag by typing the name
  in the field and selecting `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  from the drop-down menu. (Optional)

After filling out the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} form, click the `Start Revision`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to begin implementing the changes.

By pressing `Start Revision`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, three
actions occur:

1.  The `Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button
    appears, storing the relevant files of the
    `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
2.  A copy of the production `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} is stored in the newly-appeared
    `Revision`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button of the
    `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. The
    next available version number (e.g., [V2]{.title-ref},
    [V3]{.title-ref}, \...) is also assigned to keep track of all
    `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} versions.
3.  The stages of the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are displayed
    in the top-right corner of the
    `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

## Change components

To modify the components in a
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, click the
`Revision`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button on an
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
access the new version of the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Odoo
distinguishes the non-production version of the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} from the
current version, by flagging the test
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} with a large
`Archived`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tag.

::: example
After clicking the `Start Revision`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button for an `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} for the product, [\[D_0045 Stool\]]{.title-ref}, make
changes to the product\'s `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} by clicking the `Revision`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button. Doing so opens the archived
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, marked with a
large red `Archived`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} flag.

![Show the archived Bill of Materials.](engineering_change_orders/archived-bom.png)
:::

On the new `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, in
the `Components`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, proceed to
modify the components list, by changing the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of existing components, adding new components using the
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and removing
components with the `🗑️ (trash)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon.

### Compare changes

To compare a revised `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} to the previous version, navigate to the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for that
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in either of
these ways:

1.  From the revised `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"}, click the
    `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} name
    (for example, [ECO005: Improve\...]{.title-ref}) in the breadcrumbs
    located in the top-left corner.
2.  From the `PLM Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click
    the `Engineering Changes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
    on the `BOM Updates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} Kanban card.
    Click the Kanban card for the appropriate
    `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
    open it.

On the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
form, a new `BoM Changes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
displays the differences between the current
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and the new
version.

Blue text indicates new components added to the revised
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that are not in
the production `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
Black text represents updates shared by both
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, while red
text indicates components removed in the revised
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Changes and tests are encapsulated in the revised
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and do **not**
affect the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
currently used in production. That is, until the
`changes are applied <plm/eco/apply-changes>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

## Change operations

To modify the operations in a
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, click the
`Revision`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button on an
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
access the archived, new version of the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

In the new `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
version, switch to the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab to view and edit `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} operations. To make changes, select each operation, which
opens the corresponding `Open:
Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

:::: note
::: title

The `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab is *not*
available by default. To enable it, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and check the `Work
Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box.
::::

Make changes to any of the fields in the
`Open: Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window,
then click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} once completed.

Create new operations by clicking the `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, and remove new operations by clicking the
`Archive Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

### Compare changes

To compare a revised operations to the previous version, navigate to the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in either of
these ways:

1.  From the revised `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"}, click the
    `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} name
    (for example, [ECO005: Improve\...]{.title-ref}) in the breadcrumbs
    located in the top-left corner
2.  From the `PLM Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select
    the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
    type card, and then the correct
    `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} from
    the Kanban view.

On the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
form, a new `Operation Changes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
displays the differences between the current production
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and the new
version.

Blue text indicates new operations added to the revised
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that do not yet
exist in the production `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. Black text represents updates shared by both
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, while red
text indicates operations removed in the revised
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Modifications to the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} in an `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} will **not** affect the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} used in
production. That is, until the
`changes are applied <plm/eco/apply-changes>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

In the `Operation Changes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, each
row of details, beneath the columns in the table, reflect the following
information:

- `Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Name of the operation
  that was modified.
- `Step`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: specifies the quality
  control point, visible when the operation includes detailed
  instructions.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To check for instructions, click the operation line item in the
`Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of a
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Then, in the
`Open: Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window,
look for the `Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button displayed at the top.
::::

::: example
The [Assembly]{.title-ref} `Operation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} includes [10]{.title-ref} detailed
`Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to complete it.

![Show Instructions smart button to check whether an operation has additional
instructions.](engineering_change_orders/instructions-smart-button.png)
:::

- `Step Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} details the type of
  quality control for further instructions in the operation.
- `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} corresponds with the colored
  text to specify how the revised
  `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} differs from
  the production `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"}. Operation change types can be `Add`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Remove`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Update`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Work Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} specifies the work
  center at which the operation is performed.
- `Manual Duration Change`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} refers to
  the change in the `Default Duration`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field in the `Open: Operations`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} pop-up window, which specifies the expected time for
  completing the operation.

::: example
The `Operation Changes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab compares
the production `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
with the revised `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} in the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

In the revised `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
a new [Assembly]{.title-ref} `Operation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} at the `Work Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
[Assembly Line 1]{.title-ref} is added. In addition, the expected
duration of the operation is [20.00]{.title-ref} minutes, as specified
by the `Manual Duration Change`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To supplement the [Assembly]{.title-ref} operation, two quality control
point instructions are added:

1.  The first is the `Step`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    [QCP00039]{.title-ref}, a `Step Type`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} to `Register
    Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of components.
2.  The second `Step`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
    [QCP00034]{.title-ref}, an [Instructions]{.title-ref}
    `Step Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that provides
    additional assembly details.

![Operation Changes tab in an \|ECO\|.](engineering_change_orders/operation-changes.png)

## Apply changes {#plm/eco/apply-changes}

After verifying the changes, move the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to a
`verification stage <plm/eco/stage-config>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, which are stages that require approval before the revised
changes can be applied to the production
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Once the approvers accept the changes, the
`Apply Changes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button becomes
available. Click this button, and the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
automatically moved to a closing stage. The changes are applied, which
archives the original production
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and the
revised `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} becomes
the new production `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

### Verify changes

To ensure the changes are live, from the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} where
the `Apply Changes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button was
pressed, return to the revised
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by clicking the
`Revision`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button.

On the revised `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
the large red `Archived`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} flag is
removed.

To further verify the changes, check the production
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by going to
`Manufacturing
app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
and select the product.

Then, on the product form, click the
`Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button, and
select the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} from
the list. In the `Miscellaneous`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
of the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
`Version`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is updated to match
the version number shown on the `Revision`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button of the latest
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

::: example
After applying the changes of the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the
`keyboard <plm/eco/example-keyboard>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
view the version of the current keyboard
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in the
`Miscellaneous`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Here, the
`Version`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} number has been updated to
[2]{.title-ref}, matching the [V2]{.title-ref} that appears in the
`Revision`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button of the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

![View current BOM version in the Miscellaneous tab.](engineering_change_orders/bom-version.png)

On the
`quality control point <quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} form, ensure the following form fields are accurately filled
out to give detailed instructions for operators:

- `Title`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: rename to give a concise
  description of the new instruction.
- `Control per`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: using the drop-down
  menu, determine whether this instruction applies broadly for the
  `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, specifically for this
  `Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} *only*, or a particular
  `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the product.
- `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: categorizes the control
  point type. From the drop-down menu, select
  `Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to detail an
  instruction for the worker. To receive input from the workers, select
  the `Take a Picture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Register Consumed Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Print Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or other
  `quality check options

# Version control

Use Odoo\'s *Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)* to manage previous
versions of bills of materials (BoMs). Store former assembly
instructions, component details, and past product design files while
keeping the past details out of the production
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Easily revert to previous `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} versions, when needed. Additionally, use *PLM* to trace
which `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} version
was active on specific dates for recalls or customer complaints.

Every `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} version
is stored in an *engineering change order* (ECO) for organized testing
and improvements without disrupting normal manufacturing operations.

::: seealso
`Engineering change order <plm/eco>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

## Current BoM version

To see the current version of the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} used in
production, go to `PLM app --> Master
Data --> Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
select the desired `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} from the list. Then, switch to the
`Miscellaneous`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, where the
currently live `Version`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is displayed.

## Version history

To manage all former, current, and future versions of a
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, begin by
navigating to
`Manufacturing app --> Products --> Bills of Materials`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click the desired
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

From the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} page,
click the `ECO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button, and
switch to list view by selecting the
`≣ (four horizontal lines)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon on
the top right corner.

:::: note

Next, filter by `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
view: the revision history of the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
`Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} user who applied the
change, and the `Effective Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of
the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Click each `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text

A workaround for checking when the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} went live is by
navigating to the chatter, and hovering over the time the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} was
moved to the `closing stage <plm/eco/stage-config>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

## Design files

Attach computer-aided design (CAD) files, PDFs, images, or other design
material to the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
itself.

To do so, navigate to
`PLM app --> Master Data --> Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the desired
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. On the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, navigate to
the *chatter*, and click the `📎 (paperclip)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon.

The files associated with the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are displayed
in the `Files`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. To add more
design files, select the `Attach files`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

![Show paperclip icon in the chatter to attach files to a BoM.](version_control/attach-files.png){.align-center}

### Manage design files in an ECO

Add, modify, and remove files in an
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Once
the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
approved and applied, the new files are automatically linked to the
production `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
Archived files are removed from the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, but are still
accessible in the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

To manage the design files in the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, begin
by navigating to `PLM app --> Changes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and choose the desired
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Next,
open the `Attachments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page by
clicking the `Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button.

Hover over each attachment to reveal the
`︙ (three vertical dots)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon. From
there, choose whether to `Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Remove`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Download`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the file. Any changes made
to these files are contained within the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and
will only apply to the production
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} once the
`changes are applied <plm/eco/apply-changes>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

::: example
In the [Create 60% keyboard]{.title-ref}
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
design files are from the original [100% keyboard]{.title-ref}
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. To replace the
keyboard PDF, begin by selecting the `Documents`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button.

![Show \*Documents\* smart button from an active ECO.](version_control/documents-smart-button.png){.align-center}

On the `Attachments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, hover over
the [100% keyboard manual.pdf]{.title-ref} design file, and click the
`︙ (three vertical dots)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon.
Then, click the `Remove`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option to
archive the file.

Next, on the same `Attachments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page,
click the `Upload`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to upload
the new design file, named [60% keyboard manual]{.title-ref}.

![View of \*Attachments\* page from the \*Documents\* smart button. Displays one archived and
one newly added attachment.](version_control/attachments.png){.align-center}
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Archived files are **not** permanently deleted --- they can still be
accessed in the previous
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, or as
an archived file in the latest
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, where
the archival occurred.
::::

## Apply rebase

Odoo simplifies merge conflict resolution for concurrent
`ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} on the
same product.

Conflicts can occur when the production
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is updated
while other `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} are modifying the previous version. Differences between the
new and previous production
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are displayed
in the `Previous Eco Bom Changes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, visible only in this scenario.

To resolve conflicts and retain
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} changes,
click the `Apply Rebase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

::: example
Two `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
[ECO0011]{.title-ref} and [ECO0012]{.title-ref}, are created when the
current `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} version
is [5]{.title-ref}. In [ECO0011]{.title-ref}, a new component, [Space
stabilizer]{.title-ref}, is added, and the changes are applied. This
means the current `BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} version has become [6]{.title-ref}.

![Apply changes to an ECO to update the production BOM.](version_control/branch-change.png){.align-center}

This means [ECO0012]{.title-ref} is modifying an outdated
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. As shown in
the `Previous Eco Bom
Changes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is missing the
[Space stabilizer]{.title-ref}.

To ensure the changes applied by [ECO0011]{.title-ref} are kept when the
changes occur in [ECO0012]{.title-ref}, click the
`Apply Rebase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to apply the
previous `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
changes, without affecting the changes already made to
[ECO0012]{.title-ref}.

## Add approvers

To add an approver, first go to the `PLM app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click on the project card of an
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} type to
open the Gantt view of the
`ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

On the `Engineering Change Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
page, hover over the intended stage, and select the
`fa-gear`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Actions)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon. Then, click `Edit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to open a pop-up window.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Approvers can be added to any stage, but they are most essential in the
*verification* stage, before the final *closing* stage which applies the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
updates the `BoM (Bill of
Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. This allows stakeholders to
control how and when changes are made.

See the documentation about
`stage types <plm/eco/stage-config>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for
more information.
::::

In the `Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage pop-up window,
click the `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button,
located under `Approvals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, type
in the position or title of the approver under `Role`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} (e.g. [Engineering Manager]{.title-ref}, [Quality
Team]{.title-ref}, etc.), and select the relevant
`User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu.

### Approval types {#plm/approvals/approval-type}

Next, set the `Approval Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Is required to approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Approves,
but the approval is optional`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Comments only`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: example
Assign the [CTO]{.title-ref}, \"Mitchell Admin,\" as a required approver
for `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in
the [Validated]{.title-ref} stage in the [New Product
Introduction]{.title-ref}
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} type.

Approvals from the quality and marketing teams are **not** required to
apply changes to the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} because their `Approval Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is set to `Approves, but the approval is
optional`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Comments only`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, respectively.

![Set an approver that \"Is required to approve\" ECOs in the \"Validated\" stage.](approvals/approvers.png)
:::

## Manage approvals

Approvers can track their to-do approvals by navigating to the
`PLM app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and selecting the
card for an `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} type, which shows the count of open tasks assigned to them.

![Display count of validations to-do and buttons to open filtered list of ECOs.](approvals/validation-overview.png)

Here\'s what each button on an
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} project
card does:

1.  The `# Engineering Changes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    button displays a count of in-progress
    `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} of
    this ECO type. Clicking the button opens the Gantt view of the
    `Engineering Change Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.
2.  `My Validations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} displays a count
    of `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
    the approver must accept or reject. Clicking on this button displays
    `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
    pending approval or rejected (marked with the red
    `Blocked`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} state).
3.  The `All Validations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
    shows the count of
    `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
    awaiting approval or rejected by any approver. Clicking it reveals
    these pending `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"}.
4.  `To Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} displays a count of
    `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
    which the user needs to apply changes. Clicking on the button
    displays all the
    `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
    approve, and apply changes to, in the verification stage.

`ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} marked
with the green `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage have
already been approved, and the user needs to click on the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to enter
the form view, and click the `Apply Changes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

# Purchase Analysis report

The *Purchase Analysis* report provides statistics about products
purchased using Odoo\'s **Purchase** app. This data is useful for
gaining a deeper understanding of key metrics related to purchase orders
(POs), including the quantity of products ordered and received, the
amount of time it takes to receive purchased products, and more.

To open the Purchase Analysis report, navigate to
`Purchase app --> Reporting -->
Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Purchase Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report is one
of many reports available across the Odoo app suite. This documentation
only covers the measures specific to the
`Purchase Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report, along
with a few use case examples.

For a full overview of the basic features available in most Odoo
reports, see the documentation on
`reporting essentials <../../../essentials/reporting>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
::::

## Measures

*Measures* refer to the various datasets that can be displayed on the
`Purchase Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report, with each
dataset representing a key statistic about
`POs (purchase orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or products. To
choose a measure, click the `Measures`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} button,
and select one of the options from the drop-down menu:

- `# of Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The number of
  `PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} order lines,
  across all `POs (purchase orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
- `Average Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The average cost of
  `POs (purchase orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
- `Days to Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The number of
  days it takes to confirm a `PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"}.
- `Days to Receive`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The number of
  days it takes to receive the products in a
  `PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
- `Gross Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The total weight of
  purchased products.
- `Qty Billed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The quantity of a
  product (or products) for which the vendor has already been billed.
- `Qty Ordered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The quantity of a
  product (or products) ordered.
- `Qty Received`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The quantity of an
  ordered product (or products) received.
- `Qty to be Billed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The quantity of
  an ordered product (or products) for which the vendor has yet to be
  billed.
- `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The total amount spent,
  including tax.
- `Untaxed Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The total amount
  spent, excluding tax. This measure is selected by default.
- `Volume`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The total volume of
  ordered products, for products which are measured by volume.
- `Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The total count of
  `POs (purchase orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Only one measure can be selected at a time when one of the
`fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(graph view)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options is enabled.
However, multiple measures, and varying group-by criteria (on the x and
y axes), can be selected when using the
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(pivot table)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

## Use case: determine days to receive products from each vendor {#purchase/purchase-analysis-example}

One possible use case for the `Purchase Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} report is determining how long each vendor takes to
deliver purchased items. This allows companies to make better informed
decisions about which vendors they want to purchase from.

::: example
A local bike shop, *Bike Haus*, sells high-quality unicycles, bicycles,
tricycles, and all the accessories needed to ride and maintain them.
They purchase their inventory from a few different vendors, and then
sell those products on to customers through their storefront.

Recently, Bike Haus has decided to have their purchasing manager, David,
look into how long it has taken each of their vendors to deliver the
items they\'ve purchased during the current year, 2024.

David starts by navigating to
`Purchase app --> Reporting --> Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and selecting the
`fa-bar-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} (bar chart) graph type at
the top of the report.

Next, he clicks the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(toggle)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the right of the
search bar to open its drop-down menu. In the
`Confirmation Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter section,
he makes sure that **only** the `2024`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} filter is enabled. Then, he selects the
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option in the
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, before clicking
away from the drop-down menu to close it.

Finally, David clicks on the `Measures`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
drop-down menu, and selects the `Days to Receive`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option.

With all of these options enabled, the
`Purchase Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report shows a
bar chart, with one bar for each vendor, representing the average number
of days it takes to receive products purchased from the vendor.

Using this data, David can see that it takes Bike Friends over 4.5 days,
on average, to deliver purchased products. This is more than four times
the amount of time it takes any other vendor.

Based on these findings, David makes the decision to reduce the quantity
of products purchased from Bike Friends.

![The Purchase report, showing the average days to receive products from vendors.](analyze/dtr.png){.align-center}
:::

## Use case: compare vendor POs for two time periods

Another use for the `Purchase Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} report is to compare key statistics about
`POs (purchase orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for two different
time periods, for a specific vendor. By doing so, it is easy to
understand how purchases from the vendor have increased or decreased.

::: example
Following the
`previous example <purchase/purchase-analysis-example>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, it has been one month since Bike Haus decided to reduce the
quantity of products purchased from Bike Friends, one of their
retailers. Bike Haus\' purchasing manager, David, wants to understand
the impact this decision has had on the amount of money they have spent
on Bike Friends products.

David starts by navigating to
`Purchase app --> Reporting --> Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, he selects the
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(pivot table)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option at the top of
the screen.

In the search bar, he types [Bike Friends]{.title-ref}, and clicks
`Enter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, so the report only shows
data for purchases from Bike Friends.

Then, David clicks the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(toggle)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the right of the
search bar to open its drop-down menu. In the
`Confirmation Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, he leaves
the `June`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`2024`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filters enabled. He also
selects `Confirmation
Date: Previous Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Comparison`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, before clicking
away from the drop-down menu to close it.

Next, David clicks on the `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} drop-down menu. He leaves
the `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Untaxed Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} datasets enabled, and
disables the `Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} datasets.

Finally, David clicks the `fa-minus-square-o`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button above the
rows on the pivot table, and selects the `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option.

With all of these options configured, the
`Purchase Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report shows a
pivot table comparing purchase data for the current month, June, with
the previous month, May.

The pivot table is broken down into two main columns: one for the
untaxed total spent, and one for the taxed total spent. These columns
are further broken down into three smaller columns: the amount spent in
May, the amount spent in June, and the variation between the two months,
represented as a percentage.

On the left side of the pivot table, one row is shown for each product
purchased from Bike Friends during June. Using this report, David is
able to see that Bike Haus has spent much less money on products
purchased from Bike Friends, compared to the previous month.

# EDI purchase-to-sales order import

Electronic data interchange (EDI) enables companies using different
software systems to exchange information in a standardized, structured
format.

In Odoo, a *purchase order* (PO) can be exported as an XML file and
imported as a *sales order* (SO) into another Odoo database, removing
the need for manual entry of products, quantities, prices, and other key
information.

The workflow in this document describes how buyers and sellers exchange
data directly between their Odoo databases. As an alternative, sellers
can receive a PDF version of the request for quotation (RFQ) by email
and `upload it directly in their Sales dashboard
<purchase/advanced/rfq-upload>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. **This
method is simpler** but does not use the XML-based exchange described in
the document.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Exported XMLs follow the [UBL
schema](https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/upgrade-3/syntax/Order/tree/). When
exchanging data between two Odoo databases, this schema remains
compatible.

However, implementing custom developments for software that does not
support the UBL schema may introduce additional complexity.
::::

## Roles and configuration

To facilitate the `EDI (Electronic Data Exchange)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} workflow, two companies are involved: the buyer (the
company placing the order) and the seller (the company fulfilling the
order). Each company has specific roles and configurations.

### Buyer database

The buyer database is responsible for creating and confirming purchase
orders. Prerequisites include:

1.  (required) `installing <general/install>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} the **Purchase** app
2.  (optional) adding vendors (the sellers in this workflow) as
    `portal users
    <../../../general/users/portal>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

### Seller database

The seller database is responsible for receiving and processing sales
orders. The only prerequisite is
`installing <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
**Sales** app.

## Workflow

### Buyer\'s process

To begin, the buyer (in their database) navigates to the
`Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app to create a
`RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Set the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the portal user
representing the seller, and `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} the `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. Doing so converts it into a `purchase order
<../manage_deals/rfq>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

::: example
`PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} from the buyer\'s
database. The `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is the
seller\'s portal user account, Joel.

![Example PO. The Vendor is the seller\'s portal user account, Joel.](edi/po-database-view.png)
:::

### Seller\'s process

Once the `PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
confirmed, it appears on the seller\'s portal dashboard. The seller
downloads the XML file and uploads it to their database.

#### Download file

As the seller, log in to the buyer\'s database as the portal user. On
the dashboard, scroll down and click the `Our Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. Doing so reveals a list of purchase orders the
buyer\'s database has addressed to the portal user.

Select the desired purchase order, and the click
`Connect with your software!`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

In the pop-up window, copy the provided URL, and paste it into a new
browser tab to download the XML file.

::: example
Joel\'s portal view of the PO. The first image displays the
`Connect with your
software!`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and the second
image displays a pop-up window with the `Copy`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.
:::

![Portal view of the PO, with \"Connect your software!\" button.](edi/po-portal-view.png)

![Pop-up to copy link.](edi/pop-up.png)

::: example
`XML file <edi/P00017.xml>`{.interpreted-text role="download"} for
PO00017
:::

#### Upload file {#purchase/advanced/rfq-upload}

Next, the seller logs in to their own Odoo database and opens
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app. Click
`Upload`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select the downloaded
XML file. Alternatively, users can drag and drop the file into the
`Quotations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

Doing so automatically generates a sales order with the customer
populated as the buyer and all product lines, quantities, and prices
pre-filled. This process ensures efficient and accurate data exchange
between the two databases.

# Procurement expenses report

With the *Purchase* application, users can monitor procurement expenses
over time. This report helps companies track and analyze spending,
identify cost-saving opportunities, and ensure efficient budget
management.

## Create procurement expenses report

To create a procurement expenses report, first navigate to
`Purchase app --> Reporting --> Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to open the `Purchase Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard.

By default, the dashboard displays a line chart overview of the
`Untaxed Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of
`Purchase Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (POs) with a
`Confirmation Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the current
month, or of Requests for Quotation (RFQs) with a status of *Draft*,
*Sent*, or *Cancelled*.

### Add filters and groups

On the top-right, click the `oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to switch
to pivot view.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

While the procurement expenses report can also be
`viewed <purchase/view-results>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} as a
`fa-bar-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(bar chart)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`fa-line-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(line chart)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`fa-pie-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(pie chart)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the pivot view
provides the most detailed view of the data, and is the recommended
starting point.
::::

Remove any default filters from the `Search...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} bar. Then, click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(down)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to open
the drop-down menu that contains the `Filters`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Unless otherwise specified, the report displays data from both
`RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
`POs (Purchase Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. This can be
changed by selecting either `Requests for Quotation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Purchase Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
under the `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.
::::

Under the `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, select a
time frame to use for comparison. The report can be filtered by either
`Order Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Confirmation Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Choose one from
the list, and click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(down)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to specify the date
range, either by month, quarter, or year.

Next, under the `Group by`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column,
select `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, select
`Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which is also
located in the `Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The selections under the `Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
heading can be altered, depending on the needs of the individual
company. For example, selecting `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, instead of `Product
Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, provides a more in depth
look at the performance of specific items, in place of an entire
category.
::::

Next, make a selection under the `Comparison`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} heading that appears. These options are only available
after the date range is selected under the `Filters`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column, and vary based on that range.
`Previous Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} adds a comparison
to the previous period, such as the last month or quarter.
`Previous Year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} compares the same
time period from the previous year.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

While multiple time-based filters can be added at once, only one
comparison can be selected at a time.

  `Untaxed Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: can include one or
  both measures. These are included for overall spending analysis.
- `Average Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: included to
  evaluate cost efficiency.
- `Days to Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Days to Receive`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: used to assess
  supplier performance.
- `Qty Ordered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Qty Received`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: used to understand

# Blanket orders

::: {#purchase/manage_deals/blanket-orders}
:::

Blanket orders are long-term purchase agreements between a company and a
vendor to deliver products on a recurring basis with predetermined
pricing.

Blanket orders are helpful when products are consistently purchased from
the same vendor, but in different quantities, and at different times.

By simplifying the ordering process, blanket orders not only save time,
they also save money, since they can be advantageous when negotiating
bulk pricing with vendors.

## Create a new blanket order

To create blanket orders, enable the *Purchase Agreements* feature from
the *Purchase* app settings. Navigate to
`Purchase app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and under the `Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, click the checkbox for
`Purchase Agreements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to implement the changes.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In addition to creating blanket orders, the *Purchase Agreements*
setting also allows users to create alternative requests for quotation
(RfQs).
::::

![Purchase Agreements enabled in the Purchase app settings.](blanket_orders/blanket-orders-enabled-setting.png)

To create a blanket order, go to
`Purchase app --> Orders --> Purchase Agreements`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. This opens a new purchase agreement form.

Configure the following fields in the new purchase agreement form to
establish predetermined rules for the recurring long-term agreement:

- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the supplier to whom this
  agreement is tied, either once or on a recurring basis. The vendor can
  be selected directly from the drop-down menu next to this field.
- `Buyer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the user assigned to this
  specific blanket order. By default, this is the user who created the
  agreement; the user can be changed directly from the drop-down menu
  next to this field.
- `Agreement Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the type of
  purchase agreement this blanket order is classified as. Use the
  drop-down menu to choose `Blanket Order`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} if not already selected.
- `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the agreed-upon
  currency to be used for this exchange. If multiple currencies have
  been activated in the database, the currency can be changed from the
  drop-down menu next to this field.
- `Agreement Validity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date
  range this agreement should be valid for. If this blanket order should
  not expire, leave this field blank.
- `Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the source purchase
  order (PO) that this blanket order is tied to. If this blanket order
  should not be tied to any existing
  `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, leave this field
  blank.
- `Operation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the operation
  type that should be applied to this order once it is delivered.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the company assigned to
  this specific blanket order. By default, this is the company that the
  user creating the blanket order is listed under. If the database is
  not a multi-company database, this field **cannot** be changed, and
  defaults to the only company listed in the database.

![New blanket order purchase agreement with added products.](blanket_orders/blanket-orders-new-agreement.png)

Once all relevant fields have been filled out, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add products under
the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. Then, in the
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, change the
quantity of each product, and set a price in the
`Unit Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When adding products to a new blanket order, the pre-existing prices of
products are not automatically added to the product lines. Instead, the
prices **must** be manually assigned, by changing the value in the
`Unit Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column to an agreed-upon
price with the listed vendor. Otherwise, the price will remain
[0]{.title-ref}.
::::

Click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save this new
purchase agreement.

Once confirmed, the blanket order\'s stage changes from
`Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Confirmed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, meaning this agreement
can be selected and used when creating new
`RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

After creating and confirming a blanket order, products, quantities, and
prices can still be edited, added, and removed from the purchase
agreement.
::::

## Create a new `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} from the blanket order {#create-a-new-rfq-from-the-blanket-order}

After confirming a blanket order, new quotations can be created directly
from the blanket order form.
`RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} using
this form are pre-populated with information based on the rules set in
the form. The total quantities of products ordered through linked
`RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are
automatically updated in the `Ordered`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field on the agreement.

Additionally, new quotations are automatically linked to this blanket
order form, via the `RFQs/Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
smart button at the top-right of the form.

To create a new quotation from the blanket order form, click the
`New Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. This opens a
new `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, that
is pre-populated with the correct information, depending on the settings
configured on the blanket order form.

From the new `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} form, click `Send by Email`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to compose and send an email to the listed vendor.
Click `Print RFQ`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to generate a
printable PDF of the quotation; or, once ready, click
`Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

![New quotation with copied products and rules from blanket order.](blanket_orders/blanket-orders-new-quotation.png)

Once the `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} has been
confirmed, click back to the blanket order form (via the breadcrumbs, at
the top of the page). From the blanket order form, there is now one
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} listed in
the `RFQs/Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the
top-right of the form. Click the `RFQs/Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button to see the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that was just
created.

![RFQs and Orders smart button from blanket order form.](blanket_orders/blanket-orders-rfq-smart-button.png)

## Replenishment

Once a blanket order is confirmed, a new vendor line is added under the
`Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the products
included in the order.

This makes blanket orders useful with `automated replenishment
<../../purchase/products/reordering>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"},
because information about the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Agreement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are referenced on the
vendor line. This information dictates when, where, and at what price
the product should be replenished.

similar goods or services all at once. This helps companies select the
cheapest, fastest vendors for their specific business needs.

In Odoo, this can be done by creating alternative requests for quotation
(RfQs) for different vendors. Once a response is received from each
vendor, the product lines from each
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can be
compared, and a decision can be made for which products to purchase from
which vendors.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Sometimes referred to as a *call for tender*, this process is primarily
used by organizations in the public sector, who are legally bound to use
it when making a purchase. However, private companies can also use
alternative `RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} to spend money efficiently.
::::

## Configuration

To create alternative `RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, the *Purchase Agreements* feature **must** be enabled in
the *Purchase* app settings. To enable the feature, navigate to
`Purchase app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Under the `Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, click the
checkbox for `Purchase Agreements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to apply the
change.

To create a new `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, follow the instructions in the `rfq`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation.

## Create alternative `RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} {#purchase/manage_deals/create-alternatives}

Once a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is created
and sent to a vendor, alternative
`RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can be
created for additional vendors to compare prices, delivery times, and
other factors, to help make a decision for the order.

To create alternative `RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} from the original, click the
`Alternatives`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Then, click
`Create Alternative`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. When clicked, a
`Create alternative`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears.

![Calls for tenders pop-up to create alternative quotation.](calls_for_tenders/calls-for-tenders-create-alternative.png){.align-center}

From this window, select an alternative vendor from the drop-down menu
next to the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, to whom
the alternative quotation is assigned.

Next to this, there is a `Copy Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox that is selected by default. When selected,
the product quantities of the original
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are copied
over to the alternative. For this first alternative quotation, leave the
checkbox checked. Once finished, click `Create
Alternative`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This opens a new
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form.

Since the `Create Alternative`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox was left checked, the new form is already pre-populated with
the same products, quantities, and other details as the previous,
original `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When the `Copy Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox is
selected while creating an alternative quotation, additional products do
**not** need to be added, unless desired.

However, if a chosen vendor is listed in the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column under a specific product form included in the
order, the values set on the product form carry over to the
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and
**must** be changed manually, if necessary.
::::

Once ready, create a second alternative quotation by clicking the
`Alternatives`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, followed by
`Create Alternative`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

This opens the `Create alternative`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window. Once again, choose a different vendor from the drop-down
menu next to `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. For this
particular `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
however, *uncheck* the `Copy Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox. Doing so removes all products on the new
alternative `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, leaving it blank. The specific products which should be
ordered from this particular vendor can be added in as needed.

Once ready, click `Create Alternative`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If an alternative quotation should be removed from the
`Alternatives`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, they can be
individually removed by clicking on the `X (remove)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon at the end of their row.
::::

This creates a third, new
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. But, since
the product quantities of the original
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} were
**not** copied over, the product lines are empty, and new products can
be added as needed by clicking `Add a product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and selecting the desired products from the drop-down
menu.

Once the desired number of specific products are added, click
`Send by Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Blank alternative quotation with alternatives in breadcrumbs.](calls_for_tenders/calls-for-tenders-blank-quotation.png){.align-center}

This opens a `Compose Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, wherein the message to the vendor can be customized, and
attachments can be added, if necessary. Once ready, click
`Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

From this newest form, click the `Alternatives`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. Under this tab, all three
`RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can be
seen in the `Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.
Additionally, the vendors are listed under the
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, and the order
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (and
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) of the orders are in the
rows, as well.

The date in the `Expected Arrival`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column is calculated for each vendor, based on any pre-configured lead
times in the vendor and product forms.

## Link new `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to existing quotations {#purchase/manage_deals/link-rfq}

Even if a quotation is not created directly from the
`Alternatives`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of another
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, it can
still be linked to existing
`RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

To do that, begin by creating a new
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Navigate
to `Purchase app --> New`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Fill
out the `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
according to the
`previous instructions <purchase/manage_deals/create-rfq>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Then, once ready, click the `Alternatives`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. Since this new
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} was created
separately, there are no other orders linked yet.

However, to link this `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} with existing alternatives, click
`Link to Existing RfQ`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the first
line in the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

![Pop-up to link new quotation to existing RFQs.](calls_for_tenders/calls-for-tenders-link-rfq-popup.png){.align-center}

This opens an `Add: Alternative POs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window. Select the desired previously-created
`RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and
click `Select`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. All of these orders
are now copied to this `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, and can be found under the
`Alternatives`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If a large number of `POs (Purchase Orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} are being processed, and the previous
`POs (Purchase Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can\'t be
located, click the `fa-chevron-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(chevron)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the right of the
search bar, at the top of the pop-up window.

Then, under the `Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
click `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Vendors are displayed
in their own nested drop-down lists, and each vendor\'s list can be
expanded to view open `POs (Purchase Orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} for that vendor.
::::

## Compare product lines {#purchase/manage_deals/compare-product-lines}

Alternative `RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} can be compared side-by-side, in order to determine which
vendors offer the best deals on the products included in the orders.

To compare alternative `RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, navigate to the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} app, and select one of the previously-created
`RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Then, click the `Alternatives`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to
see all linked `RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. Next, under the `Create Alternative`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option, click `Compare Product Lines`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. This navigates to the
`Compare Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.

![Compare Product Lines page for alternative RFQs.](calls_for_tenders/calls-for-tenders-compare-products.png){.align-center}

The `Compare Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, by
default, groups by `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Each
product included in any of the
`RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
displayed in its own nested drop-down list, and features all of the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} numbers in the
`Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To remove product lines from the `Compare Order Lines`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, click `Clear`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
at the far-right end of that product line\'s row.

Doing so removes this specific product as a selectable option from the
page, and changes the `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} price
of that product on the page to [0]{.title-ref}.

Additionally, on the `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} form, in which that product was included, its ordered
quantity is also changed to [0]{.title-ref}.
::::

Once the best offers have been identified, individual products can be
selected by clicking the `Choose`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button at the end of each corresponding row.

Once all desired products have been chosen, click
`Requests for Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (in the
breadcrumbs, at the top of the page) to navigate back to an overview of
all `RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

## Cancel (or keep) alternatives {#purchase/manage_deals/cancel-keep-alternatives}

Once the desired products have been chosen from the
`Compare Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, the
remaining `RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, from which no products were chosen, can be cancelled.

The cost in the `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column for
each product that wasn\'t chosen is automatically set to
[0]{.title-ref}, indicated at the far-right of each corresponding row.

Although they haven\'t been cancelled yet, this indicates that each of
those orders can be cancelled without having an effect on the other live
orders, once those orders have been confirmed.

![Cancelled quotations in the Purchase app overview.](calls_for_tenders/calls-for-tenders-zero-total.png){.align-center}

To confirm an `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} for which products were selected, click into an
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and click
`Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

This causes a
`What about the alternative Requests for Quotations?`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window to appear.

To view a detailed form of one of the
`RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} listed,
click the line item for that quotation. This opens an
`Open: Alternative POs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, from which all details of that particular
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can be
viewed.

Once ready, click `Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to close
the pop-up window.

In the
`What about the alternative Requests for Quotations?`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window, two options are presented:
`Cancel Alternatives`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Keep Alternatives`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If this `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} should
**not** be confirmed, click `Discard`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Selecting `Cancel Alternatives`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
automatically cancels the alternative
`RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
Selecting `Keep Alternatives`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} keeps
the alternative `RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} open, so they can still be accessed, if any additional
product quantities need to be ordered later.

Once all products are ordered, select
`Cancel Alternatives`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from whichever
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is open at that
time.

![Keep or cancel pop-up for alternative RFQs.](calls_for_tenders/calls-for-tenders-keep-or-cancel.png){.align-center}

Finally, using the breadcrumbs at the top of the page, click
`Requests for Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to navigate
back to an overview of all
`RfQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

The cancelled orders can be seen, greyed out and listed with a
`Cancelled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status, under the
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column at the far-right of
their respective rows.

Now that all product quantities have been ordered, the purchase process
can be completed, and the products can be received into the warehouse.

# Bill control policies

::: {#purchase/manage_deals/control-bills}
:::

In Odoo\'s *Purchase* app, the *bill control* policy determines the
quantities billed by vendors on every purchase order (PO), for either
ordered or received quantities.

The policy selected in the *Purchase* app settings acts as the default
value, and is applied to any new product created.

## Configuration

To configure the *bill control* policy, navigate to
`Purchase app --> Configuration
--> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and scroll down
to the `Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Under
`Bill Control`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select either
`Ordered quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Received quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Selected bill control policy in Purchase app settings.](control_bills/control-bills-selected-policy.png){.align-center}

- `Ordered quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: creates a
  vendor bill as soon as a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} is confirmed. The products and quantities in the
  `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are used to
  generate a draft bill.

- `Received quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a bill is
  created only *after* part of the total order has been received. The
  products and quantities received are used to generate a draft bill. An
  error message appears if creation of a vendor bill is attempted
  without receiving anything.

  ![Bill control policy draft bill error message.](control_bills/control-bills-error-message-popup.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If a specific product should use a different control policy than
selected in the *Purchase* app settings, the
`Bill Control`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} policy for that
product can be changed from its product form.

To do that, navigate to
`Purchase app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a product. From the product form,
click the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Under the
`Vendor
Bills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, modify the selection
in the `Control Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
::::

## 3-way matching

The *3-way matching* feature ensures vendor bills are only paid once
some (or all) of the products included in the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} have been received.

To activate *3-way matching*, navigate to
`Purchase app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and scroll down to
the `Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Then, tick
the checkbox for `3-way matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to

::::

### Pay vendor bills with 3-way matching

When *3-way matching* is enabled, vendor bills display a
`Should Be Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field under the
`Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. When a new vendor
bill is created, the field is set to `Yes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, since a bill **cannot** be created until at least some
of the products included in a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} have been received.

To create a vendor bill from a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, navigate to `Purchase app --> Orders -->
Purchase Orders`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. From the
`Purchase Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, select the
desired `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} from the
list. Then, click `Create Bill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Doing so opens a new draft `Vendor Bill`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} form, in the `Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
stage. Click the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
and locate the `Should Be
Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: important
::: title
Important

The `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} selected from
the list **must not** be billed yet, or an
`Invalid Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears. This occurs for `POs (Purchase Orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} with a `Received quantities`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} policy, and a `Fully Billed`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} `Billing Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Invalid Operation pop-up window for billed Purchase Order.](control_bills/control-bills-invalid-operation.png){.align-center}

Note
:::

If the total quantity of products from a
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} has not been
received, Odoo only includes the products that *have* been received in
the draft vendor bill.
::::

Draft vendor bills can be edited to increase the billed quantity, change
the price of the products in the bill, and add additional products to
the bill.

If the draft bill\'s information is changed, the
`Should Be Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field status is set
to `Exception`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This means that Odoo
notices the discrepancy, but does not block the changes or display an
error message, since there might be a valid reason for making changes to
the draft bill.

To process the vendor bill, select a date in the
`Bill Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and click
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, followed by
`Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

This opens a `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window. From this window, accounting information is pre-populated
based on the database\'s accounting settings. Click
`Create Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to process the
vendor bill.

Once payment has been registered for a vendor bill, and the bill
displays the green `Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner, the
`Should Be Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field status is set
to `No`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip

## View a purchase order\'s billing status

Once a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
confirmed, its `Billing Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can
be viewed under the `Other
Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form.

To view the `Billing Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of a
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, navigate to
`Purchase app -->

# Manage vendor bills

::: {#inventory/purchase/manage_deals/manage}
:::

A *vendor bill* is an invoice received for products and/or services
purchased by a company from a vendor. Vendor bills record payables as
they arrive from vendors, and can include amounts owed for the goods
and/or services purchased, sales taxes, freight and delivery charges,
and more.

In Odoo, a vendor bill can be created at different points in the
purchasing process, depending on the *bill control* policy chosen in the
*Purchase* app\'s settings.

## Bill control policies

To configure the default bill control policy, navigate to
`Purchase app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
scroll to the `Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

The `Bill Control`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature lists two
policy options: `Ordered quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Received quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The policy selected acts as the default for any new product created.
Each policy acts as follows:

- `Ordered quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: creates a
  vendor bill as soon as a purchase order is confirmed. The products and
  quantities in the purchase order are used to generate a draft bill.
- `Received quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a bill is
  only created **after** all (or part) of the total order has been
  received. The products and quantities received are used to generate a
  draft bill.

![Bill control policies in purchase app settings.](manage/manage-configuration-settings.png){.align-center}

Once a policy is selected, click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to save the changes.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If a product needs a different control policy than the one set in the
*Purchase* app settings, that product\'s control policy can be
overridden by going to the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab on a product form, and selecting the desired policy in the
`Control Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![Control policy field on product form.](manage/manage-product-form.png){.align-center}
::::

### 3-way matching

The *3-way matching* policy ensures vendor bills are only paid once all
(or some) products in a purchase order (PO) have been received.

To activate 3-way matching, navigate to
`Purchase app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and scroll to the
`Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

Tick the checkbox next to `3-way matching`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `3-way matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature is
**only** intended to work with the `Bill
Control`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} policy set to
`Received quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

## Create and manage vendor bills on receipts

When products are received into a company\'s warehouse, receipts are
created. Once the company processes the received quantities, they can
choose to create a vendor bill directly from the warehouse receipt form.

Depending on the bill control policy chosen in the settings, vendor bill
creation is completed at different steps of the procurement process.

### Ordered quantities

To create and manage vendor bills for receipts with the *Bill Control*
policy set to *Ordered Quantities*, first navigate to the
`Purchase app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
`Requests for Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

Doing so opens a new `Request for Quotation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} (RfQ) form. On the blank
`RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form, add a
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to add products to the
order.

On the product line, select a product from the drop-down menu in the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and enter the
quantity to order in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

Once ready, click `Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
confirm the `RfQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
into a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Then, click `Create Bill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a
vendor bill. This opens a `Vendor Bill`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} form in the `Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
state. From here, add a billing date in the
`Bill Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Once ready, confirm the bill by clicking `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the `Vendor Bill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
page.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Since the bill control policy is set to *Ordered quantities*, the draft
bill can be confirmed as soon as it is created, before any products have
been received.
::::

Once a payment has been received, click
`Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the
bill to record it.

Doing so causes a `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window to appear, wherein a payment `Journal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} can be chosen, and a `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} selected.

Additionally, the bill `Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Payment Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Memo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
(`Reference Number`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}) can be edited from
this pop-up window, if necessary.

## Manage vendor bills in Accounting

Vendor bills can also be created directly from the *Accounting* app,
without having to create a purchase order first.

Navigate to `Accounting app --> Vendors --> Bills`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Doing so reveals a blank
`Vendor Bill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form.

Add a vendor in the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
Then, in the `Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add products.

Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select a
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

There is also the option to `Group Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} together from this pop-up window, as well. If this
checkbox is ticked, only one payment is created, instead of one per
bill. This option only appears if the *Batch Payments* feature is
enabled in the settings of the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} app.

Once ready, click the `Create Payment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. This creates a list of journal entries on a
separate page. The journal entries on this list are all tied to their
corresponding vendor bills.

# Purchase templates

*Purchase templates* are an agreement type that allow for the repeated
creation of requests for quotations (RFQs) for recurring purchases.
Products can then be added and quantities can be changed, as needed.
Purchase templates can be used for multiple vendors, saving time and
simplifying the `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} process.

Purchase templates differ from *blanket orders* in that a
`blanket order <blanket_orders>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} is a
large order split into several deliveries, therefore all
`RFQs (requests for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} must be
for the same vendor. Purchase templates can be replicated for multiple
vendors, and can copy over quantities, which is useful when placing
frequent orders.

## Configuration

First, navigate to
`Purchase app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Under the `Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, tick the
`Purchase Agreements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox. Click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the changes.

![The Purchase agreements setting in the Purchase app.](purchase_templates/purchase-agreements-setting.png)

## Create a new template

Navigate
`Purchase app --> Orders --> Purchase Agreements`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Select a `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down
list.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To make this template available to use with multiple vendors, leave the
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field blank.
::::

In the `Agreement Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select
`Purchase Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
drop-down.

Confirm the information in the remaining fields is correct, or update as
needed.

On the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select the desired
product. Update the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
set the `Unit Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When adding products to a new blanket order, the pre-existing prices of
products are not automatically added to the product lines. Instead, the
prices **must** be manually assigned, by changing the value in the
`Unit Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column to an agreed-upon
price with the listed vendor. Otherwise, the price will remain
[0]{.title-ref}.
::::

After adding all necessary products, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

### Create a new RFQ from a purchase template

After confirming a purchase template, new quotations can be created
directly from the purchase template form.
`RFQs (requests for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} using
this form are pre-populated with information based on the rules set in
the form. Additionally, new quotations are automatically linked to this
purchase template form, via the `fa-list-alt`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `RFQs/Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button at the top of the form.

To
`create a new quotation <purchase/manage_deals/create-new-rfq>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, click `New
Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This opens a new
`RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, that is
pre-populated with the correct information, depending on the settings
configured on the purchase template form.

If there was no vendor identified on the purchase template, choose a
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down list.
Products can be added to the
`RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by clicking
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. To remove a product,
click the `fa-trash-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(trash)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon at the far-right of
the product line.

From the new `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} form, click `Send by Email`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to compose and send an email to the listed vendor.
Click `Print RFQ`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to generate a
printable PDF of the quotation; or, once ready, click
`Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the
purchase order.

After confirming the order, return to the purchase template via the
breadcrumbs. The `fa-list-alt`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`RFQs/Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button has been
updated to list the confirmed order.

# Requests for quotation

Odoo\'s requests for quotation (RFQs) feature in the **Purchase** app
standardizes ordering products from multiple vendors with varying prices
and delivery times.

`RFQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are
documents companies send to vendors requesting product pricing. In Odoo,
once the vendor approves the
`RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
purchase order (PO) is confirmed to align on lead times and pricing.

## Configuration

### Product

To auto-populate product information and prices on an
`RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, configure
products by going to
`Purchase app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select an existing product, or create a new one
by selecting `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so opens
the product form, where sales and purchasing data can be configured.

To configure purchasable products, tick the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox, under the product name. Next, go to the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and enable the
`Buy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} route.

:::: important

### Vendor pricelist {#purchase/manage_deals/vendor-pricelist}

In the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the product
form, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to input the
vendor and their price, to have this information auto-populate on an
`RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} each time
the product is listed.

::: seealso
`../products/pricelist`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

Default columns include `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Unit Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and `Delivery Lead
Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, but other columns like,
`Vendor Product Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Discount (%)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, can also be enabled.

To enable or disable columns, click the
`oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(additional options)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon on the
right side of the header row to reveal a drop-down menu of additional
columns that can be added (or removed) from the
`Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Alternatively, prices and delivery lead times for existing products can
be added by going to
`Purchase app --> Configuration --> Vendor Pricelists`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
the top-left corner. In the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section of the pricelist form that appears, add the product information
as it pertains to the vendor.
::::

## Order products

With products and prices configured, follow these steps to create and
send `RFQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
make purchases for the company.

### `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} dashboard {#rfq-dashboard}

To get started, navigate to
`Purchase app --> Orders --> Requests for Quotation`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

The `Requests for Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
dashboard displays an overview of the company\'s
`RFQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
`POs (Purchase Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and their
status. The top of the screen breaks down all
`RFQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in the
company, as well as individual ones (where the user is the buyer) with a
summary of their status.

The top-right corner also provides a report of the company\'s recent
purchases by total value, lead times, and number of
`RFQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} sent.

Additionally, the dashboard includes buttons for:

- `To Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: orders in the
  `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} stage
  that have not been sent to the vendor.
- `Waiting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `RFQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that
  have been sent by email, and are waiting on vendor confirmation.
- `Late`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `RFQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
  `POs (Purchase Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} where the
  `Order Deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} has passed.

![RFQ dashboard with orders and order statuses.](rfq/rfq-dashboard.png)

In addition to view options, the
`Requests for Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard
provides `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options, accessible via
the search bar drop-down menu.

### Create a new `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} {#purchase/manage_deals/create-new-rfq}

To create a new `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
on the top-left corner of the `Requests for Quotation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard to reveal a new
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form.

Start by assigning a `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The `Vendor Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field points
to the sales and delivery order numbers sent by the vendor. This comes
in handy once products are received, and the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} needs to be matched
to the delivery order.

With the
`Purchase Agreements feature <blanket_orders>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} activated, the `Blanket
Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears, referring to
long-term purchase agreements on recurring orders with set pricing. To
view and configure blanket orders, head to `Purchase app --> Orders -->
Purchase agreements`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Purchase agreements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view only
appears if the `Blanket Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
setting is enabled. To do so, navigate to
`Purchase app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then tick the `Blanket Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox.
::::

Next, configure an `Order Deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
which is the date by which the vendor must confirm their agreement to
supply the products.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

After the `Order Deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
exceeded, the `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is marked as late, but the products can still be ordered.
::::

`Expected Arrival`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is automatically
calculated based on the `Order Deadline`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and vendor lead time. Tick the checkbox for
`Ask confirmation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to ask the vendor
to confirm the shipping date by email.

With the `Storage Locations feature
<../../inventory/warehouses_storage/inventory_management/use_locations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} activated, the `Deliver to`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field appears, which specifies which warehouse
operation (set in the **Inventory** app) is used to receive the
shipment.

Select the receiving warehouse address here, or select
`Dropship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to indicate that this
order is to be shipped directly to the end customer. When
`Dropship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, the
`Dropship address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is enabled.
Contact names auto-populate here from the **Contacts** app.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Dropship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options only appear if
the `Dropshipping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting is enabled
in the **Inventory** app. To do so, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration
--> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, then tick the
`Dropshipping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

#### Products tab

In the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, add the
products to be ordered. Click `Add a product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and type in the product name, or select the item from
the drop-down menu.

To create a new product and add it, type the new product name in the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, select
`Create [product name]`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
resulting drop-down menu and manually add the unit price. Alternatively,
select `Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to be
taken to the product form for that new item.

`Catalog`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can also be selected to

### Send the `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} {#send-the-rfq}

Clicking `Send by Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} reveals a
`Compose Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, with a
`Purchase: Request for Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
template loaded, ready to send to the vendor\'s email address
(configured in the **Contacts** app).

After crafting the desired message, click `Send`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Once sent, the
`RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} moves to
the `RFQ Sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage.

Clicking `Print RFQ`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} downloads a PDF
of the `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

::: seealso
`../../../essentials/contacts`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}

### Confirm order {#purchase/manage_deals/confirm-order}

Clicking `Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} directly
transforms the `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} into an active `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Odoo tracks communications on each order through the chatter of the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form. This shows
the emails sent between the user and the contact, as well as any
internal notes and activities. Messages, notes, and activities can also
be logged on the chatter.
::::

Once an `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
confirmed, it creates a `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

On the new `PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
`Order Deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field changes to
`Confirmation Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which displays
the date and time the user confirmed the order.

Depending on the user\'s chosen configuration in the **Purchase** app
settings, a *vendor bill* is created once products have been ordered or
received. For more information, refer to the documentation on
`managing vendor bills <manage>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

# Import vendor pricelist

Set vendor prices to auto-populate requests for quotations (RFQs) or
purchase orders (POs) with the unit price, once the product is added,
which reduces errors and saves time.

In Odoo, vendor pricelists can be
`added individually <purchase/products/pricelist>`{.interpreted-text

#### External ID {#purchase/products/external-id}

*External ID* is a unique identifier used to update existing vendor
pricelists. Without it, imported records create new entries, instead of
updating existing ones. Including this field in the XLSX or CSV,
indicates the line replaces an existing vendor pricelist in the Odoo
database.

#### Formatting import file

To understand how to format import files for vendor pricelists, consider
the following example.

- [Storage Box]{.title-ref} (`Reference`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: [E-COM08]{.title-ref}) is sold by [Wood
  Corner]{.title-ref} for [\$10]{.title-ref}.
- [Large Desk]{.title-ref} (`Reference`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: [E-COM09]{.title-ref}) has no records in the vendor
  pricelist.

An import file is created to do the following:

- Update the price for [Wood Corner]{.title-ref} from [\$10]{.title-ref}
  to [\$13]{.title-ref}.
- Add pricelist for \`Storage Box\`: the vendor, [Ready Mat]{.title-ref}
  intends to sell the product for [\$14]{.title-ref}.
- Add pricelist for \`Large Desk\`: vendor is [Wood Corner]{.title-ref},
  price is [\$1299]{.title-ref}.
- Add pricelist for \`Large Desk\`: vendor is [Azure
  Interior]{.title-ref}, price is [\$1399]{.title-ref}.

# Configure reordering rules

For certain products, it is necessary to ensure that there is always a
minimum amount available on hand at any given time. Maintaining a
minimum stock level ensures that businesses can meet customer demand
without delays, and keep operations running smoothly. It also helps
buffer against supply chain disruptions and unexpected spikes in demand.
Inefficiencies may arise from inaccurate demand forecasting, supply
chain delays, and warehouse mismanagement, all of which can lead to
increased operational costs and wasted resources.

Keep highly demanded products in-stock at all times using reordering
rules, that trigger a RFQ (Request for Quotation) each time the
forecasted stock quantities fall below the minimum.
`RFQs (Requests for Quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} generated
from reordering rules have the vendor, price, quantity needed to
reorder, which makes things faster and more convenient.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The **Inventory** app must be installed to use reordering rules, as it
keeps track of stock quantity.
::::

## Configure products for reordering

Products must be configured in a specific way before a reordering rule
can be added to them.

Starting from the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
`Manufacturing`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
`Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, or
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, navigate to
`Products -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and then click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to make a new product.
Alternatively, find a product that already exists in the database and
click into it\'s product form.

Next, on the product form, enable reordering by ticking the
`Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox underneath the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} name field. Then, under the
`General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, set the
`Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Goods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Finally, tick the checkbox
labeled `Track Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select
an `option
<../../inventory/product_management/product_tracking>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} from the drop-down.

![Configure a product for reordering in Odoo.](reordering/product-configured-for-reordering.png)

## Add a reordering rule to a product

After properly configuring a product, a reordering rule can be added to
it by selecting the now visible `fa-refresh`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Reordering Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button at the top of that product\'s form, then clicking
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
`Reordering Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If the `fa-refresh`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Reordering Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button is
not visible, click `More`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

Once created, the reordering rule can be configured to generate purchase
orders automatically by defining the following fields:

- `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} specifies where the
  ordered quantities should be stored once they are received and entered
  into stock.

- `Min Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sets the lower
  threshold for the reordering rule while `Max
  Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sets the upper threshold.
  If the stock on hand falls below the minimum quantity, a new purchase
  order is then created to replenish it up to the maximum quantity.

  > ::: example
  > If `Min Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
  > [5]{.title-ref} and `Max Quantity`{.interpreted-text
  > role="guilabel"} is set to [25]{.title-ref} and the stock on hand
  > falls to four, a purchase order is then created for 21 units of the
  > product.
  > :::

- `Multiple Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be
  configured so that products are only ordered in batches of a certain
  quantity. Depending on the number entered, this can result in the
  creation of a purchase order that would put the resulting stock on
  hand above what is specified in the `Max
  Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

  > ::: example
  > If `Max Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
  > [100]{.title-ref} but `Multiple Quantity`{.interpreted-text
  > role="guilabel"} is set to order the product in batches of
  > [200]{.title-ref}, a purchase order is then created for 200 units of
  > the product.
  > :::

- `Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} specifies the unit of
  measurement by which the quantity is to be ordered. For discrete
  products, this should be set to [Units]{.title-ref}. However, it can
  also be set to units of measurement like [Volume]{.title-ref} or
  [Weight]{.title-ref} for non-discrete products like water or bricks.

## Manually trigger reordering rules using the scheduler

Reordering rules are automatically triggered by the scheduler, which
runs once a day by default. To trigger reordering rules manually, turn
on developer mode, navigate to `Inventory app
--> Operations --> Procurement: Run Scheduler`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. On the pop-up window, confirm the manual action
by clicking `Run Scheduler`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To manage the reordering rules for a single product, navigate to that
product page\'s form and select the `Reordering Rules`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button at the top of the form.

To manage all reordering rules for every product, go to
`Inventory app --> Operations
--> Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. From this
dashboard, typical bulk actions in Odoo can be performed such as
exporting data or archiving rules that are no longer needed. As well,
the `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or triple-dotted menu on
the form are available to search for and/or organize the reordering
rules as desired.

# Temporary reordering rules

Some businesses require certain products to always have a minimum
quantity of stock on-hand at any given time. To avoid stock falling
below a certain threshold, companies can create *reordering rules* in
Odoo to automate purchase orders for specific products.

Reordering rules keep the forecasted stock levels above a certain
threshold, without exceeding a specified upper limit, or maximum amount.
When a product with a reordering rule falls below a specified quantity,
Odoo generates an order using the specified *route* (e.g. *Buy* or
*Manufacture*) to replenish the stock.

In certain cases, businesses might opt for *temporary reordering rules*
when they do not want specific products to be replenished automatically.

In Odoo, a \"temporary\" reordering rule is created in the replenishment
dashboard when a product:

1.  is configured with a *Buy* route
2.  has no reordering rule configured
3.  has [0]{.title-ref} quantity in stock
4.  is included in a sales order (SO).

This rule is deleted upon confirmation of the purchase order (PO)
generated for the product.

## Configuration

To configure a product that triggers temporary reordering rules when its
stock reaches [0]{.title-ref}, begin by going to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The same configurations can also be made on an existing product, by
going to `Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and selecting an existing product.
::::

On the product form, enter the product name, and ensure the
`Can be Sold`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Can be Purchased`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options are
enabled, located beneath the `Product Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

Then, set the `Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
[Storable Product]{.title-ref}, under the `General
Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

Next, click the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and
under `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to select a vendor from
the drop-down menu. Then, set a purchase price under
`Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

A vendor **must** be set for temporary reordering rules to work. While a
`PO (purchase
order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can still be created
automatically, attempting to replenish the product from the
`Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard in the
*Inventory* app triggers a warning to add a vendor on the product form.

![Warning pop-up upon clicking to replenish product with no set vendor.](temporary_reordering/temporary-reordering-warning-popup.png){.align-center}
::::

Before creating a `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for
the product, ensure the `On Hand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
smart button on the product form reads [0.00 Units]{.title-ref}. Then,
ensure that the `Reordering Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
smart button reads [0]{.title-ref}, indicating there are no rules
applied to this product.

![Product form smart button row displaying reordering rules and on hand buttons.](temporary_reordering/temporary-reordering-smart-buttons.png){.align-center}

## Trigger temporary reordering rule

To trigger a temporary reordering rule, create a new sales order for a
product by navigating to `Sales app --> New`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Then, add a customer in the `Customer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, and click `Add a product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} under the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column in the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
Next, select the desired product from the drop-down menu. Lastly,
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

![Sales order for product with no set reordering rules.](temporary_reordering/temporary-reordering-sales-order.png){.align-center}

## Check replenishment report {#purchase/check-replenishment}

To see the temporary reordering rule created for the out-of-stock
product included in the sales order, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Operations --> Replenishment`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Doing so opens the
`Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

On this dashboard, locate the product for which the temporary reordering
rule was created. On its product line, its `On Hand`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} quantity, negative `Forecast`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} quantity, *Buy* `Route`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `To Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
quantity to replenish can be seen.

Additionally, two replenishment options are located to the far-right of
the row: `Order
Once`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Automate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Replenishment report displaying temporary reordering rule and options.](temporary_reordering/temporary-reordering-replenishment-dashboard.png){.align-center}

To use the one-time, temporary reordering rule, click
`Order Once`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This action triggers a
confirmation pop-up window in the top-right corner, reading
`The following replenishment
order has been generated`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, along with
a new purchase order number.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Once the purchase order has been generated after clicking
`Order Once`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, refresh the page. The
temporary reordering rule for the product no longer appears in the
`Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.
::::

## Complete purchase order

To view the purchase order created from the
`Replenishment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, navigate
to the `Purchase app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
select the generated `PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} from the `Requests for Quotation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} overview.

From here, click `Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
then click `Receive Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Finally, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to complete
the purchase order.

![Purchase order for product ordered with temporary reordering rule.](temporary_reordering/temporary-reordering-purchase-order.png){.align-center}

Now, the original sales order can be delivered and invoiced.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Once the `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is delivered
and invoiced, ensure there are no reordering rules on the product form.

Go to `Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select the product, and confirm that the
`Reordering Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button
displays [0]{.title-ref}.

# Instructions quality check

In Odoo *Quality*, an *Instructions* check is one of the quality check
types that can be selected when creating a new quality check or quality
control point (QCP). *Instructions* checks consist of a text entry field
that allows the creator to provide instructions for how to complete the
check.

For a full overview of how to configure a quality check or a
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, see the
documentation on
`quality checks <quality/quality_management/quality-checks>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `quality control points
<quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

## Process an Instructions quality check

There are multiple ways that *Instructions* quality checks can be
processed. If a quality check is assigned to a specific manufacturing,
inventory, or work order, the check can be processed on the order
itself. Alternatively, a check can be processed from the check\'s page.

### Process from the quality check\'s page

To process an *Instructions* quality check from the check\'s page, begin
by navigating to
`Quality --> Quality Control --> Quality Checks`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a quality check. Follow the
`Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for how to complete
the check.

If the product passes the check, click the `Pass`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button above the quality check form. If the product
does not pass the check, click the `Fail`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, instead.

### Process quality check on an order

To process an *Instructions* quality check on an order, select a
manufacturing order or inventory order (receipt, delivery, return, etc.)
for which a check is required. Manufacturing orders can be selected by
navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and clicking on an order. Inventory orders can be
selected by navigating to `Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, clicking the `# To Process`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on an operation card, and selecting an order.

On the selected manufacturing or inventory order, a purple
`Quality Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button appears above
the order. Click the button to open the
`Quality Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, from
which any quality checks created for the order can be processed.

![The Quality Check pop-up window on a manufacturing or inventory order.](instructions_check/quality-check-pop-up.png){.align-center}

To complete an *Instructions* quality check, follow the instructions
detailed in the `Quality Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window. Finally, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to confirm that the check has been completed.

If an issue or defect is found during the quality check, a quality alert
may need to be created to notify a quality team. To do so, click the
`Quality Alert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button that appears
at the top of the manufacturing or inventory order after the check is
validated.

Clicking `Quality Alert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} opens a
quality alert form on a new page. For a complete guide on how to fill
out quality alert forms, view the documentation on `quality alerts
<quality/quality_management/quality-alerts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### Process work order quality check

When configuring a `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} that is triggered by a manufacturing order, a specific work
order can also be specified in the
`Work Order Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form. If a
work order is specified, an *Instructions* quality check is created for
that specific work order, rather than the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} as a whole.

Quality checks configured for work orders **must** be completed from the
*Shop Floor* module. To do so, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that includes
a work order for which an *Instructions* quality check is required.

On the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, select
the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and click the
`Open Work Order
(square with arrow coming out of it)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button on the line of the work order to be processed. On the resulting
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, click
the `Open Shop Floor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to open
the *Shop Floor* module.

When accessed from a specific work order, the *Shop Floor* module opens
to the page for the work center where the order is configured to be
processed, and isolates the work order\'s card so that no other cards
are shown.

Begin processing the work order\'s steps until the *Instructions*
quality check step is reached. Click on the step to open a pop-up window
that details how to complete the quality check. Once completed, click
the `Next`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to complete the
check, and move on to the next step.

![An Instruction check as it appears in the Shop Floor module.](instructions_check/instructions-check-shop-floor.png){.align-center}

Alternatively, an *Instructions* quality check can be completed by
clicking the checkbox that appears on the right side of the step\'s line
on the work order card. When using this method, the quality check
automatically passes, without a pop-up window appearing.

# Measure quality check

In Odoo *Quality*, a *Measure* check is one of the quality check types
that can be selected when creating a new quality check or quality
control point (QCP). *Measure* checks prompt users to measure a certain
aspect of a product and record the measurement in Odoo. For the quality
check to pass, the recorded measurement must be within a certain
*tolerance* of a *norm* value.

## Create a Measure quality check

There are two distinct ways that *Measure* quality checks can be
created. A single check can be manually created. Alternatively, a
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can be
configured that automatically creates checks at a predetermined
interval.

This documentation only details the configuration options that are
unique to *Measure* quality checks and
`QCPs (Quality Control Points)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. For a
full overview of all the configuration options available when creating a
single check or a `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, see the documentation on `quality checks
<quality/quality_management/quality-checks>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `quality control points
<quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### Quality check

To create a single *Measure* quality check, navigate to
`Quality --> Quality Control
--> Quality Checks`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Fill out the new quality check
form as follows:

- In the `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field,
  select the `Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} quality check
  type.
- In the `Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field,
  select the quality team responsible for managing the check.
- In the `Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} text field of
  the `Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, enter instructions
  for how the picture should be taken.

![A quality check form configured for a Measure quality check.](measure_check/measure-check-form-1.png){.align-center}

### Quality control point (QCP)

To create a `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
that generates *Measure* quality checks automatically, navigate to
`Quality --> Quality Control --> Control Points`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Fill out the new
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form as
follows:

- In the `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field,
  select the `Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} quality check
  type. Doing so causes two new fields to appear:
  `Norm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Tolerance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  - Use the first text-entry field of the `Norm`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field to record the ideal measurement that the
    product should conform to. Use the second text-entry field to
    specify the unit of measurement that should be used.
  - The `Tolerance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field features
    two sub-fields: `from`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
    `to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Use the
    `from`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to specify the
    minimum acceptable measurement, and the `to`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field to specify the maximum acceptable
    measurement.
- In the `Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field,
  select the quality team responsible for managing the checks created by
  the `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
- In the `Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} text field,
  enter instructions for how the measurement should be taken.

![A QCP form configured to create Measure quality checks.](measure_check/measure-check-qcp-form.png){.align-center}

## Process a Measure quality check

Once created, there are multiple ways that *Measure* quality checks can
be processed. If a quality check is assigned to a specific inventory,
manufacturing, or work order, the check can be processed on the order
itself. Alternatively, a check can be processed from the check\'s page.

### From the check\'s page

To process a *Measure* quality check from the check\'s page, begin by
navigating to
`Quality --> Quality Control --> Quality Checks`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a quality check. Follow the
`Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for how to take the
measurement.

After taking the measurement, record the value in the
`Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the quality check
form. To manually pass or fail the check, click `Pass`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Fail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the
top-left corner of the check.

Alternatively, if the quality check is assigned to a
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for which
*norm* and *tolerance* values have been specified, click
`Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top-left corner of
the check instead. Doing so automatically marks the check as *Passed* if
the recorded value is within the specified *tolerance*, or *Failed* if
the value is outside of it.

### On an order

To process a *Measure* quality check on an order, select a manufacturing
order or inventory order (receipt, delivery, return, etc.), for which a
check is required. Manufacturing orders can be selected by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and clicking on an order. Inventory orders can be
selected by navigating to `Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, clicking the `# To Process`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on an operation card, and selecting an order.

On the selected manufacturing or inventory order, a purple
`Quality Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button appears at
the top of the page. Click the button to open the
`Quality Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, which
shows all of the quality checks required for that order.

To process a *Measure* quality check, measure the product as instructed,
then enter the value in the `Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field on the pop-up window. Finally, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to register the recorded value.

![A Measure quality check pop-up window on a manufacturing or inventory order.](measure_check/measure-check-pop-up.png){.align-center}

If the value entered is within the range specified in the
`Tolerance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
quality check passes and the pop-up window closes. The rest of the
manufacturing or inventory order can then be processed as usual.

However, if the value entered is outside of the specified range, a new
pop-up window appears, titled `Quality Check Failed`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The body of the pop-up shows a warning message that
states,
`You measured # units and it should be between # units and # units.`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, as well as the instructions entered in the
`Message If Failure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. At the
bottom of the pop-up, two buttons appear:
`Correct Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Confirm Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The \"Quality Check Failed\" pop-up window.](measure_check/measure-check-failed.png){.align-center}

If the measurement was not entered correctly and should be changed,
select `Correct
Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so re-opens the
`Quality Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window. Enter
the corrected measurement in the `Measure`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, and then click `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to complete the check.

If the measurement was entered correctly, click
`Confirm Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} instead, and the
quality check fails. Follow any instructions that were listed on the
`Quality Check Failed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

If a quality alert must be created, click the
`Quality Alert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button that appears
at the top of the manufacturing or inventory order after the check
fails. Clicking `Quality
Alert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} opens a quality alert form on
a new page.

::: seealso
For a complete guide on how to fill out the quality alert form, view the
documentation on
`quality alerts <../quality_management/quality_alerts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
:::

### On a work order

When configuring a `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} that is triggered during manufacturing, a specific work
order can also be specified in the
`Work Order Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form. If a
work order is specified, a *Measure* quality check is created for that
specific work order, rather than the manufacturing order as a whole.

*Measure* quality checks configured for work orders **must** be
completed from the *Shop Floor* module. To do so, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations -->
Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Select an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that includes
a work order for which a *Measure* quality check is required.

On the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, select
the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and click the
`Open Work Order
(external link icon)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
line of the work order to be processed. On the resulting
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, click
the `Open Shop Floor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to open
the *Shop Floor* module.

When accessed from a specific work order, the *Shop Floor* module opens
to the page for the work center where the order is configured to be
processed, and isolates the work order\'s card, so no other cards are
shown.

Process the work order\'s steps until the *Measure* quality check step
is reached. Click on the step to open a pop-up window that includes
instructions for how the measurement should be taken. After taking the
measurement, enter it in the `Measure`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field of the pop-up window, and then click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![A Measure check in the Shop Floor module.](measure_check/measure-check-shop-floor.png){.align-center}

If the measurement entered is within the range specified in the
`Tolerance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
quality check passes, and the pop-up window moves on to the next step of
the work order. However, if the measurement entered is outside of the
specified range, a new pop-up window appears, titled
`Quality Check Failed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The body of the `Quality Check Failed`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window shows a message that states,
`You measured # units and it should be between # units and # units`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, as well as the instructions entered in the
`Message If Failure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. At the
bottom of the pop-up window, two buttons appear:
`Correct Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Confirm Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Quality Check Failed pop-up window for a Measure check in the Shop Floor module.](measure_check/shop-floor-measure-check-failed.png){.align-center}

If the measurement was not entered correctly, and should be changed,
select `Correct
Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so opens a new pop-up
window, titled `Quality Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Enter
the corrected measure in the `Measure`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, and then click `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to complete the check and close the pop-up window.

If the measurement was entered correctly, click
`Confirm Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} instead, and the
quality check fails. Follow any instructions that were listed on the
`Quality Check Failed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

If a quality alert must be created, exit the pop-up window by clicking
the `X (close)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
top-right corner.

Then, click the `⋮ (three vertical dots)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the bottom-right corner of the work order
card to open the `What do you want to do?`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

On the `What do you want to do?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window, select the `Create a Quality
Alert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. Doing so opens a blank
quality alert form in a new `Quality Alerts`{.interpreted-text

# Pass - Fail quality check

In Odoo *Quality*, a *Pass - Fail* check is one of the quality check
types that can be selected when creating a new quality check or quality
control point (QCP). *Pass - Fail* checks consist of a text field that
allows the creator to specify a certain criteria that a product must
meet to pass the check.

## Create a Pass - Fail quality check

There are two distinct ways that *Pass - Fail* quality checks can be
created. A single check can be manually created. Alternatively, a
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can be
configured that automatically creates checks at a predetermined
interval.

This documentation only details the configuration options that are
unique to *Pass - Fail* quality checks and
`QCP (Quality Control Points)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. For a
full overview of all the configuration options available when creating a
single check or a `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, see the documentation on `quality checks
<quality/quality_management/quality-checks>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `quality control points
<quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### Quality check

To create a single *Pass - Fail* quality check, navigate to
`Quality --> Quality
Control --> Quality Checks`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Fill out the new quality
check form as follows:

- In the `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field,
  select the `Pass - Fail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} quality
  check type.
- In the `Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field,
  select the quality team responsible for managing the check.
- In the `Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} text field of
  the `Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, enter instructions
  for how to complete the quality check and the criteria that must be
  met for the check to pass.

![A quality check form configured for a Pass - Fail quality check.](pass_fail_check/quality-check-form.png){.align-center}

### Quality Control Point (QCP)

To create a `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
that generates *Pass - Fail* quality checks automatically, begin by
navigating to
`Quality --> Quality Control --> Control Points`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Fill out the new
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form as
follows:

- In the `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field,
  select the `Pass - Fail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} quality
  check type.
- In the `Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field,
  select the quality team responsible for managing the checks created by
  the `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
- In the `Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} text field,

  criteria that must be met for the check to pass.

![A Quality Control Point (QCP) form configured to create a Pass - Fail quality check.](pass_fail_check/qcp-form.png){.align-center}

## Process a Pass - Fail quality check

Once created, there are multiple ways that *Measure* quality checks can
be processed. If a quality check is assigned to a specific inventory,
manufacturing, or work order, the check can be processed on the order
itself. Alternatively, a check can be processed from the check\'s page.

### From the check\'s page

To process a *Measure* quality check from the check\'s page, begin by
navigating to
`Quality --> Quality Control --> Quality Checks`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a quality check. Follow the
`Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for how to complete
the check.

If the criteria for the check is met, click the `Pass`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button at the top-left corner of the page. If the
criteria is not met, click the `Fail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button.

### On an order

To process a *Pass - Fail* quality check on an order, select a
manufacturing order or inventory order (receipt, delivery, return,
etc.), for which a check is required. Manufacturing orders can be
selected by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and clicking on an order. Inventory orders can be
selected by navigating to `Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, clicking the `# To Process`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on an operation card, and selecting an order.

On the selected manufacturing or inventory order, a purple
`Quality Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button appears at
the top of the order. Click the button to open the
`Quality Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, which
shows all of the quality checks required for that order.

To process a *Pass - Fail* quality check, follow the instructions shown
on the `Quality
Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window. If the criteria
for the check is met, click the `Pass`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button at the bottom of the window. If the criteria is
not met, click the `Fail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![A Pass - Fail quality check pop-up window on a manufacturing or inventory order.](pass_fail_check/pass-fail-check-pop-up.png){.align-center}

If a quality alert must be created, click the
`Quality Alert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button that appears
at the top of the manufacturing or inventory order after the check
fails. Clicking `Quality
Alert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} opens a quality alert form on
a new page.

:::

### On a work order

When configuring a `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} that is triggered during manufacturing, a specific work
order can also be specified in the
`Work Order Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form. If a
work order is specified, a *Pass - Fail* quality check is created for
that specific work order, rather than the manufacturing order as a
whole.

*Pass - Fail* quality checks configured for work orders **must** be
completed from the *Shop Floor* module. To do so, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations -->
Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Select an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that includes
a work order for which a *Pass - Fail* quality check is required.

On the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, select
the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and then click
the `Open Work Order
(external link icon)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
line of the work order to be processed. On the resulting
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, click
the `Open Shop Floor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to open
the *Shop Floor* module.

When accessed from a specific work order, the *Shop Floor* module opens
to the page for the work center where the order is configured to be
processed, and isolates the work order\'s card so that no other cards
are shown.

Begin processing the work order\'s steps until the *Pass - Fail* quality
check step is reached. Click on the step to open a pop-up window that
details the criteria for whether the check passes or fails. Click the
`Pass`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the bottom of the
pop-up window if the check passes, or the `Fail`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button if it fails.

If the `Pass`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is clicked, the
pop-up window moves to the next step for the work order. If the
`Fail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is clicked, a
`Quality Check Failed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears, detailing what should be done next.

![A Pass - Fail check as it appears in the Shop Floor module.](pass_fail_check/pass-fail-check-shop-floor.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Alternatively, instead of clicking on the step to open the pop-up
window, a *Pass - Fail* quality check can be completed by clicking the
checkbox that appears on the right side of the step\'s line on the work
order card. When using this method, the quality check passes
automatically, without a pop-up window appearing.

# Take a Picture quality check

In Odoo *Quality*, a *Take a Picture* check is one of the quality check
types that can be selected when creating a new quality check or quality
control point (QCP). *Take a Picture* checks require a picture to be
attached to the check, which can then be reviewed by a quality team.

## Create a Take a Picture quality check

There are two distinct ways that *Take a Picture* quality checks can be
created. A single check can be manually created. Alternatively, a
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can be
configured that automatically creates checks at a predetermined
interval.

This documentation only details the configuration options that are
unique to *Take a Picture* quality checks and
`QCP (Quality Control Points)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. For a
full overview of all the configuration options available when creating a
single check or a `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, see the documentation on `quality checks
<quality/quality_management/quality-checks>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `quality control points
<quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### Quality check

To create a single *Take a Picture* quality check, navigate to
`Quality --> Quality
Control --> Quality Checks`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Fill out the new quality
check form as follows:

- In the `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field,
  select the `Take a Picture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} quality
  check type.
- In the `Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field,
  select the quality team responsible for managing the check.
- In the `Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} text field of
  the `Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, enter instructions
  for how the picture should be taken.

![A quality check form configured for a Take a Picture quality check.](picture_check/picture-check-form.png){.align-center}

### Quality control point

To create a `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
that generates *Take a Picture* quality checks automatically, navigate
to `Quality --> Quality Control --> Control Points`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Fill out the new
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form as
follows:

- In the `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field,
  select the `Take a Picture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} quality
  check type.
- If the *Maintenance* app is installed, a `Device`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field appears after selecting the *Take a Picture*
  check type. Use this field to specify a device that should be used to
  take quality check pictures. For information about managing devices in
  the *Maintenance* app, see the documentation on
  `adding new equipment <maintenance/equipment_management/add_new_equipment>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- In the `Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field,
  select the quality team responsible for managing the checks created by
  the `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
- In the `Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} text field,
  enter instructions for how the picture should be taken.

![A Quality Control Point (QCP) form configured to create a Take a Picture quality check.](picture_check/picture-qcp-form.png){.align-center}

## Process a Take a Picture quality check

Once created, there are multiple ways that *Take a Picture* quality
checks can be processed. If a quality check is assigned to a specific
inventory, manufacturing, or work order, the check can be processed on
the order itself. Alternatively, a check can be processed from the
check\'s page.

### From the check\'s page

To process a *Take a Picture* quality check from the check\'s page,
begin by navigating to
`Quality --> Quality Control --> Quality Checks`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and then select a quality check. Follow the
`Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for how to take the
picture.

After taking the picture, make sure it is stored on the device being
used to process the quality check (computer, tablet, etc.). Then, click
the `✏️ (pencil)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
`Picture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section to open the
device\'s file manager. In the file manager, navigate to the picture,
select it, and click `Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to attach
it.

![The edit button (pencil) on a Take a Picture quality check.](picture_check/picture-edit-button.png){.align-center}

### On an order

To process a *Take a Picture* quality check on an order, select a
manufacturing order or inventory order (receipt, delivery, return,
etc.), for which a check is required. Manufacturing orders can be
selected by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and clicking on an order. Inventory orders can be
selected by navigating to `Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, clicking the `# To Process`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on an operation card, and selecting an order.

On the selected manufacturing or inventory order, a purple
`Quality Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button appears at
the top of the page. Click the button to open the
`Quality Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, which
shows all of the quality checks required for that order.

Follow the instructions detailing how to take the picture, which are
shown on the `Quality
Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window. After taking
the picture, make sure it is stored on the device being used to process
the quality check (computer, tablet, etc.).

Then, click the `Take a Picture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button in the `Picture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section to
open the device\'s file manager. In the file manager, navigate to the
picture, select it, and click `Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to attach it. Finally, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the `Quality Check`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window to complete the quality check.

![A Take a Picture quality check pop-up window on a manufacturing or inventory order.](picture_check/picture-check-pop-up.png){.align-center}

If a quality alert must be created, click the
`Quality Alert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button that appears
at the top of the manufacturing or inventory order after the check is
validated. Clicking `Quality Alert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
opens a quality alert form on a new page. For a complete guide on how to
fill out quality alert forms, view the documentation on `quality alerts
<quality/quality_management/quality-alerts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### On a work order

When configuring a `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} that is triggered during manufacturing, a specific work
order can also be specified in the
`Work Order Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form. If a
work order is specified, a *Take a Picture* quality check is created for
that specific work order, rather than the manufacturing order as a
whole.

*Take a Picture* quality checks configured for work orders **must** be
completed from the *Shop Floor* module. To do so, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations -->
Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Then,
select an `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that
includes a work order for which a *Take a Picture* quality check is
required.

On the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, select
the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and then click
the `Open Work Order
(external link icon)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
line of the work order to be processed. On the resulting
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, click
the `Open Shop Floor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to open
the *Shop Floor* module.

When accessed from a specific work order, the *Shop Floor* module opens
to the page for the work center where the order is configured to be
processed, and isolates the work order\'s card, so no other cards are
shown.

Process the work order\'s steps until the *Take a Picture* quality check
step is reached. Click on the step to open a pop-up window that includes
instructions for how the picture should be taken. After taking the
picture, make sure it is stored on the device being used to process the
quality check (computer, tablet, etc.).

Then, click the `Take a Picture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button on the pop-up window to open the device\'s file manager. In the
file manager, navigate to the picture, select it, and click
`Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to attach it.

Finally, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the
bottom of the pop-up window to complete the quality check. The pop-up
window then moves on to the next step of the work order.

![A Take a Picture check in the Shop Floor module.](picture_check/picture-check-shop-floor.png){.align-center}

If a quality alert must be created, exit the pop-up window by clicking
the `X (close)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
top-right corner.

Then, click the `⋮ (three vertical dots)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the bottom-right corner of the work order
card to open the `What do you want to do?`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

On the `What do you want to do?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window, select the `Create a Quality
Alert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. Doing so opens a blank
quality alert form in a new `Quality Alerts`{.interpreted-text

# Failure locations

In Odoo, *quality control points* (QCPs) are used to create *quality
checks*, which prompt employees to confirm the quality of products, when
they are included in certain operations. By setting one or more *failure
locations* on a `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, products that fail the quality checks it creates can be
sent to one of the specified locations.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The *Failure Location* feature was added in version 17.0 of Odoo, and
does **not** appear in any previous version. To upgrade an Odoo database
to a more recent version, see the documentation on
`database upgrades <../../../../administration/upgrade>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
::::

## Configuration

To use failure locations, the *Storage Locations* setting **must** be
enabled in the settings of the *Inventory* app. This setting allows for
the creation of sub-locations within a warehouse, including failure
locations.

To enable the *Storage Locations* setting, navigate to
`Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
tick the checkbox next to `Storage Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, under the `Warehouses`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} heading. Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![The Storage Locations setting on the Inventory app settings page.](failure_locations/storage-locations-setting.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Failure locations are most effective when used for products configured
as *storable products*. This is because inventory counts are only
tracked for storable products, versus *consumable* products, for which
exact counts are not tracked.

Quality checks can still be created for consumable products, and those
products can be sent to a failure location if they fail a check.
However, Odoo does not track the exact quantity of a consumable product
stored at a failure location.

To configure a product as storable, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Products -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select a product.
In the `Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the
`General
Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, make sure that
`Storable Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected from
the drop-down menu.
::::

## Add failure location to QCP

To add a failure location to a
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, navigate
to `Quality app --> Quality Control
--> Control Points`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Select an
existing `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
from the list, or create a new one by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The following instructions only detail the configuration settings
necessary for adding a failure location to a
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. For a full
overview of `QCP (Quality Control Points)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and all of the options available when configuring them, see
the documentation on `quality control points
<quality_control_points>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
::::

In the `Control Per`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form,
select the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. Doing
so causes a `Failure Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
to appear on the form. This field is only available when the
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is selected.

In the `Failure Locations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
select one or more locations from the drop-down menu. To create a new
location, type the desired location name into the field, and then select
`Create "[name]"`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down
menu.

![A QCP form in the Quality app, configured with a failure location.](failure_locations/qcp-form.png){.align-center}

## Send products to failure location

Once a `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} has
been configured with one or more failure locations, products that fail a
check created by the `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} can be routed to one of the locations.

To do so, open an order that requires a quality check created by a
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} configured
with a failure location. For example, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Operations --> Receipts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a receipt.

At the top of the selected order, click the
`Quality Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to open a
pop-up window, from which the quality check can be processed. At the
bottom of the pop-up window, click the `Fail`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to fail the quality check, which opens a second
pop-up window, titled
`Quality Check Failed for [Product]`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In the `Quantity Failed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, enter
the quantity of the product that failed to pass the quality check. In
the `Failure Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select
a location to which the failed quantity should be sent. Then, click
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the bottom of the pop-up
window to close it.

![The pop-up window that appears after a quality check fails.](failure_locations/failed-pop-up.png){.align-center}

Finally, on the order, click the `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button at the top of the page. Doing so confirms the
products that failed the quality check were sent to the failure
location, while products that passed it were sent to their normal
storage locations.

## View failure location inventory

To view the product quantities stored in a failure location, navigate to
`Inventory
app --> Configuration --> Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select a failure location from the list. Then,
click the `Current Stock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button on the location\'s page.

A failure location\'s page lists all of the products stored within the
location, along with the quantity of each.

# Quality alerts

In the Odoo *Quality* app, *quality alerts* are used to notify quality
teams of product defects or other issues. Quality alerts can be created
from a manufacturing or inventory order, from a work order in the *Shop
Floor* module, or directly within the *Quality* app.

## Create quality alerts

There are multiple ways to create a new quality alert:

- **From the Quality app itself**, by to
  `Quality -->  Quality Control --> Quality
  Alerts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and then click
  `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open a quality alert form.

- Navigate to
  `Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}, and then select an [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|).
  Click the `Quality Alert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at
  the top of the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) to open a quality alert form in
  a new page.

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  This method can only be used if a quality check has been requested for
  the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|). The `Quality Alert`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} button will not appear otherwise.
  ::::

- Open the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app,
  click the `# To Process`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on
  an inventory order type card (Receipts, Delivery Orders, etc.), and
  then select an order. Click the `Quality Alert`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} button at the top of the order to open a quality
  alert form in a new page.

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  This method can only be used if a quality check has been requested for
  the inventory order. The `Quality Alert`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} button will not appear otherwise. If the button does
  not appear, a quality alert can also be created by clicking the
  `⚙️ (gear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon at the top of the
  page and selecting the `Quality Alert`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} option from the resulting menu.
  ::::

- Open the `Shop Floor`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} module,
  and then select a work center from the navigation bar at the top of
  the page. Then, click the `⋮ (three vertical dots)`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} button at the bottom-right of a work order card to
  open the `What do you want to do?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  menu. Select the `Create a Quality Alert`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} option from this menu to open a quality alert in a
  pop-up window.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Depending on how a new quality alert form is opened, certain fields on
the form may already be filled in. For example, if a quality alert is
created from a work order card in the *Shop Floor* module, the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Work Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are pre-filled.
::::

### Quality alerts form

After opening a new quality alert form, begin by giving it a short
`Title`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that summarizes the issue
with the product.

Then, if the quality alert is referencing:

- **A specific product or product variant**, select it from the
  `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Product Variant`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menus.
- **A specific work center**, select it from the
  `Work Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu.
- **A specific picking order**, select it from the
  `Picking`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu.

Next in the `Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select the
quality team that is responsible for managing the quality alert. If a
specific employee should be responsible for the quality alert, select
them from the `Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down
menu.

In the `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select any tags
relevant to the quality alert from the drop-down menu.

Use the `Root Cause`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to select
the cause of the quality issue, if known.

Lastly, choose a `Priority`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} level by
selecting a `⭐ (star)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} number
between one and three. Quality alerts with higher priorities appear at
the top of the `Quality Alerts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
Kanban board in the *Quality* app.

At the bottom of the quality alert form are four tabs which aid in
adding supplemental information or actions to be taken for the quality
alert. They can be filled out as follows:

- In the `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, enter a
  description of the quality issue.
- Use the `Corrective Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to
  detail the steps that should be taken to fix the issue.
- Use the `Preventive Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to
  detail what should be done to prevent the issue from occurring in the
  future.
- In the `Miscellaneous`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, select
  the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the product. If
  using an Odoo database which manages multiple companies, select the
  relevant company in the `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  field. Finally, specify when the alert was assigned to a quality team
  in the `Date Assigned`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![A quality alert form that has been filled out.](quality_alerts/alert-form.png){.align-center}

## Manage quality alerts

To view all existing quality alerts, navigate to
`Quality --> Quality Control -->
Quality Alerts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. By default,
alerts are displayed in a Kanban board view, which organizes them into
different stages based on where they are in the review process.

To move an alert to a different stage, simply drag and drop it on the
desired stage. Alternatively, select a quality alert to open it, and
then click the desired stage above the top-right corner of the quality
alert form.

To create a new alert within a specific stage, click the
`+ (plus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to the right of the
stage name. In the new alert card that appears below the stage title,
enter the `Title`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the alert, and
then click `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To configure the
rest of the alert, select the alert card to open its form.

# Quality checks

Quality checks are manual inspections conducted by employees, and are
used to ensure the quality of products. In Odoo, a quality check can be
conducted for a single product, or multiple products within the same
inventory operation or manufacturing order.

Using a Quality Control Point (QCP), it is possible to create quality
checks automatically at regular intervals. When quality checks are
created by a `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, they appear on a manufacturing or inventory order, where
the employee processing the order will be prompted to complete them. For
a full explanation of how to create and configure a
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, see the
documentation on `quality
control points <quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

While quality checks are most commonly created automatically by a
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, it is also
possible to manually create a single quality check. Creating a check
manually is useful when an employee wants to schedule a quality check
that will only occur once, or register a quality check that they conduct
unprompted.

## Manual quality check

To manually create a single quality check, navigate to
`Quality --> Quality Control
--> Quality Checks`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. On the quality check form,
begin by selecting an option from the `Control per`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu:

- `Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} requests a check for an
  entire operation (ex. delivery order) and all products within it.
- `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} requests a check for
  every unit of a product that is part of an operation (ex. every unit
  of a product within a delivery order).
- `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} requests a check for
  every quantity of a product that is part of an operation (ex. one
  check for five units of a product within a delivery order). Selecting
  `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} also causes a
  `Lot/Serial`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field to
  appear, from which can be selected a specific lot or serial number
  that the quality check should be conducted for.

Next, select an inventory operation from the `Picking`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu or a manufacturing order from the
`Production Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu.
This is necessary because Odoo needs to know for which operation the
quality check is being conducted.

If the quality check should be assigned to a specific
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, select it
from the `Control
Point`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu. This is useful
if the quality check is being created manually, but should still be
recognized as belonging to a specific
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Select a quality check type from the `Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down field:

- `Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} provides specific
  instructions for how to conduct the quality check.
- `Take a Picture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} requires a picture
  to be attached to the check before the check can be completed.
- `Print label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} opens a pop-up from
  which labels can be printed. This step can be customized to provide
  instructions about where to add the labels on a product.
- `Pass - Fail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is used when the
  product being checked must meet a certain criteria to pass the check.
- Selecting `Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} causes a
  `Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} input field to appear, in
  which a measurement must be entered before the check can be completed.
- Selecting `Worksheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} causes a
  `Quality Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field
  to appear. Use it to select a quality worksheet that must be filled
  out to complete the check.

In the `Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select the
quality team that is responsible for the quality check. In the
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select the company
that owns the product being inspected.

On the `Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab at the bottom of
the form, enter any relevant instructions in the
`Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} text entry box (ex.
\'Attach a picture of the product\'). In the `Notes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} text entry box, enter any relevant information about
the quality check (who created it, why it was created, etc.).

Finally, if the check is being processed immediately, click the
`Pass`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top left of the
screen if the check passes, or the `Fail`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button if the check fails.

![A quality check form filled out for a Pass - Fail check.](quality_checks/quality-check-form.png){.align-center}

## Process quality check

Quality checks can be processed directly on the quality check\'s page,
or from a manufacturing or inventory order for which a check is
required. Alternatively, if a quality check is created for a specific
work order operation, the check is processed in the *Shop Floor* module.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It is not possible to manually create a single quality check that is
assigned to a specific work order operation. Quality checks for work
order operations can only be created by a
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. See the
documentation on `Quality Control Points
<quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for information about how to configure a
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that will
create quality checks for a specific work order operation.
::::

### Quality check page

To process a quality check from the check\'s page, begin by navigating
to `Quality -->
Quality Control --> Quality Checks`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then select the check to process. Follow the
instructions for how to complete the check, listed in the
`Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field of the
`Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab at the bottom of the
page.

If the quality check passes, click the `Pass`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button at the top of the page. If the check fails,
click the `Fail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, instead.

### Quality check on order

To process a quality check on an order, select a manufacturing or
inventory order (receipt, delivery, return, etc.), for which a check is
required. Manufacturing orders can be selected by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and clicking on an order. Inventory orders can be
selected by navigating to `Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, clicking the `# To Process`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on an operation card, and selecting an order.

On the selected inventory or manufacturing order, a purple
`Quality Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button appears at
the top of the order. Click the button to open the
`Quality Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, which
shows all of the quality checks required for that order.

Follow the instructions that appear on the
`Quality Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window. If a
Pass - Fail check is being processed, complete the check by clicking
`Pass`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Fail`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} at the bottom of the pop-up window. For all other
quality check types, a `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button appears instead. Click it to complete the check.

![The \"Quality Check\" pop-up window on a manufacturing order.](quality_checks/quality-check-pop-up.png){.align-center}

### Quality check on work order

To process a quality check for a work order, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing
--> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select an [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) that includes a
work order for which a quality check is required.

On the [\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|), select the
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and then click the
`Open Work Order
(external link icon)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
line of the work order to be processed. On the resulting
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, click
the `Open Shop Floor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to open
the *Shop Floor* module.

::: seealso
For a full guide to the Shop Floor module, see the `Shop Floor overview
<../../manufacturing/shop_floor/shop_floor_overview>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation.
:::

When accessed from a specific work order, the *Shop Floor* module opens
to the page for the work center where the order is configured to be
processed, and isolates the work order\'s card so that no other cards
are shown.

Process the work order\'s steps until the quality check step is reached.
Click on the step to open a pop-up window that details how the check
should be completed. After following the instructions, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to complete the check.
Alternatively, if a *Pass - Fail* check is being processed, click either
the `Pass`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Fail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

It is also possible to complete a quality check by clicking the checkbox
on the right side of the step. Doing so automatically marks the check as
*Passed*.

:::: note

# Quality control points

In Odoo, *quality control points* (QCPs), are used to automatically
create `quality checks
<quality_checks>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} at predetermined
intervals. `QCPs (Quality Control Points)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} can be configured to create quality checks for specific
operations (manufacturing, delivery, etc.), as well as specific products
within those operations.

Using `QCPs (Quality Control Points)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
allows quality teams to ensure products are being regularly inspected
for defects and other issues.

## Configure quality control points

To create a new `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, navigate to
`Quality --> Quality Control --> Control Points`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and then click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Begin filling out the new
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by entering
a unique `Title`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that makes the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} easily
identifiable.

In the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select one
or more products the `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} should apply to. If the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} should
apply to an entire product category, select it in the
`Product Categories`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

In the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select the
operation(s) that should trigger the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. For
example, selecting the `Manufacturing`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option in the `Operations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field causes a quality check to be created for new
manufacturing orders (MOs).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When creating a new `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, at least one operation must be listed in the
`Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. However, the
`Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Product Categories`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields can be
left blank. If they are left blank, the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} generates
quality checks for every instance of the specified operation(s).
::::

If the `Manufacturing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} operation is
selected in the `Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, a
new field appears below it, titled
`Work Order Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. From this
field, select a specific work order to generate quality checks for that
operation, rather than the manufacturing operation, in general.

::: example
A `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} could be
configured to create quality checks for the [Assembly]{.title-ref} work
order of the [Coffee Table]{.title-ref} product. Then, if a new
[\|MO\|](##SUBST##|MO|) is confirmed for a [Coffee Table]{.title-ref},
the `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} creates
a quality check specifically for the [Assembly]{.title-ref} operation.
:::

The `Control Per`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set to one
of three options that determine *when* a new quality check is created:

- `Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: One check is requested
  for the specified operation, as a whole.
- `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: One check is requested
  for each *unique* product included in the specified operation. For
  example, a delivery operation for one table and four chairs would
  generate two checks, since two *unique* products are included in the
  operation.
- `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A check is requested
  for a certain percentage of items within the specified operation. This
  percentage is set by enabling the
  `Partial Transfer Test`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox,
  and then entering a numerical value in the
  `Percentage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field that appears
  below. If the checkbox is not enabled, one quality check is created
  for the full quantity.

The `Control Frequency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set
to one of three options that determine *how often* a new quality check
is created:

- `All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A quality check is requested
  every time the conditions of the
  `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are met.
- `Randomly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A quality check is
  randomly requested for a certain percentage of operations, which can
  be specified in the `Every #% of Operations`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field that appears below.
- `Periodically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A quality check is
  requested once every set period of time, which is specified by
  entering a numerical value in the field below, and choosing either
  `Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Weeks`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, or `Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
  the desired time interval.

In the `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, specify the type
of quality check that should be performed. The method for processing
quality checks created by the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} depends
upon the type of quality check selected:

- `Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checks provide
  specific instructions for how to complete the quality check.
- `Take a Picture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checks require a
  picture of the product be uploaded for later review by the assigned
  quality team.
- `Register Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checks prompt
  manufacturing employees to confirm the quantity of the product that
  was produced during the manufacturing operation.
- `Pass - Fail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checks specify a
  criterion that products must meet for the check to pass.
- `Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checks prompt employees
  to record a measurement of the product that must be within a tolerance
  of a norm value for the check to pass.
- `Worksheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checks require the
  employee processing the check to fill out an interactive worksheet.
- `Spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checks require the
  employee processing the check to fill out an interactive spreadsheet.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

An *Instructions* check is the same as a step on a work order for an MO.

When a step is added to a work order, Odoo stores it in the Quality app
as a `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. It is
possible to manually create a
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} with the
*Instructions* check type, and even assign it to an operation other than
manufacturing, like receipts.

However, when creating a control point specifically for quality control
purposes, using a different check type is probably more effective.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When creating a `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} with the `Worksheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} check types, it is
necessary to specify a *Quality Worksheet Template* or *Quality
Spreadsheet Template* in the `Template`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field that appears below the `Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

The selected template is duplicated for each quality check created by
the `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and
**must** be filled out to complete the quality check.

To create a new template, navigate to
`Quality app --> Configuration --> Quality
Worksheet/Spreadsheet Templates`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

In the `Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, specify the
quality team that is responsible for managing the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and the
quality checks it creates. If a specific quality team member is
responsible for the `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, select them in the `Responsible`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

The `Step Document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field has two
options that specify the location of an instructional document detailing
how to complete the quality checks created by the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Select `Specific Page of Operation Worksheet`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} if the document is included with the instructional
worksheet for the work order, then enter the page number in the
`Worksheet
Page`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field that appears below.

Select `Custom`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if the document
should be included in the `Instructions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab at the bottom of the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

In the `Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab at the
bottom of the form, enter instructions for how to complete the quality
checks created by the `QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

If the `Custom`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option was selected
in the `Step Document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field above, a
document can be attached in this tab. To do so, either select the
`Upload your file`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to open the
device\'s file manager, and then select a file, or add a link to a
Google Slides document in the `Google Slide Link`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

In the `Message If Failure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
include instructions for what to do if the quality check fails. For
example, instruct the employee processing the quality check to create a
`quality
alert <quality_alerts>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

The `Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab is used to provide
additional information about the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, like the
reason it was created. The information entered in this tab is **not**
shown to employees processing the quality checks created by the
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

# Process repair orders

Sometimes, products delivered to customers can break or be damaged in
transit, and need to be returned for a refund, delivery of a replacement
product, or repairs.

In Odoo, repairs for products returned by customers can be tracked in
the *Repairs* app. Once repaired, products can be redelivered to the
customer.

The return and repair process for damaged products typically follows the
below steps:

1.  `Process return order for damaged product <repairs/repair_orders/return-order>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
2.  `Create repair order for returned product <repairs/repair_orders/repair>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
3.  `Return repaired product to customer <repairs/repair_orders/return-customer>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

## Return order {#repairs/repair_orders/return-order}

Returns can be processed in Odoo via *reverse transfers*, created
directly from a sales order (SO) once products have been delivered to a
customer.

To create a return, navigate to the `Sales app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click into an
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} from which a product
should be returned. Then, from the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} form, click the `Delivery`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button. Doing so opens the delivery order (DO)
form.

From this form, click `Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This
opens a `Reverse Transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window.

![Reverse transfer pop-up window on delivery order form.](repair_orders/repair-orders-reverse-transfer.png){.align-center}

This pop-up lists the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
included in the order, the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
delivered to the customer, and the `Unit of Measure`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} the product was in.

Click the value in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field to change the quantity of the product to be returned, if
necessary.

Click the `🗑️ (trash)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon at the
far-right of the product line to remove it from the return, if
necessary.

Once ready, click `Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm
the return. This creates a new receipt for the returned products.

Once the product has been returned to the warehouse, receipt of the
return can be registered in the database by clicking
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the reverse transfer
form.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Once a reverse transfer for a return is validated, the value in the
`Delivered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column on the original
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} updates to reflect the
difference between the original `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} ordered, and the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} returned by the customer.

![Delivered and Quantity columns on sales order after return.](repair_orders/repair-orders-quantity-delivered.png){.align-center}
::::

## Create repair order {#repairs/repair_orders/repair}

Once products have been returned, their repairs can be tracked by
creating a repair order (RO).

To create a new `RO (Repair Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
navigate to `Repairs app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This opens a blank
`RO (Repair Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form.

![Left-hand side of blank repair order form.](repair_orders/repair-orders-left-hand-form.png){.align-center}

On this form, begin by selecting a `Customer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The customer selected should be for whom the order
will be invoiced and delivered.

In the `Product to Repair`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
click the drop-down menu to select the product that needs repair. If
necessary, click `Search More...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
open a `Search: Product to
Repair`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, and browse all
products in the database.

Once a `Product to Repair`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
selected, a new `Product Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field appears below it. In that field, enter the quantity (in a
[0.00]{.title-ref} format) of the product that requires repair.

To the right of that value, click the drop-down list to select the unit
of measure (UoM) for the product.

In the `Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, click the
drop-down menu and select the return order from which the product to be
repaired comes from.

Tick the `Under Warranty`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox,
if the product being repaired is covered by a warranty. If ticked, the
`Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is not charged for all the
parts used in the repair order.

In the `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, click
the date to reveal a calendar popover window. From this calendar, select
a date for the repair, and click `Apply`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Right-hand side of blank repair order form.](repair_orders/repair-orders-completed-repair-form.png){.align-center}

In the `Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, click the
drop-down menu and select the user who should be responsible for the
repair.

In the `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, if in a
multi-company environment, select which company this
`RO (Repair Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} belongs to.

In the `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, click the
drop-down menu and select which tags should be applied to this
`RO (Repair Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

### Parts tab

Add, remove, or recycle parts in the `Parts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. To do so, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} at the bottom of the form.

In the `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, click the box
to reveal three options to choose from: `Add`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} (selected by default), `Remove`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `Recycle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Type column options or new part under Parts tab.](repair_orders/repair-orders-type-column.png){.align-center}

Choosing `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} adds this part to the
`RO (Repair Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Adding parts lists
components for use in the repair. If the components are used, the user
completing the repair can record they were used. If they were not used,
the user can indicate that, too, and the components can be saved for
another use.

Choosing `Remove`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} removes this part
from the `RO (Repair Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Removing
parts lists components that should be removed from the product being
repaired during the repair process. If the parts are removed, the user
completing the repair can indicate they were removed.

Choosing `Recycle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} recycles this part
from the `RO (Repair Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, designating
it for later use or to be repurposed for another use in the warehouse.

In the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, select which
product (part) should be added, removed, or recycled. In the
`Demand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, change the quantity,
if necessary, to indicate what quantity of this part should be used in
the repair process.

In the `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, change the
value (in a [0.00]{.title-ref} format) once the part has been
successfully added, removed, or recycled.

In the `Unit of Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column,
select the `UoM (Unit of Measure)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for
the part.

Finally, in the `Used`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, tick
the checkbox once the part has been used in the repair process.

To add additional columns to the line, click the
`(optional columns drop-down)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon,
at the far-right of the header row. Select the desired options to add to
the line.

![Optional additional options to add to new part line.](repair_orders/repair-orders-additional-options.png){.align-center}

### Repair Notes and Miscellaneous tabs

Click the `Repair Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to add
internal notes about this specific `RO (Repair Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, and anything the user performing the repair might need to
know.

Click the blank text field to begin writing notes.

Click the `Miscellaneous`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to see
the `Operation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for this repair.
By default, this is set to `YourCompany: Repairs`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, indicating this is a repair type operation.

Once all desired configurations have been made on the
`RO (Repair Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form, click
`Confirm Repair`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This moves the
`RO (Repair Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to the
`Confirmed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage, and reserves the
necessary components needed for the repair.

A new `Forecasted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column appears on
the product lines under the `Parts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, displaying the availability of all components needed for the
repair.

Once ready, click `Start Repair`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
This moves the `RO (Repair Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to the
`Under Repair`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage (in the
upper-right corner). If the `RO (Repair Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} should be cancelled, click
`Cancel Repair`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Once all products have been successfully repaired, the
`RO (Repair Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is completed. To
register this in the database, click `End Repair`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If all parts added to the `RO (Repair Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} were not used, clicking `End Repair`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} causes an `Uncomplete Move(s)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window to appear.

![Uncomplete Moves pop-up window for unused parts.](repair_orders/repair-orders-uncomplete-moves.png){.align-center}

The pop-up window informs the user that there is a difference between
the initial demand and the actual quantity used for the order.

If the `Used`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} quantity should be
changed, click `Discard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or close the
pop-up window. If the order should be confirmed, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

This moves the `RO (Repair Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to the
`Repaired`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage. A
`Product Moves`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button also
appears above the form.

Click the `Product Moves`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button to view the product\'s moves history during and after the repair
process.

### Return product to customer {#repairs/repair_orders/return-customer}

#### Product is under warranty

Once the product has been successfully repaired, it can be returned to
the customer.

#### Product is not under warranty

If the product is not under warranty, or should the customer bear the
repair costs, click `Create Quotation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. This opens a new `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} form, pre-populated with the parts used in the
`RO (Repair Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, with the total cost
of the repair calculated.

![Pre-populated new quotation for parts included in repair order.](repair_orders/repair-orders-new-quotation.png){.align-center}

to the customer, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
proceed to invoice the customer for the repair.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If the customer should be charged for a repair service, a service type
product can be created and added to the
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for a repaired
product.
::::

To return the product to the customer, navigate to the
`Sales app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select the
original `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} from which
the initial return was processed. Then, click the
`Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button.

From the resulting list of operations, click the reverse transfer,
indicated by the `Source Document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
which should read [Return of WH/OUT/XXXXX]{.title-ref}.

This opens the return form. At the top of this form, a
`Repair Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button now
appears, linking this return to the completed
`RO (Repair Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Click `Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the
form. This opens a `Reverse Transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window.

![Reverse transfer pop-up window on delivery order form.](repair_orders/repair-orders-reverse-transfer.png){.align-center}

This pop-up lists the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
included in the order, the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
delivered to the customer, and the `Unit of Measure`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} the product was in.

Click the value in the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field to change the quantity of the product to be returned, if
necessary.

Click the `🗑️ (trash)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon at the
far-right of the product line to remove it from the return, if
necessary.

Once ready, click `Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm
the return. This creates a new delivery for the returned products.

When the delivery has been processed and the product has been returned
to the customer, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
validate the delivery.

# Convert leads into opportunities

*Leads* act as a qualifying step before an opportunity is created. This
provides additional time to review its potential, and gauge its
viability, before the opportunity is assigned to a salesperson.

## Configuration

To activate the *Leads* setting, navigate to
`CRM app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and check the box labeled,
`Leads`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Leads setting on CRM configuration page.](convert/convert-leads-leads-setting.png){.align-center}

Activating this feature adds a new menu option,
`Leads`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, to the header bar, located
along the top of the screen.

![Leads menu on CRM application.](convert/convert-leads-leads-menu.png){.align-center}

Once the *Leads* setting has been activated, it applies to all sales
teams by default. To turn off leads for a specific team, navigate to
`CRM app --> Configuration --> Sales Teams`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, select a team from the list to open that
team\'s configuration page. Clear the `Leads`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox, located beneath the
`Sales Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, then click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Leads menu on CRM application.](convert/convert-leads-leads-button.png){.align-center}

## Convert a lead into an opportunity

To convert a lead into an *opportunity*, navigate to
`CRM app --> Leads`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click
on a lead from the list to open it.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

If a `Similar Leads`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button
appears at the top of the page for the lead, it indicates a similar lead
or opportunity already exists in the database. Before converting this
lead, click the smart button to confirm if the lead should be merged.

![Close up of a lead with emphasis on the Similar Leads smart button.](convert/similar-leads-smart-button.png){.align-center}
::::

Click the `Convert to Opportunity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button, located at the top-left of the page.

![Create opportunity button on a lead record.](convert/convert-leads-convert-opp-button.png){.align-center}

This opens a `Convert to opportunity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up modal. Here, in the `Conversion
Action`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select the
`Convert to opportunity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To merge this lead with an existing similar lead or opportunity, select
`Merge with
existing opportunities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Conversion Action`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. This
generates a list of the similar leads/opportunities to be merged.

When merging, Odoo gives priority to whichever lead/opportunity was
created in the system first, merging the information into the first
created lead/opportunity. However, if a lead and an opportunity are
being merged, the resulting record is referred to as an opportunity,
regardless of which record was created first.
::::

Then, select a `Salesperson`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a
`Sales Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to which the opportunity
should be assigned. Neither field is required, though if a selection is
made in the `Salesperson`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, the
`Sales Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is populated
automatically, based on the salesperson\'s team assignments.

If the lead has already been assigned to a salesperson or a team, these
fields automatically populate with that information.

![Create opportunity pop-up.](convert/convert-leads-conversion-action.png){.align-center}

Under the `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading, choose
from the following options:

- `Create a new customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: choose
  this option to use the information in the lead to create a new
  customer record.
- `Link to an existing customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  choose this option, then select a customer from the resulting
  drop-down menu, to link this opportunity to an existing customer
  record.
- `Do not link to a customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: choose
  this option to convert the lead, but not link it to a new or existing
  customer.

Lastly, when all configurations are complete, click
`Create Opportunity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To view the newly created opportunity, navigate to
`CRM app --> My Pipeline`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

:::: note

:::

Some filters may need to be removed from the
`Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar on the top
`Pipeline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page to view all
opportunities.

# Create leads (from email or manually)

Leads can be added to the *CRM* app from custom email aliases, and by
manually creating new records. This is in addition to the leads and
opportunities created in the app through the
`website contact form <opportunities_form>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

First, ensure the *Leads* feature is enabled in the database by
navigating to `CRM
app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Tick the `Leads`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox, then click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

## Configure email aliases {#crm/configure_email_alias}

Each sales team has the option to create and utilize their own unique
email alias. When messages are sent to this address, a lead (or
opportunity), is created with the information from the message.

To create or update a sales teams\' email alias, navigate to
`CRM app -->
Configuration --> Sales Teams`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Click on a team from the list to open the team\'s details page.

![The sales team details page, focused on the email alias section.](email_manual/email-alias.png){.align-center}

In the `Email Alias`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, enter a
name for the email alias, or edit the existing name. In the
`Accept Emails From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, use the
drop-down menu to choose who is allowed to send messages to this email
alias:

- `Everyone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: messages are accepted
  from any email address.
- `Authenticated Partners`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: only
  accepts messages from email addresses associated with a a partner
  (contact or customer) record.
- `Followers only`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: only accepts
  messages from those who are following a record related to the team,
  such as a lead or opportunity. Messages are also accepted from team
  members.
- `Authenticated Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: only
  accepts messages from email addresses that are connected to a record
  in the *Employees* app.

### Leads created from email

Leads created from email alias messages can be viewed by navigating to
`CRM app -->
Leads`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Click a lead from the
list to open it, and view the details.

The email received by the alias is added to the *chatter* thread for the
lead. The subject line of the message is added to the title field, and
the `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is updated with the
contact\'s email address.

### Manually create opportunities

To manually create an opportunity, navigate to
`CRM app --> Sales --> My Pipeline`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. At the top-left of the page, click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a new opportunity
Kanban card. In the `Organization/Contact`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, enter the name of the company the opportunity is
for.

Choose a name, and enter it in the `Opportunity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. *This is a required field.* When manually
creating an opportunity, it is helpful to add a name that relates to the
details of the opportunity.

::: example
In the example below, the opportunity is named [5 VP
Chairs]{.title-ref}. This identifies the product the customer is
interested in, as well as the potential number of products.

![An example of an opportunity in the CRM pipeline.](email_manual/opportunity-example.png){.align-center}
:::

Enter the contact information for the opportunity in the
`Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `Phone`{.interpreted-text

and `../track_leads/lead_scoring`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} for more
information.
::::

Then, use the `fa-star-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(star)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icons to assign a priority.

- `fa-star-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `fa-star-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `fa-star-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}: low priority
- `fa-star`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `fa-star-o`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} `fa-star-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}: medium
  priority
- `fa-star`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `fa-star`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} `fa-star-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}: high priority
- `fa-star`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `fa-star`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} `fa-star`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}: very high
  priority

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Assigning a priority changes the order of leads in Kanban view, with
higher priority leads displayed first.

# Create opportunities from web contact forms

Adding a contact form to a website makes it easy to convert visitors
into leads and opportunities. After a visitor submits their information,
an opportunity can be created automatically, and assigned to a
designated sales team and salesperson.

## Customize contact forms {#crm/customize-contact-form}

By default, the *Contact Us* page on an Odoo website displays a
preconfigured contact form. This form can be customized, as needed, to
suit the needs of a specific sales team.

Navigate to `Website app --> Contact Us`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then click `Edit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the top-right of the screen to open the web editor.
Click on the form building block in the body of the webpage to open the
form configuration settings on the right sidebar. The following options
are available to customize the contact form from the
`From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the right sidebar:

![The form configuration settings on an Odoo website.](opportunities_form/form-customization.png){.align-center}

- `Action`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the default action for a
  contact form is `Send an Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  Select `Create an Opportunity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from
  the drop-down list to capture the information in the *CRM* app.
- `Sales Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: choose a sales team
  from the drop-down menu that the opportunities from this form should
  be assigned to. This field **only** appears if the
  `Action`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set to
  `Create an Opportunity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Salesperson`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the opportunities
  should be assigned to a specific salesperson, select them from the
  drop-down menu. If no selection is made in this field, the
  opportunities are assigned based on the team\'s existing rules.
- `Marked Fields`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: use this field to
  alter how the form handles marked fields. The default option is to
  treat marked fields as `Required`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  which is the recommended setting.
- `Mark Text`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: choose how
  `Marked Fields`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should be
  identified. The default character is an asterisk ([\*]{.title-ref}).
- `Labels Width`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: use this field to
  alter the pixel width of the labels, if desired.
- `On Success`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select how the
  webpage reacts after a customer successfully submits a form.
  `Nothing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} keeps the customer on the
  same screen, with the addition of a confirmation message that the form
  was submitted successfully. `Redirect`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} sends the customer to a new webpage, based on the
  address provided in the `URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
  below. `Show Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} replaces the
  form with a preconfigured message that informs the customer someone
  should respond to them as soon as possible.
- `URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if
  `Redirect`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected in the
  `On Success`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, enter the URL
  for the webpage, where customers should be directed after successfully
  submitting a form.
- `Visibility`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: use the drop-down
  menu to add any visibility conditions for this field, if desired.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If *leads* are activated in *CRM* settings, selecting
`Create an Opportunity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} generates a
lead instead. To activate leads, navigate to
`CRM app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and tick the
`Leads`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox. Then, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

### Customize contact form fields

In addition to the settings for the form, the settings for each field
can be customized, as well. With the web editor menu still open, click
into a field to open the `Field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
configuration settings section on the sidebar. The following options are
available to customize a field:

- `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: choose a custom field
  option or an existing field type.
- `Input Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: determine the type of
  information customers should input. Available options are
  `Text`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Email`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Telephone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Url`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The selection made in this
  field limits the format that customers can use when entering
  information.
- `Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the name for the
  field.
- `Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: choose the way the
  label is aligned with the rest of the form. The label can be hidden,
  above the field, to the left of the field, or right adjusted and
  closer to the field.
- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: slide the toggle to
  add a description for the field, which can provide additional
  instructions to customers. Click under the field on the form to add
  the description.
- `Placeholder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter an example to
  help users know how to input information where formatting is
  important, such as a phone number or email address.
- `Default Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter a value to
  include in the form, by default, if the customer does not provide
  information in the field. *It is not recommended to include a default
  value for required fields*.
- `Required`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: slide the toggle to
  mark this field as required if it **must** be filled in for every
  submission.
- `Visibility`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select when this
  field should be visible. Use the button on the left to choose whether
  to show or hide this field on a desktop users. Use the button on the
  right to choose whether to show or hide this field to mobile users.
- `Animation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select if this field
  should have any animation.

![The field configuration settings on an Odoo website.](opportunities_form/field-customization.png){.align-center}

## View opportunities

After a customer submits a contact form, and an opportunity is created,
it is assigned based on the
`form settings <crm/customize-contact-form>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. To view opportunities, navigate to
`CRM app --> Sales --> My Pipeline`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

:::: note

# Create and send quotations

Once a qualified lead has been converted into an opportunity, the next
step is to create and deliver a quotation. This process can be easily
handled through Odoo\'s *CRM* application.

## Create a new quotation

To create a new quotation, open the `CRM app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, revealing the `Pipeline`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page on the main *CRM* dashboard.

From here, click on any opportunity to open it. Review the existing
information and update any fields, if necessary.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If a quotation has already been created for this opportunity, it can be
found by clicking on the `Quotations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
smart button at the top of the top of the form. The number of existing
quotations is listed on the smart button, as well.
::::

At the top-left of the form, click the `New Quotation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

![Qualified lead form with New Quotation button emphasized.](send_quotes/send-quotes-new-button.png){.align-center}

The **Sales** application **must** be installed for the
`New Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to appear.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is **not**
required on the opportunity form.

However, customer information must be added or linked before a quotation
can be sent. If the `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
is left blank on the opportunity, clicking the `New
Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button opens a pop-up
window with the following options:

- `Create a new customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: creates a
  new customer record, using any available information provided on the
  opportunity form.
- `Link to an existing customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  opens a drop-down field with existing customer names. Select a name to
  link this new quotation to an existing customer record.
- `Do not link to a customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  quotation will **not** be linked to a customer, and no changes are
  made to the customer information.
::::

Once this button is clicked, a new quotation form appears. Confirm the
information in the top half of the form, and update any missing or
incorrect fields:

- `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the company or contact
  for whom this quotation was created.
- `Referrer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if this customer was
  referred by another customer or contact, select it from the drop-down
  menu in this field.
- `Invoice Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: physical address
  where the invoice should be sent.
- `Delivery Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: physical
  address where any products should be delivered.
- `Quotation Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if
  applicable, select a pre-configured `quotation template
  <../../sales/sales_quotations/quote_template>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} from this field.
- `Expiration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: date when this
  quotation is no longer valid.
- `Quotation Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: creation date of
  draft/sent orders, confirmation date of confirmed orders. Note that
  this field is only visible if `Developer mode (debug mode)
  </applications/general/developer_mode>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
  is active.
- `Recurring Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if this quotation
  is for a recurring product or subscription, select the recurring plan
  configuration to be used.
- `Pricelist`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select a pricelist to
  be applied to this order.
- `Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select any
  applicable payment terms for this quotation.

![Qualified lead form with New Quotation button emphasized.](send_quotes/send-quotes-new-quotation.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The `Expiration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field automatically
populates based on the creation date of the quotation, and the default
validity time frame.

To update the default validity time frame, navigate to `Sales app -->
Configuration --> Settings --> Quotations & Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and update the `Default Quotation
Validity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. To disable automatic
expiration, enter [0]{.title-ref} in this field.

When the desired changes are complete, click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

When using a quotation template, the expiration date is based off of the
`Quotation
Validity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the template. To
alter the validity date computation on a template, go to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Sales Orders --> Quotation Templates`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Then, click on a template to open it, and update the number in the
`Quotation Validity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
::::

### Order lines

After updating the customer, payment, and deadline information on the
new quotation, the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
can be updated with the appropriate product information.

To do that, click `Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

Next, type the name of an item into the `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field to search through the product catalog. Then,
select a product from the drop-down menu, or create a new one by
selecting `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Create and Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

After selecting a product, update the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, if necessary. Confirm the information in the remaining
fields.

To remove a line from the quotation, click the
`fa-trash-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(trash can)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon.

To organize products into sections click
`Add a section`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and type a name for
the section. Then, click the `oi-draggable`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(drag)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the
left of the name and drag to move the section to the appropriate
location. Move each product using the same method to finish organizing
the quotation order lines.

![Categories are used to create separate sections on the order lines of a quote.](send_quotes/product-sections.png){.align-center}

#### Product catalog

To quickly add numerous products to the quotation, click the
`Catalog`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to open the product
catalog.

All products in the database are listed as cards and can be sorted in
the left panel by `Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Attributes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The product catalog displays all products as cards.](send_quotes/product-catalog.png){.align-center}

To add a product, click the `fa-shopping-cart`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
product card. Set the quantity of the item using the
`fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(add)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `fa-minus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(subtract)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons, or type the
quantity in the number field between the two buttons. To remove an item,
click the `fa-trash`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Remove`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the product card.

![The purple add and subtract buttons are used to set the quantity of an item.](send_quotes/set-quantity.png){.align-center}

Once all product quantities are set, click the
`Back to Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to return
to the quotation. The items selected in the product catalog now appear
in the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

## Preview and send quotation

To see a preview of the quotation as the customer will see it, click the
`Preview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. Doing so opens a
preview in the `Customer Portal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

After reviewing the customer preview, click
`Return to edit mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to return to
the quotation form in the backend.

When the quotation is ready to deliver to the customer, click the
`Send by Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

Doing so opens a pop-up window with a pre-configured email message.
Information from the quotation, including the contact information, total
cost, and quotation title are be imported from the quotation.

A PDF of the quotation is added as an attachment to the email.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

A pre-loaded template is used to create the email message. To alter the
template, click the internal link to the right of the
`Load template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, located at the
bottom of the email pop-up window.

To select a new template, select an option from the
`Load template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu.
::::

Proceed to make any necessary changes to the email, then click
`Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. A copy of the message is
added to the *Chatter* of the of the record.

After a quotation is sent, the originating opportunity\'s
`Quotations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button updates
with a new count. This quotation, and all other quotations can be
accessed through this smart button at the top of the opportunity in the
*CRM* app.

Any quotations attached to the opportunity that are confirmed, and have
therefore been converted to sales orders, will be deducted from the
number listed on the `Quotations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
smart button. Instead, the value of the sales order will appear in the
`Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button located in the
same control panel.

## Mark an opportunity won or lost

In order to keep the pipeline up to date and accurate, opportunities
need to be identified as *won* or *lost* once a customer has responded
to a quotation.

To mark an opportunity as *won* or *lost*, return to the opportunity
using the breadcrumbs at the top-left of the quotation form. Or navigate
to `CRM app --> Sales --> My Pipeline`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click on the correct opportunity to open it.

At the top-left of the form, click on either the `Won`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

If the opportunity is marked *won*, a green `Won`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} banner is added to the record, and it is moved to the
`Won`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage.

Marking an opportunity as *lost*, via the `Lost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button opens a `Mark Lost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window, where a `Lost Reason`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} can be entered.

From the `Lost Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down
field, choose an existing lost reason. If no applicable reason is
available, create a new one by entering it into the
`Lost Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and clicking
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

It\'s best practice to try and use pre-configured
`Lost Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} values as much as
possible or to limit the creation of new values only to sales team
leads. Using consistent values for this parameter will make pipeline
analysis easier and more accurate when filtering for the
`Lost Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} parameter.

To set up new values for this field, navigate to
`CRM --> Configuration --> Lost
Reasons`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click both
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for each new entry added to the list.
::::

Additional notes and comments can be added in the
`Closing Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

When all the desired information has been entered in the
`Mark Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, click
`Mark as Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Upon clicking `Mark as Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
pop-up window disappears, and Odoo returns to the opportunity form,
where a new red `Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner is now
present in the upper-right corner of the opportunity.

Once an opportunity is marked as *lost*, it is no longer considered
active, and it is removed from the pipeline.

In order to view a *lost* opportunity from the pipeline, click the
`down arrow icon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the right of the
search bar, and select either `Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
or `Archived`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu
that appears.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

While opportunities that have been marked as *lost* are considered
*Archived*, be advised that, in order for an opportunity to be included
as *lost* in reporting, it **must** be specifically marked as *lost*,
not *Archived*.

  badge can only be granted by users who have already been awarded a
  specific badge. If this option is selected it generates a new field,
  `Required Badges`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Use this
  drop-down list to select the badge(s) a user must have before they can
  award this badge to others.
- `No one, assigned through challenges`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: this badge cannot be manually granted, it can only
  be awarded through challenges.

To limit the number of badges a user can send, tick the
`Monthly Limited Spending`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.
This sets a limit on the number of times a user can grant this badge. In

# Lead enrichment

*Lead enrichment* is a service that provides business information for a
contact attached to a lead. Lead enrichment is an In-App Purchase (IAP)
that requires credits to use, and is available for existing leads in an
Odoo database.

The information provided by lead enrichment can include general
information about the business (including full business name and logo),
social media accounts, `Company type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Founded`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
information, `Sectors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} information,
the number of `Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Estimated revenue`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} number,
`Timezone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Technologies Used`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Enterprise Odoo users with a valid subscription get free credits to test
`IAP (In-App
Purchase)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} features before deciding to
purchase more credits for the database. This includes demo/training
databases, educational databases, and one-app-free databases.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The *leads* feature **must** be activated in the *CRM* settings page in
order to use lead enrichment. To access the *CRM* settings, navigate to
`CRM app --> Configuration
--> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Under the
`CRM`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section activate the
`Leads`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option and click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

## Lead enrichment set up

To set up lead enrichment in the *CRM* application, navigate to
`CRM app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Then, under the `Lead Generation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section, tick the checkbox next to `Lead Enrichment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and select either
`Enrich leads on demand only`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Enrich all leads automatically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Click the `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to activate
the changes.

![CRM lead generation settings page, with lead enrichment activation highlighted, and enrich
leads on demand only chosen.](lead_enrichment/lead-enrichment-activate.png){.align-center}

## Enrich leads

Enrichment of leads is based on the domain of the email address of the
customer set on the lead. There are two different ways that a lead can
be enriched: *automatically* or *manually*.

### Automatically enrich leads

During set up, if `Enrich all leads automatically`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} was selected on the *CRM* `Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, then no action needs to be taken by the user to
enrich the lead. A scheduled action runs automatically, every sixty
minutes, and enrichment occurs on leads, after a remote database is
contacted.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To access the cron that runs for the automatic lead enrichment, activate
`developer mode
<developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and navigate to
`Settings app --> Technical menu --> Automation
section --> Scheduled Actions`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
In the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar, type in
[CRM]{.title-ref}. Click into the result labeled
`CRM: enrich leads (IAP)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and make
any necessary adjustments. In the `Execute Every`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, enter a value greater than, or equal to, five
minutes.
::::

::: example
The following is an example of lead enrichment data that has been
autocompleted successfully:

![Chatter showing lead enrichment data.](lead_enrichment/lead-enrichment-data.png){.align-center}

### Manually enrich leads

If the `Enrich leads on demand only`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option was selected on the *CRM* `Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, when activating
`Lead Enrichment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, each lead that a
user wishes to enrich **must** be manually enriched. This is achieved by
clicking the `Enrich`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
top menu of the lead.

The same information will be retrieved at the same
`IAP (In-App Puchase)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} credit cost (one
per enrichment). This method of enrichment is useful when every lead
does not need to be enriched, or cost is an issue.

![Manual enrich button feature highlighted on the CRM lead.](lead_enrichment/manual-enrichment.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Manually enrich leads in bulk using the *list* view. First, navigate to
`CRM app
--> Leads`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click the list
view button (`☰ (three horizontal lines)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon). Next, tick the checkboxes for the leads that
should be manually enriched. Finally, click the
`⚙️ Action`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, and select
`Enrich`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the resulting drop-down
menu. This can also be achieved from the *My Pipeline* page. To do so,
simply open the *CRM* app, or navigate to
`CRM app --> Sales --> My Pipeline`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Either route reveals leads and opportunities on
the `Pipeline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.

Lead enrichment is an In-App Purchase (IAP) feature, and each enriched
lead costs one credit.

## Enrich contacts with corporate data

From any module, as the user is typing in the name of a new company
contact, Odoo reveals a large drop-down menu of potential match
suggestions. If any are selected, the contact is then populated with
corporate data related to that specific selection.

For example, after typing [Odoo]{.title-ref}, the following information
populates:

# Utilize activities for sales teams

*Activities* are follow-up tasks tied to a record in an *Odoo* database.
Activities can be scheduled on any page of the database that contains a
chatter thread, Kanban view, list view, or activities view of an
application.

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="utilize_activities/activities-view.png"

</figure>

## Activity types

A set of preconfigured activity types is available in the *CRM* app. To
view the list of available activity types, navigate to the
`CRM app --> Configuration --> Activity Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Additional activity types are available within the database, and can be
utilized through different applications. To access the complete list of
activity types, go to the `Settings app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then scroll to the `Discuss`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, and click `Activity Types`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

The preconfigured activity types for the *CRM* app are as follows:

> - `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: adds a reminder to the
>   chatter that prompts the salesperson to send an email.
> - `Call`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: opens a calendar link
>   where the salesperson can schedule time to call the contact.
> - `Meeting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: opens a calendar link
>   where the salesperson can schedule time to have a meeting with the
>   contact.
> - `To Do`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: adds a general reminder
>   task to the chatter.
> - `Upload Document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: adds a link on
>   the activity where an external document can be uploaded. Note that
>   the *Documents* app is **not** required to utilize this activity
>   type.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If other applications are installed, such as *Sales* or *Accounting*,
other activity types are made available in the *CRM* app.
::::

### Create a new activity type {#crm/create-new-activity-type}

To create a new activity type, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} at the top-left of the page to open a blank form.

At the top of the form, start by choosing a `Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for the new activity type.

#### Activity settings

##### Action

The *Action* field specifies the intent of the activity. Some actions
trigger specific behaviors after an activity is scheduled.

- If `Upload Document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, a
  link to upload a document is added directly to the planned activity in
  the chatter.
- If either `Phonecall`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Meeting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are selected, users have
  the option to open their calendar to schedule a time for this
  activity.
- If `Request Signature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected,
  a link is added to the planned activity in the chatter that opens a
  signature request pop-up window.

![The Activity settings on a new activity type with emphasis on the Action field.](utilize_activities/action-field.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The actions available to select on an activity type vary, depending on
the applications currently installed in the database.
::::

##### Default user

To automatically assign this activity to a specific user when this
activity type is scheduled, choose a name from the
`Default User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu. If
this field is left blank, the activity is assigned to the user who
creates the activity.

##### Default summary

To include notes whenever this activity type is created, enter them into
the `Default
Summary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The information in the `Default User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Default Summary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields are
included when an activity is created. However, they can be altered
before the activity is scheduled or saved.
::::

#### Next activity

To automatically suggest, or trigger, a new activity after an activity
has been marked complete, the `Chaining Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} must be set.

##### Suggest next activity

In the `Chaining Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select
`Suggest Next Activity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Upon doing
so, the field underneath changes to: `Suggest`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Click the `Suggest`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field drop-down menu to select any activities to recommend as follow-up
tasks to this activity type.

![The Next Activity section on a new activity type form.](utilize_activities/next-activity.png){.align-center}

In the `Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, choose a
default deadline for these activities. To do so, configure a desired
number of `Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Weeks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, decide if it should
occur `after completion date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`after previous activity
deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

This `Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field information can
be altered before the activity is scheduled.

When all configurations are complete, click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If an activity has the `Chaining Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} set to `Suggest Next Activity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and has activities listed in the
`Suggest`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, users are presented
with recommendations for activities as next steps.

![A schedule activity pop-up with emphasis on the recommended activities.](utilize_activities/suggest-next-activity.png){.align-center}
::::

##### Trigger next activity

Setting the `Chaining Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Trigger Next Activity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} immediately
launches the next activity once the previous one is completed.

If `Trigger Next Activity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
selected in the `Chaining Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, the field beneath changes to: `Trigger`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. From the `Trigger`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field drop-down menu, select the activity that should be launched once
this activity is completed.

In the `Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, choose a
default deadline for these activities. To do so, configure a desired
number of `Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Weeks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, decide if it should
occur `after completion date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`after previous activity
deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

This `Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field information can
be altered before the activity is scheduled.

When all configurations are complete, click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When an activity has the `Chaining Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} set to `Trigger Next Activity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, marking the activity as *Done* immediately launches
the next activity listed in the `Trigger`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.
::::

## Activity tracking

To keep the pipeline up to date with the most accurate view of the
status of activities, as soon as a lead is interacted with, the
associated activity should be marked as *Done*. This ensures the next
activity can be scheduled as needed. It also prevents the pipeline from
becoming cluttered with past due activities.

The pipeline is most effective when it is kept up-to-date and accurate
to the interactions it is tracking.

## Activity plans {#crm/activity-plans}

*Activity plans* are preconfigured sequences of activities. When an
activity plan is launched, every activity in the sequence is scheduled
automatically.

To create a new plan, navigate to
`CRM app --> Configuration --> Activity Plan`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at
the top-left of the page to open a blank `Lead Plans`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} form.

Enter a name for the new plan in the `Plan Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. On the `Activities to
Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add a new activity.

Select an `Activity Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
drop-down menu. Click `Search More`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to see a complete list of available activity types, or to create a
`new one
<crm/create-new-activity-type>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Next, in the `Summary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, enter
any details to describe the specifics of the activity, including
instructions for the salesperson or information due upon the completion
of the activity. The contents of this field are included with the
scheduled activity, and can be edited later.

In the `Assignment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select one
of the following options:

> - `Ask at launch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: activities are
>   assigned to a user when the plan is scheduled.
> - `Default user`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: activities are
>   always assigned to a specific user.

If `Default user`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected in the
`Assignment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, choose a user in
the `Assigned to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Activity plans can feature activities that are assigned to default users
and users assigned at the plan launch.

![A Lead Plan form with scheduled activities.](utilize_activities/create-activity-plan.png){.align-center}
::::

Next, configure the timeline for the activity. Activities can be
scheduled to occur either before the plan date or after. Use the
`Interval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Units`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields to set the deadline
for this activity. Lastly, in the `Trigger`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, select whether the activity should occur before
or after the plan date.

::: example
An activity plan is created to handle high priority leads. Specifically,
these leads should be contacted quickly, with a meeting scheduled within
two days of the initial contact. The plan is configured with the
following activities:

- Email two days **before** plan date
- Meeting zero days **before** plan date
- Make quote three days **after** plan date
- Upload document three days **after** plan date
- Follow-up five days **after** plan date

This sets the *plan date* as the meeting deadline, which is the
objective of the plan. Before that date, there is lead time to contact
the customer and prepare for the meeting. After that date, the
salesperson has time to create a quote, upload the document, and
follow-up.
:::

Repeat these steps for each activity included in the plan.

### Launch an activity plan

To launch an activity plan on a *CRM* opportunity, navigate to
`CRM app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and click on the
Kanban card of an opportunity to open it.

At the top-right of the chatter, click `Activities`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to open the `Schedule
Activity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

In the `Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select the
desired activity plan to launch. This generates a
`Plan summary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, listing out the
activities included in the plan. Select a `Plan
Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} using the calendar popover.
This updates the `Plan summary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with
deadlines based on the intervals configured on the
`activity plan <crm/activity-plans>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Select a user in the `Assigned To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. This user is assigned to any of the activities on the plan were
configured with `Ask at launch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
the `Assignment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![The schedule activity pop-up window with an Activity plan selected.](utilize_activities/schedule-activity-plan.png){.align-center}

Click `Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The details of the plan are added to the chatter, in addition to each of
the activities.

# Expected revenue report

*Expected revenue* is the total cash value of leads that are expected to
close by a certain date, usually the end of the current month.

An *expected revenue report* compiles all active leads in a sales
pipeline that have a set expected closing date, and compares how sales
teams are performing in a given time frame.

![Close up of the expected closing date on a lead in the CRM app.](expected_revenue_report/expected-revenue-closing.png){.align-center}

By pulling a monthly expected revenue report, sales managers can see
which team members are reaching their goals, and who may need additional
assistance to close valuable deals.

## Create an expected revenue report

To create an expected revenue report, first navigate to
`CRM app --> Reporting -->
Pipeline`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. This opens the
`Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The *Pipeline Analysis* dashboard includes several filters in the search
bar by default. Remove these before adding any additional custom
filters.
::::

On the top-left of the report, click `Measures`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, then select `Expected Revenue`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu.

At the top of the page, click the
`🔻(triangle pointed down)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to
the right of the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar to
open the drop-down menu that contains `Filters`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns. Under the
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, click
`Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which opens an
`Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

### Add custom filters {#expected_revenue_report/custom-filters}

In order to generate an expected revenue report, filters need to be
created for the following conditions:

> - `Expected closing date <expected_revenue_report/closing-date>`{.interpreted-text
>   role="ref"}: limits results to only include leads expected to close
>   within a specific time frame.
> - `Exclude unassigned leads <expected_revenue_report/unassigned-leads>`{.interpreted-text
>   role="ref"}: excludes leads without an assigned salesperson.
> - `Specific sales teams <expected_revenue_report/sales-team>`{.interpreted-text
>   role="ref"}: limits results to only include leads assigned to one or
>   more sales teams. This filter is optional and should not be included
>   if the report is intended for the entire company.

#### Add filter for expected closing date {#expected_revenue_report/closing-date}

On the `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, click into the first field of the new rule. Type [Expected
Closing]{.title-ref} into the `Search...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} bar, or scroll to select it from the list. Click in the
second field and select `is set`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
This limits the results to only include leads where an estimated closing
date is listed.

Next, click the `➕ (plus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to
the right of the rule to duplicate it.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Using the `➕ (plus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon makes it
easy to add multiple rules based on the same filter.
::::

In the second field of the new rule, select
`is between`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu.
This creates a set time frame during which the expected closing date
must occur for leads to be included in the results.

Click in each date field, one at a time, and use the calendar popover
window to add both a start and end date to the rule. This is usually the
beginning and ending of the current month, or fiscal quarter.

#### Exclude unassigned leads {#expected_revenue_report/unassigned-leads}

After filtering for the expected closing date, add a
`New Rule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, click into the new
rule\'s first field, and type [Salesperson]{.title-ref} in the
`Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar, or scroll through
the list to select it. Click in the rule\'s second field and select
`is set`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu.
This excludes any results without an assigned salesperson.

#### Add a filter for sales teams {#expected_revenue_report/sales-team}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This filter is optional. To view results for the entire company, do
**not** add this filter, and continue to
`View results <expected_revenue_report/view-results>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

To limit the results of the report to one or more sales teams, click
`New Rule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Next, click the first
field for the new rule, and type [Sales Team]{.title-ref} in the
`Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar, or scroll to search
through the list to locate it.

In the rule\'s second field, select `is in`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu. Selecting this operator limits
results to the sales teams indicated in the next field.

Lastly, click into the third field, and either: make a selection from
the complete list revealed in the popover menu, or type the first few
characters of the specific sales team\'s title to quickly find and
select it as a parameter.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Multiple teams can be added to the [Sales Team]{.title-ref} rule, where
each parameter is treated with an \"or\" (e.g. \"any\") operator in the
search logic.
::::

![Add Custom Filters pop-up window with custom filters configured for expected revenue
report.](expected_revenue_report/custom-filters.png){.align-center}

## View results {#expected_revenue_report/view-results}

At the top of the `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
form, there is an option to match `any`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `all`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the
rules. In order to properly run the report, only records that match
**all** of the following filters should be included. Before adding the
filters, make sure `all`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected
in this field.

![Emphasis on the match all filters option on the Add Custom Filter pop-up window.](expected_revenue_report/match-all-filters.png){.align-center}

At the bottom of the `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} form, click `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### View options

The expected revenue report benefits from utilizing multiple views. The
default graph view can be used to identify which salespeople are
expected to bring in the most revenue, while the list view and pivot
view provide more detail on specific deals.

:::::: tabs
::: tab
Graph view

The *graph view* is used to visualize data, and is beneficial in
identifying patterns and trends.

*Bar charts* are used to show the distribution of data across several
categories or among several salespeople.

*Line charts* are useful to show changing trends over a period of time.

*Pie charts* are useful to show the distribution, or comparison, of data
among a small number of categories or salespeople, specifically how they
form the meaningful part of a whole picture.

The default view for the expected revenue report is the bar chart,
stacked. To change to a different graph view, click one of the icons at
the top-left of the report. While both the line chart and bar chart are
available in stacked view, the pie chart is not.

</figure>
:::

::: tab
List view

The *list view* provides a list of all leads that are expected to close
by the designated date. Clicking on a lead in list view opens the record
for detailed analysis, but many insights can be gleaned from the basic
view.

To switch to the list view, click the `≣ (list)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon at the top-right of the report.

![Close up of the list view icon in the CRM app.](expected_revenue_report/list-icon.png){.align-center}

To add additional metrics to the report, click the *additional options
menu* indicated by the `toggle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon
at the top-right of the list.

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="expected_revenue_report/toggle-icon.png"
alt="Close up of the toggle icon in the CRM app." />
<figcaption>Clicking the toggle icon in <em>list view</em> opens the
<em>additional options menu</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>

Select any additional metrics from the drop-down menu to add them to the
list view. Some options that may be useful are
`Expected Closing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Probability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
:::

::: tab
Pivot view

The *pivot view* arranges all leads that are expected to close by the
designated date into a dynamic table.

To switch to the pivot view, click the `Pivot`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon at the top-right of the report.

![Close up of the pivot view icon in the CRM app.](expected_revenue_report/pivot-view-icon.png){.align-center}

When the pivot view is selected for this report, the X-axis lists the
stages in the pipeline, while the Y-axis defaults to group the results
by their creation date. To switch these groupings, click the flip access
icon (`⇄`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) at the top of the report.

To add additional measures to the report, click the
`Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top-left of
the report. Select any additional metrics from the drop-down menu.

To add a group to a row or column to the pivot view, click the
`➕ (plus sign)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} next to
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and then select one of the
groups. To remove one, click the `➖ (minus sign)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and de-select the appropriate option.

Click `Insert in Spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add
the pivot view into an editable spreadsheet format within the
*Dashboards* app. If the Odoo *Documents* app is installed, the report
can be inserted into a blank or existing spreadsheet, and exported.

# Forecast report

The *Forecast* report in the *CRM* app allows users to view upcoming
opportunities and build a forecast of potential sales. Opportunities are
grouped by the month of their expected closing date, and can be
dragged-and-dropped to adjust the deadline.

To access the *Forecast* report, navigate to
`CRM app --> Reporting --> Forecast`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

## Navigate the forecast report

The default `Forecast`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report
includes opportunities assigned to the current user\'s pipeline, and are
expected to close within four months. It also shows opportunities
without an assigned expected closing date. The opportunities are grouped
by month in a `oi-view-kanban`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Kanban)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view.

![A sample version of the Forecast report in the CRM app.](forecast_report/sample-report.png){.align-center}

### Expected closing date

Opportunities are grouped by the date assigned in the *Expected Closing*
field on an opportunity form. To change this date directly from the
`Forecast`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, select the Kanban
card for the desired opportunity, then click and drag the card to the
desired column.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The default time frame for the forecast is *month*. This can be changed
by clicking the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(down)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon next to the
`Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar at the top of the
report. Under the `Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading
in the resulting drop-down menu, click
`Expected Closing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to expand the list
of available options, and select a desired amount of time from the list.
::::

After an opportunity is added to a new month, the *Expected Closing*
field on the opportunity form is updated to the *last* date of the new
month.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The *Expected Closing* field can also be manually updated on the
opportunity card. To do that, click on the Kanban card for an
opportunity on the `Forecast`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page to
open the opportunity\'s detail form. Click in the
`Expected Closing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and use the
calendar popover to select a new closing date.
::::

### Prorated revenue

The prorated revenue is the `Expected Revenue`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} amount that is displayed at the top of the column for
each month on the `Forecast`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
reporting page. This value is situated to the right of the progress bar.
The calculation for `Expected Revenue`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is the total of the prorated revenue specific to that
particular time frame.

The prorated revenue is calculated using the formula below:

$$\text{Expected Revenue} \times \text{Probability} = \text{Prorated Revenue}$$

As opportunities are moved from one column to another, the column\'s
revenue is automatically updated to reflect the change.

::: example
A forecast report for June includes two opportunities:

The first opportunity, [Global Solutions]{.title-ref}, has an expected
revenue of [\$3,800]{.title-ref}, and a probability of
[90%]{.title-ref}. This results in a prorated revenue of
[\$3,420]{.title-ref}.

The second opportunity, [Quote for 600 Chairs]{.title-ref}, has an
expected revenue of [\$22,500]{.title-ref}, and a probability of
[20%]{.title-ref}. This results in a prorated revenue of
[\$4,500]{.title-ref}.

The combined prorated revenue of the opportunities is
[\$7,920]{.title-ref}, which is listed at the top of the column for the
month.

# Pipeline Analysis

The *CRM* app manages the sales pipeline as leads/opportunities move
from stage to stage, origination to sale (**Won**) or archival
(**Lost**).

After organizing the pipeline, use the search options and reports
available on the *Pipeline Analysis* page to gain insight into the
effectiveness of the pipeline and its users.

To access the *Pipeline Analysis* page, go to
`CRM app --> Reporting --> Pipeline`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![Open the CRM app and click on the Reporting tab along the top, then click Pipeline.](win_loss/reporting-tab-and-pipeline-view.png){.align-center}

## Navigate the pipeline analysis page {#win_loss/pipeline}

Upon accessing the `Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, a bar graph showcasing the leads from the past
year automatically populates. The bars represent the number of leads in
each stage of the sales pipeline, color-coded to show the month the lead
reached that stage.

![The default state of the Pipeline Analysis page is a graph, with many options to change it.](win_loss/pipeline-analysis-page.png){.align-center}

The interactive elements of the `Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page manipulate the graph to report different metrics
in several views. From left-to-right, top-to-bottom, the elements
include:

- `Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: represented by the
  `⚙️ (gear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, located next to
  the `Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page title.
  When clicked, a drop-down menu appears with three options, each with
  their own sub-menu: `Knowledge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. (See
  `Save and share reports <win_loss/save_reports>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} for more information)
  - The `Knowledge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is for
    linking to or inserting the graph in a *Knowledge* app article.
  - The `Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is for
    adding the graph to a dashboard in the *Dashboards* app.
  - The `Spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is for
    linking the graph in a spreadsheet in the *Documents* app.
- `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar: shows the filters
  and groupings currently being applied to the graph. To add new
  filters/groups, type them into the search bar, or click the
  `⬇️ (down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, at the end
  of the bar, to open a drop-down menu of options. (See `Search Options
  <win_loss/search>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for more information)

In the upper-right corner, there are view options represented by
different icons. (See `View

  When not selected, the results in each stage are shown as individual
  bars.
- `Descending`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: re-orders the stages
  in the graph in descending order from left-to-right. Click the icon a
  second time to deselect it. Depending on the search criteria, this
  option may not be available.
- `Ascending`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: re-orders the stages
  in the graph in ascending order from left-to-right. Click the icon a
  second time to deselect it. Depending on the search criteria, this
  option may not be available.

With the pivot view selected, the following options are available:

- `Flip Axis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: flips the X and Y axis
  for the entire table.

:::
:::::::::

#### Add custom filters and groups {#win_loss/custom_filters}

In addition to the pre-made options in the search bar, the
`Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page can also
utilize custom filters and groups.

Custom filters are complex rules that further customize the search
results, while custom groups display the information in a more organized
fashion.

**To add a custom filter:**

1.  On the `Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page,
    click the `down arrow`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon next
    to the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar.
2.  In the drop-down menu, click `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.
3.  The `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
    window appears with a default rule (`Country
    is in _____`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) comprised of three
    unique fields. These fields can be edited to make a custom rule, and
    multiple rules can be added to a single custom filter.
4.  To edit a rule, start by clicking the first field
    (`Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), and select an option
    from the drop-down menu. The first field determines the primary
    subject of the rule.
5.  Next, click the second field, and select an option from the
    drop-down menu. The second field determines the relationship of the
    first and third fields, and is usually an **is** or **is not**
    statement, but can also be **greater than or less than** statements,
    and more.
6.  Finally, click the third field, and select an option from the
    drop-down menu. The third field determines the secondary subject of
    the rule.
7.  With all three fields selected, the rule is complete.
    - **To add more rules:** click `New Rule`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"} and repeat steps 4-7, as needed.
    - **To delete a rule:** click the `🗑️ (trash)`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"} icon to the right of the rule.
    - **To duplicate an existing rule:** click the
      `➕ (plus sign)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the
      right of the rule.
    - **To create more complex rules:** click the
      `Add branch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the right
      of the rule. This adds another modifier below the rule for adding
      an \"all of\" or \"any of\" statement.

![The add branch feature allows the creation of more complex all or any statements for rules.](win_loss/custom-filter-add-branch.png){.align-center}

8.  Once all rules have been added, click `Add`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} to add the custom filter to the search criteria.
    - **To remove a custom filter:** click the
      `✖️ (x)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon beside the filter
      in the search bar.

**To add a custom group:**

1.  On the `Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page,
    click the `down arrow`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon next
    to the search bar.
2.  In the drop-down menu that appears, click
    `Add Custom Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
3.  Scroll through the options in the drop-down menu, and select one or
    more groups.
    - **To remove a custom group:** click the `✖️ (x)`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"} icon beside the custom group in the search bar.

### Measurement options {#win_loss/measure}

By default, the `Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
page measures the total `Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of
leads that match the search criteria, but can be changed to measure
other items of interest.

To change the selected measurement, click the
`Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the top-left of
the page, and select one of the following options from the drop-down
menu:

- `Days to Assign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: measures the
  number of days it took a lead to be assigned after creation.
- `Days to Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: measures the
  number of days it took a lead to be closed (marked **Won**).
- `Days to Convert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: measures the
  number of days it took a lead to be converted to an opportunity.
- `Exceeded Closing Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: measures
  the number of days by which a lead exceeded its Expected Closing date.
- `Expected MRR`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: measures the
  Expected Recurring Revenue of a lead.
- `Expected Revenue`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: measures the
  Expected Revenue of a lead.
- `Prorated MRR`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: measures the
  Prorated Monthly Recurring Revenue of a lead.
- `Prorated Recurring Revenues`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  measures the Prorated Recurring Revenues of a lead.
- `Prorated Revenue`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: measures the
  Prorated Revenue of a lead.
- `Recurring Revenues`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: measures the
  Recurring Revenue of a lead.
- `Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: measures the total amount
  of leads that match the search criteria.

### View options {#win_loss/view}

After configuring filters, groupings, and measurements, the
`Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page can display
the data in a variety of ways. By default, the page uses the graph view,
but can be changed to a pivot view, cohort view, or list view.

To change the pipeline to a different view, click one of the four view
icons, located in the top-right of the
`Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.

::::::::::::: tabs
::::: tab
Graph View

The graph view is the default selection for the
`Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page. It displays
the analysis as either a: bar chart, line chart, or pie chart.

This view option is useful for quickly visualizing and comparing simple
relationships, like the `Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of
leads in each stage, or the leads assigned to each
`Salesperson`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

By default, the graph measures the `Count`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of leads in each group, but this can be changed by
clicking the `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and
`selecting another option
<win_loss/measure>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} from the resulting
drop-down menu.

![The Graph View displays the analysis as a Bar Chart, Line Chart, or Pie Chart.](win_loss/graph-view.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

When using a bar chart in this view, consider deselecting the
`Stacked`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, in order to make
the breakdown of results more legible.
::::
:::::

::::: tab
Pivot View

The pivot view displays the results of the analysis as a table. By
default, the table groups the results by the stages of the sales
pipeline, and measures `Expected Revenue`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

The pivot view is useful for analyzing more detailed numbers than the
graph view can handle, or for adding the data to a spreadsheet, where
custom formulas can be set up, like in an Excel file.

![The Pivot View displays the analysis as a table.](win_loss/pivot-view.png){.align-center}

The three icons at the top-left of the page perform the following
functions:

- `Flip Axis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: flips the X and Y axis
  for the entire table.
- `Expand All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: when additional
  groupings are selected using the `➕ (plus
  sign)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icons, this button opens
  those groupings under every row.
- `Download xlsx`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: downloads the
  table as an Excel file.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} grouping cannot be
removed, but the measurement can be changed by clicking the
`Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and selecting
another option.
::::
:::::

::: tab
Cohort View

The cohort view displays the analysis as periods of time (cohorts) that
can be set to days, weeks, months, or years. By default,
`Week`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected.

This view option is useful specifically for comparing how long it has
taken to close leads.

![The Cohort View displays the analysis as individual weeks of the year.](win_loss/cohort-view.png){.align-center}

From left-to-right, top-to-bottom, the columns in the chart represent
the following:

- `Created On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: rows in this column
  represent the weeks of the year, in which records matching the search
  criteria exist.
  - When set to `Week`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a row with
    the label `W52 2023`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} means the
    results occurred in: Week 52 of the Year 2023.
- `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the second column in
  the chart is the measurement of the results. By default, it is set to
  `Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, but can be changed by
  clicking the `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and
  selecting an option from the drop-down menu.
- `Closed Date - By Day/Week/Month/Year`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: this column looks at what percentage of the measured
  results were closed in subsequent days/weeks/months/years.
- `Average`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this row provides the
  average of all other rows in the column.

The cohort view can also be downloaded as an Excel file, by clicking the
`Download`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the top-left of
the page.
:::

::::: tab
List View

The list view displays a single list of all leads matching the search
criteria. Clicking a lead opens the record for closer review. Additional
details such as `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Medium`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and more can be added to
the list, by clicking the `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon in the top-right of the list.

This view option is useful for reviewing many records at once.

![The List View displays a single list of all records matching the search criteria.](win_loss/list-view.png){.align-center}

Clicking the `⚙️ (gear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon opens
the Actions drop-down menu, with options for the following:

- `Import records`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: opens a page for
  uploading a spreadsheet of data, as well as a template spreadsheet to
  easily format that data.
- `Export All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: downloads the list as
  an xlsx file for Excel.
- `Knowledge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: inserts a view of, or
  link to, the list in an article in the *Knowledge* app.
- `Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: adds the list to *My
  Dashboard* in the *Dashboards* app.
- `Spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: links to, or
  inserts, the list in a spreadsheet in the *Documents* app.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

On the list view, clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
closes the list, and opens the *New Quotation* page. Clicking
`Generate Leads`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} opens a pop-up
window for lead generation. Neither feature is intended to manipulate
the list view.

## Create reports {#win_loss/reports}

After understanding how to
`navigate the pipeline analysis page <win_loss/pipeline>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, the `Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
page can be used to create and share different reports. Between the
pre-made options and custom filter and groupings, almost any combination
is possible.

Once created, reports can be
`saved to favorites, shared with other users, and/or added to
dashboards and spreadsheets <win_loss/save_reports>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

A few common reports that can be created using the
`Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page are detailed
below.

### Win/Loss reports {#win_loss/win_loss}

Win/Loss is a calculation of active or previously active leads in a
pipeline that were either marked as **Won** or **Lost** over a specific
period of time. By calculating opportunities won over opportunities
lost, teams can clarify key performance indicators (KPIs) that are
converting leads into sales, such as specific teams or team members,
certain marketing mediums or campaigns, and so on.

$$\begin{equation}
Win/Loss Ratio = \frac{Opportunities Won}{Opportunities Lost}
\end{equation}$$

A win/loss report filters the leads from the past year, whether won or
lost, and groups the results by their stage in the pipeline. Creating
this report requires a custom filter, and grouping the results by
`Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The search criteria for win/loss reports is Created On, Stage, and Active is in true false.](win_loss/search-criteria-for-basic-win-loss.png){.align-center}

Follow the steps below to create a win/loss report:

1.  Navigate to `CRM app --> Reporting --> Pipeline`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.

2.  On the `Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page,
    click the `⬇️ (down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon,
    next to the search bar, to open a drop-down menu of filters and
    groupings.

    ![The Search menu containing the filters for a basic win/loss report.](win_loss/filters-for-basic-win-loss-report.png){.align-center}

3.  In drop-down menu that appears, under the
    `Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading, click
    `Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

4.  Under the `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading,
    click `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open
    another pop-up menu.

5.  In the `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
    menu, click on the first field in the
    `Match any of the following rules:`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} section. By default, this field displays
    `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

6.  Clicking that first field reveals a sub-menu with numerous options
    to choose from. From this sub-menu, locate and select the
    `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. Doing so
    automatically populates the remaining fields.

    The first field reads: `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
    The second field reads: `is`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. And
    lastly, the third field reads: `set`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

    In total, the rule reads: `Active is set`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

7.  Click `New Rule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, change the
    first field to `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
    last field to `not set`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In
    total, the rule reads `Active is not set`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

8.  Click `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Add Custom Filter menu showing two rules: (1) Active is set, and (2) Active is not set.](win_loss/add-custom-active-filter.png){.align-center}

The report now displays the total `Count`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of leads, whether \"Won\" or \"Lost,\" grouped by their
stage in the CRM pipeline. Hover over a section of the report to see the
number of leads in that stage.

![A basic win/loss report showing all leads whether won or lost grouped by stage.](win_loss/basic-win-loss-report.png){.align-center}

#### Customize win/loss reports

After `creating a win/loss report <win_loss/win_loss>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, consider using the options below to customize the report
for different needs.

::: example
A sales manager might group wins and losses by salesperson, or sales
team, to see who has the best conversion rate. Or, a marketing team
might group by sources, or medium, to determine where their advertising
has been most successful.

`⬇️ (down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, next to the
search bar, and select one or more options from the drop-down menu.

Some useful options include:

- `Created on`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: adjusting this filter
  to a different period of time, such as the last 30 days, or the last
  quarter, can provide more timely results.
- `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: clicking this
  option, and scrolling through the numerous options in the drop-down
  menu, opens up additional search criteria, like `Last
  Stage Update`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Lost Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Add Custom Group > Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  Clicking `Add Custom Group --> Active`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"} separates the results into **Won**
  (`true`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) or **Lost**
  (`false`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}). This shows at what stage
  leads are being marked **Won** or **Lost**.
- `Multiple Groupings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: add multiple
  `Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} selections to split
  results into more relevant and manageable chunks.
  - Adding `Salesperson`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `Sales Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} breaks up the total
    count of leads in each `Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  - Adding `Medium`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can reveal what
    marketing avenues generate more sales.

Pivot View

By default, pivot view groups win/loss reports by
`Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and measures
`Expected Revenue`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To flesh out the table:

1.  Click the `⬇️ (down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} next
    to the search bar.
2.  In the pop-up menu, replace the `Stage`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} grouping with something like
    `Salesperson`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `Medium`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
3.  Click the `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and
    click `Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add the number
    of leads back into the report.
    - Other useful measures for pivot view include
      `Days to Assign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
      `Days to Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To re-order the nesting, remove all `Group By`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} options and re-add them in the desired order.

To add more columns to the list:

1.  Click the `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
    top-right of the page.
2.  Select options from the resulting drop-down menu. Some useful
    filters include:

# Lost opportunities

Not every opportunity results in a successful sale. To keep the pipeline
up-to-date, *lost* opportunities need to be identified. Specifying why
an opportunity was lost helps identify recurring issues, reveal coaching
opportunities, and can assist with improving overall sales strategy.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`Merging lost opportunities <merge_similar>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} with active ones will pull them back into the pipeline.
::::

## Mark an opportunity as lost

To mark an opportunity as lost, first open the
`CRM app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and then select an
opportunity from the pipeline by clicking on its corresponding Kanban
card. Doing so reveals that opportunity\'s detail form.

Then, click `Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, located at the
top of the opportunity\'s detail form.

![Buttons from the top of an opportunity record with the lost button emphasized.](lost_opportunities/lost-opps-lost-button.png)

This opens the `Mark Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window. From the `Lost Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down menu, choose an existing lost reason. If no applicable reason
is available, then create a new one by entering it into the
`Lost Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and then
clicking `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Additional notes and comments can be added below the lost reason in the
designated `Closing Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Neither the `Lost Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, nor
the `Closing Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, on the
`Mark Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window are
required. However, it is recommended to include this information for the
sake of traceability, accountability, and reporting purposes.
::::

When all the desired information has been entered in the
`Mark Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, click
`Mark as Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Lost reasons popup with sample reasons.](lost_opportunities/lost-opps-lost-reason.png)

After clicking `Mark as Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a red
`Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner is added to the
upper-right corner of the opportunity.

![A lost opportunity with the lost banner added.](lost_opportunities/lost-banner.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To mark an *inactive* (archived) opportunity as lost, set the
`Probability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
[0]{.title-ref} percent.
::::

## Create/edit lost reasons {#crm/lost-reasons}

To create a new lost reason, or edit an existing one, navigate to
`CRM app -->
Configuration --> Lost Reasons`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

To edit an existing lost reason, click the reason to be edited to
highlight it. From here, change the selected lost reason by editing the
`Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

To create a new lost reason, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the upper-left corner of the `Lost
Reasons`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page. Then, type the new
lost reason in the `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

## View lost opportunities

To retrieve lost opportunities, go
`CRM app --> Sales --> My Pipeline`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then click on the search bar at the top of the
page, and then remove all of the default filters.

![Search bar with lost filter emphasized.](lost_opportunities/lost-opps-lost-filter.png)

Open the `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu by
clicking the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(dropdown)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the right of the
search bar to open the drop-down menu containing
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options, designated into
respective columns.

Select the `Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option from the
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Upon selecting
`Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, only the opportunities marked
as [Lost]{.title-ref} appear on the `Pipeline`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page.

### Sort opportunities by lost reason

To filter opportunities by a specific lost reason, click the
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(dropdown)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the right of the
search bar again to open the drop-down menu. In addition to the
`Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter, under the
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, click `Add
Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which opens an
`Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

On the `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, click in the first field and type [Lost Reason]{.title-ref} in
the search bar, or scroll to search through the list to locate it. Then,
click into the next field, and select `=`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu. Click into the third field,
and then select a lost reason from the drop-down menu. Finally, click
`Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Search bar with custom filter added for lost reason.](lost_opportunities/lost-opps-lost-custom-filter.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To view results for more than one lost reason, select the operator
`is in`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the second field of the
custom filter in the `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window. Choosing this operator makes it possible
to choose multiple lost reasons in the third field.

![Add Custom Filter pop-up with multiple lost reasons selected.](lost_opportunities/multiple-lost-reasons.png)
::::

## Restore lost opportunities

To restore a lost opportunity, open the `CRM`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} app to reveal the `Pipeline`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard. Or, navigate to
`CRM app --> Sales --> My Pipeline`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. From here, click the
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(dropdown)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the right of the
search bar to open the drop-down menu that contains
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns.

Under the `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, select
`Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so reveals all the lost
opportunities on the `Pipeline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To see all opportunities in the database, remove the default
`My Pipeline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter from the search
bar.
::::

From the lost opportunity\'s detail form, click
`Restore`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the upper-left corner.
Doing so removes the red `Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
banner from the opportunity form, signifying the opportunity has been
restored.

![Lost opportunity with emphasis on the Restore button.](lost_opportunities/lost-opps-restore.png)

### Restore multiple opportunities at once

To restore multiple opportunities at once, open the dashboard mega menu
by clicking the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(dropdown)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon (to the right of
the search bar) and select the default `Lost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option located under the left-side
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

Next, select the list view option, represented by the
`fa-bars`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(list)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon in the upper-right corner. Doing so places all the
opportunities from the `Pipeline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
page in a list view. With the list view chosen, select the checkbox to
the left of each opportunity to be restored.

Once the desired opportunities have been selected, click the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu at the top of the
`Pipeline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page. From the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Actions)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu, select `Unarchive`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Doing so removes those selected opportunities from the
`Pipeline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page because they no
longer fit the `Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter
criteria. Delete the `Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter
from the search bar to reveal these newly-restored opportunities.

![Action button from list view with the Unarchive option emphasized.](lost_opportunities/lost-opps-unarchive.png)

## Manage lost leads

If *Leads* are enabled on a database, then they can be marked as *lost*
in the same manner as opportunities. Leads use the same
`lost reasons <crm/lost-reasons>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} as
opportunities.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To enable leads, navigate to
`CRM app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and check the `Leads`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox. This adds a new `Leads`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} menu to the header menu bar at the top of the page.
::::

### Mark a lead as lost

To mark a lead as lost, navigate to
`CRM app --> Leads`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select
a lead from the list. Doing so reveals that lead\'s detail form. Then,
click `Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, located at the top of
the lead\'s detail form.

This opens the `Mark Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window. From the `Lost Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down menu, choose an existing lost reason. If no applicable reason
is available, then create a new one by entering it into the
`Lost Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and selecting
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Additional notes and comments can be added below the lost reason
designated in the `Closing Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

When all the desired information has been entered in the
`Mark Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, click
`Mark as Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Restore lost leads

To restore a lost lead, navigate to
`CRM app --> Leads`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and then
click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(dropdown)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the right of the
search bar to open the drop-down menu that contains the
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns.

Under the `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, select
`Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so reveals all the lost
leads on the `Leads`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.

Then, click on the desired lost lead to restore, which opens that
lead\'s detail form.

From the lost lead\'s detail form, click `Restore`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the upper-left corner. Doing so removes the red
`Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner from the lead form,
signifying the lead has been restored.

### Restore multiple leads at once

To restore multiple leads at once, navigate to
`CRM app --> Leads`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, open the
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu, and select
the `Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. Select the
checkbox to the left of each lead to be restored.

Once the desired leads have been selected, click the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Actions)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu at the top of the
`Leads`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page. From the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Actions)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu, select `Unarchive`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Doing so removes those selected leads from the `Leads`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page because they no longer fit the
`Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter criteria. Delete the
`Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter from the search bar to
reveal these newly-restored leads.

# Merge similar leads and opportunities

Odoo automatically detects similar *leads* and *opportunities* within
the *CRM* app. Identifying these duplicated records allows them to be
merged without losing any information in the process. Not only does this
help keep the *pipeline* organized, but it also prevents customers from
being contacted by more than one salesperson.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When merging opportunities, no information is lost. Data from the other
opportunity is logged in the chatter, and the information fields, for
reference.
::::

## Identify similar leads and opportunities

Similar leads and opportunities are identified by comparing the *email
address* and *phone number* of the associated contact. If a similar
lead/opportunity is found, a *Similar Leads* smart button appears at the
top of the lead (or opportunity) record.

![An opportunity record with emphasis on the Similar Leads smart button.](merge_similar/similar-smart-button.png){.align-center}

### Comparing similar leads and opportunities

To compare the details of similar leads/opportunities, navigate to
`CRM app -->
Pipeline`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} or
`CRM app --> Leads`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Open a lead
or opportunity, and click the `Similar Leads`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button. Doing so opens a Kanban view that only
displays similar leads/opportunities. Click on a card to view the
details for the lead/opportunity, and confirm if they should be merged.

## Merging similar leads and opportunities

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When merging, Odoo gives priority to whichever lead/opportunity was
created in the system first, merging the information into the first
created lead/opportunity. However, if a lead and an opportunity are
being merged, the resulting record is referred to as an opportunity,
regardless of which record was created first.
::::

After confirming that the leads/opportunities should be merged, return
to the Kanban view using the breadcrumb link, or by clicking the
`Similar Leads`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button. Click
the `oi-view-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(list)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to change to list view.

Check the box on the left of the page for the leads/opportunities to be
merged. Then, click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon at the top of the
page, to reveal a drop-down menu. From that drop-down menu, select the
`Merge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option to merge the selected
opportunities or leads.

When `Merge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected from the

::: title
Danger
:::

Merging is an irreversible action. Do **not** merge leads/opportunities
unless absolutely certain they should be combined.
::::

## When leads/opportunities should not be merged

There may be instances where a similar lead or opportunity is
identified, but should *not* be merged. These circumstances vary, based
on the processes of the sales team and organization. Some potential
scenarios are listed below.

### Lost leads

If a lead/opportunity has been marked as
`lost <lost_opportunities>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, it can still
be merged with an active lead or opportunity. The resulting
lead/opportunity is marked active, and added to the pipeline.

### Different contact within an organization

Leads/opportunities from the same organization, but with different
points of contact, may not have the same needs. In this case, it is
beneficial to *not* merge these records, though assigning the same
salesperson, or sales team, can prevent duplicated work and
miscommunication.

### Existing duplicates with more than one salesperson

If more than one lead/opportunity exists in the database, there may be
multiple salespeople assigned to them, who are actively working on them
independently. While these leads/opportunities may need to be managed
separately, it is recommended that any affected salespeople be tagged in
an internal note for visibility.

### Contact information is similar but not exact

Similar leads and opportunities are identified by comparing the email
addresses and phone numbers of the associated contacts. However, if the
email address is *similar*, but not *exact*, they may need to remain
independent.

::: example
Three different leads were added to the pipeline and assigned to
different salespeople. They were identified as *Similar Leads* due to
the email addresses of the contacts.

Two of the leads appear to come from the same individual,
[Robin]{.title-ref}, and have identical email addresses. These leads
should be merged.

The third lead has the same email domain, but the address is different,
as is the contact name. While this lead is most likely from the same
organization, it is from a different contact, and should **not** be
merged.

# Lead distribution report

A *lead distribution report* can be used to see if active leads are
being assigned equitably across sales members. It can also be used to
view the distribution of good or `quality leads
<quality_leads_report>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, and see how
frequently each salesperson is receiving (and keeping) leads.

Lead distribution reports can be run each week to help keep salespeople
on track, while providing them with ample good leads. These reports can
also be used to see whether sales members are staying productive, if
good leads are being lost too often by one salesperson, and what
percentage of good leads are being retained overall.

## Create lead distribution reports

To create a lead distribution report, first navigate to
`CRM app --> Reporting -->
Pipeline`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, which reveals the
`Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

Remove all the default filters in the search bar at the top of the page.
Doing so displays data related to *all* leads.

`Custom filters <search/custom-filters>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
can now be added by clicking the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(down caret)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, to
the right of the search bar, to reveal a drop-down menu of search and
filter options.

Three columns are displayed:
`Filters <search/filters>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`Group By <search/group>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
`Favorites <search/favorites>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. To begin,
navigate to the bottom of the `Filters`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column, and click `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. This opens an `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window, where the essential filters can be added
one at a time.

### Essential filters {#crm/track_leads/essential-filters}

The following filter conditions are used to create a basic lead
distribution report. Together they gather all leads created within a
certain timespan that have an associated contact method and have been
assigned to a sales team.

#### Lead creation date

Click the first field, under
`Match any of the following rules:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
that has the value `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in it.
In the popover that appears, type [Created on]{.title-ref} in the search
bar, or scroll to search through the list to locate and select it.

Then, in the second field of that row, select `>=`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu. This operator **only**
includes values greater than (or equal to) the value in the third,
rightmost field.

The third field on the `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window should contain the earliest date leads
are selected from.

For example, setting [01/01/2024 00:00:00]{.title-ref} only includes
leads created from, and including, the first day of 2024.

![Add a Created On rule for the start of the year onward.](lead_distribution_report/created-on.png){.align-center}

#### Sales team {#crm/track_leads/sales-team}

Click `New rule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add another row
to the form, and choose `Sales Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
for this rule\'s parameter. Then, click the second field of the new
rule, and select `contains`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
drop-down menu. Selecting this operator filters for any records that
contain the words in the third, rightmost field.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

For certain pre-determined, limited choices like a sales team, the
`is in`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} operator helps make for an
easier and more accurate selection, via a drop-down menu in the third
field, instead of risking a typo or incorrect value in the text box
field that accompanies the `contains`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
operator.
::::

In this third field, enter the name of the desired sales team(s) that
are to be included in the report. It is important for all
`contains`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} argument values to be
specific enough and spelled correctly as they exist in Odoo, otherwise
this risks returning multiple (or zero) values.

![Use Sales Team to filter the location the lead is associated with.](lead_distribution_report/sales-team-location.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

By adding more than one rule to the form, a new option emerges at the
top of the pop-up window above all the filters, to specify whether
`any`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} or
`all`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} of the conditions should
match. This distinction is important to set correctly, as it impacts the
driving logic of how the filters return data.
::::

Click the default `any`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} menu item and be sure the
`all`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} option is chosen instead.
This setting will **only** show records that match *all* the rules
contained inside the form.

#### Contact method {#crm/track_leads/phone-number}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The instruction below is not necessary, however, it\'s highly
recommended to add a set contact value to the report\'s search criteria.
A lot of spam, duplicate, or low quality leads can easily be screened
out of the report simply by adding either a set
`Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Email`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} rule.
::::

Add another `New rule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the form
and set the first field to the first field to `Phone`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, select `is set`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu in the second field. Selecting
this operator **only** filters for records that have a phone number
associated with the lead.

Alternatively (or in addition to the above rule), click
`New rule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and set the first field to
`Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, select
`is set`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu in
the second field.

These rules add only leads with an associated contact method to the
report.

#### Active status {#crm/track_leads/active-status}

Click the `fa-sitemap`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Add branch)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the right of
the [Phone is set]{.title-ref} line, to add a new rule that branches
from the rules above.

Two horizontal sets of fields appear below a line showing
`any`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `of:`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option. This setting filters for records that match
**any** of the rules contained inside. This uses the same logic as an OR
([\|]{.title-ref}) logical operator.

Set the first field to `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Then, select `is set`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the next
field.

Next, click the `fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Add New Rule)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to
`Active is set`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a new line
of fields beneath it.

Set the first field to `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Then, select `is not set`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the next
field.

![Use Active to include active status in the report.](lead_distribution_report/active-set.png){.align-center}

This rule adds the activity status of the lead to the report.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Active status is an important filter to include when creating a lead
distribution report because it includes **all** leads regardless of
won/lost or active/inactive status in the report. This provides a
comprehensive view of all the leads assigned to each sales member.
::::

#### Group by

Once all filters are set, click the `Add`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to add these filters to the search bar. To have
the report grouped appropriately, click the
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(down caret)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, to the right of
the search bar, and click `Salesperson`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `Group
By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. All results are now
grouped by the salesperson assigned to each lead.

Once the rules for the filter are set, click the purple
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the bottom of the
pop-up menu to save the custom filter and close the pop-up menu.

The `Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard is
now displayed again with each filter rule in the search bar.

Click the `fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Graph)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, to the right of the
search bar, to view the report as a bar chart. Alternatively, click the
`oi-view-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(List)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon to view leads in a grouped list.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To save the filter so it can easily be re-applied, click the
`Save current search`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
`Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the search bar
drop-down menu.

Next, type a name for the filter in the text box below. Check the
`Shared`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox to have the filter
shared with any user with access to the pipeline. Finally, click the
purple `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button below to save
the filter.

The filter will now appear with the name it was given under the
`Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the drop-down
menu and can be re-applied by clicking on it.
::::

### Filter for quality leads

The following additional conditions are provided as an example of a
*good*, but *not comprehensive*, set of rules for finding quality leads.
These filters should be applied on top of the
`crm/track_leads/essential-filters`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} in the
order specified to achieve a heavily-detailed filter.

- **Referred-by:** Filter for referrals, such as by appointment or sales
  member.
- **Source:** Filter for specific source UTMs, such as Facebook or
  LinkedIn.
- **Notes:** Filter for internal notes.
- **Tags:** Filter for categorical tags.
- **Email:** Filter for specific email domains, such as gmail.com or
  yahoo.com.
- **Salesperson:** Filter for leads associated with certain sales
  members.

These conditions can be added, removed, or modified to best fit the
desired information in the report.

# Assign leads with predictive lead scoring

The Odoo **CRM** app can automatically assign leads/opportunities to
sales teams and salespeople. A standard practice is to assign leads
based on the probability of winning each lead. Companies can prioritize
the leads that are more likely to result in successful deals by quickly
assigning them to the appropriate salespeople.

Odoo automatically calculates the probability of winning each lead using
a method called *predictive lead scoring*.

## Predictive lead scoring

Predictive lead scoring is a machine-learning model that uses historical
data from Odoo **CRM** to score open leads/opportunities.

As a company processes opportunities through the CRM pipeline, Odoo
collects data on which opportunities are won and lost. Predictive lead
scoring uses this data to predict the probability of winning each new
lead or opportunity.

The more opportunities that are sent through the CRM pipeline, the more
data Odoo collects, resulting in more accurate probabilities.

Specifically, Odoo\'s predictive lead scoring uses the *naive Bayes*
probability model:

$$\begin{equation}
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A) \times P(B | A)}{P(B)}
\end{equation}$$

Breaking down the equation:

- P(A\|B) = The probability of a successful lead *in this case*
- P(A) = The overall probability of a lead being successful regardless
  of the conditions
- P(B\|A) = The probability of this being the case given a lead is
  successful
- P(B) = The probability of this being the case

The term *in this case* refers to the variables that can affect a lead
being successful in Odoo. This can include variables such as the
assigned Salesperson, the source of the lead, the language of the lead,
and other historical and demographic data.

Which variables are considered in this calculation can be `configured
<lead_scoring/configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to tailor
the calculation to each business\'s needs.

The probability of success of each opportunity is displayed on the
opportunity form, and it updates automatically as the opportunity
progresses through the CRM pipeline.

![The probability of success displayed on the opportunity form.](lead_scoring/probability-opportunity-form.png)

When an opportunity moves to the next stage, its probability of success
automatically increases according to the predictive lead scoring
algorithm.

### Configuration {#lead_scoring/configuration}

Predictive lead scoring is always active in Odoo **CRM**. However, the
variables used to calculate the probability of success can be customized
in the settings.

To customize the variables used by predictive lead scoring, go to
`CRM -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Under `Predictive Lead Scoring`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
click on the `Update Probabilities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button.

Then, click on the drop-down menu to choose which variables the
predictive lead scoring feature takes into account.

![The Update Probabilities window in the Predictive Lead Scoring settings.](lead_scoring/update-probabilities.png)

Any number of the following variables can be activated:

- `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the geographical state
  from which the opportunity originates
- `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the geographical country
  from which the opportunity originates
- `Phone Quality`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: whether or not a
  phone number is listed for the opportunity
- `Email Quality`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: whether or not an
  email address is listed for the opportunity
- `Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the source of an
  opportunity (e.g. search engine, social media)
- `Language`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the spoken language
  specified on the opportunity
- `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the tags placed on the
  opportunity

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The variables [Stage]{.title-ref} and [Team]{.title-ref} are always in
effect. [Stage]{.title-ref} refers to the CRM pipeline stage that an
opportunity is in. [Team]{.title-ref} refers to the sales team that is
assigned to an opportunity. Predictive lead scoring *always* takes into
account these two variables, regardless of which optional variables are
selected.
::::

Next, click on the date field next to the option
`Consider leads created as of the:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to select the date from which predictive lead scoring begins its
calculations.

Lastly, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save
changes.

### Change the probability manually

An opportunity\'s probability of success can be changed manually on the
opportunity form. Click on the probability number to edit it.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Manually changing the probability removes the automatic probability
updates for that opportunity. The probability no longer automatically
updates as the opportunity moves through each stage of the pipeline.
::::

To reactivate automatic probability, click on the gear icon next to the
probability percentage.

![The gear icon used to reactivate automatic probability on an opportunity form.](lead_scoring/probability-gear-icon.png)

## Assign leads based on probability

Odoo **CRM** can assign leads/opportunities to sales teams and
salespeople based on specified rules. Create assignment rules based on
the leads\' probability of success to prioritize those that are more
likely to result in leads and opportunities.

### Configure rule-based assignment

To activate *rule-based assignment*, navigate to
`CRM --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and activate
`Rule-Based Assignment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The rule-based assignment feature can be set to run
`Manually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, meaning an Odoo user must
manually trigger the assignment, or `Repeatedly`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, meaning Odoo automatically triggers the assignment
according to the chosen time period.

To configure automatic lead assignment, select
`Repeatedly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
`Running`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. The frequency of
this automatic assignment is customized within the `Repeat
every`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Enter a specific
number and select a corresponding time period to establish the desired
interval. Time periods range from `Minutes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to `Weeks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Rule-Based Assignment setting in CRM settings.](lead_scoring/rule-based-assignment.png)

If `rule-based assignment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
run `Repeatedly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the assignment can
still be triggered manually using the circular arrow icon in the
`Rule-Based Assignment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} settings, or
using the `Assign Leads`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on
the sales team configuration page. Once a lead has been assigned to a
salesperson via this rule, the leads are automatically converted into an
opportunity by the system.

### Configure assignment rules

Next, configure the *assignment rules* for each sales team or
salesperson. These rules determine which leads Odoo assigns to which
people. To get started, navigate to `CRM -->
Configuration --> Sales Teams`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and select a sales team.

On the sales team configuration form, under
`Assignment Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click on `Edit
Domain`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to configure the rules that
Odoo uses to determine lead assignment for this sales team. The rules
can include anything that may be relevant for this company or team, and
any number of rules can be added.

Click `Add Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to start creating
assignment rules. Click on the `fa-plus-circle`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} sign on the right of the assignment rule to add another
line. Click on the `x`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} symbol to
remove the line.

To create an assignment rule based on an opportunity\'s probability of
success, click on the far left drop-down menu of an assignment rule
line, and select `Probability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

From the middle drop-down menu, select the desired equation
symbol---most likely the symbol for *greater than*, *less than*,
*greater than or equal to*, or *less than or equal to*.

In the far right space, enter the desired number value of the
probability. Finally, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
save changes.

::: example
To configure an assignment rule such that a sales team receives leads
that have a probability of success of 20% or greater, create a
`Domain`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line that reads:
[Probability \>= 20]{.title-ref}.

![Sales team domain set to probability greater than or equal to twenty percent.](lead_scoring/probability-domain.png)
:::

Separate assignment rules can also be configured for individual team
members. From the sales team configuration page, click on a team member
in the `Members`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, then edit the
`Domain`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save changes.

If automatic lead assignment is configured in the settings, both the
sales team and individual team members have the option to
`Skip auto assignment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Check this
box to omit a particular sales team or salesperson from being assigned
leads automatically by Odoo\'s rule-based assignment feature. If
`Skip auto assignment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is activated,
the sales team or salesperson can still be assigned leads manually.

To manually assign leads to this sales team, click on the
`Assign Leads`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top of
the sales team configuration page. This assigns any leads that are
currently unassigned and match this team\'s specified domain.

# Marketing attribution reports

Use the Odoo *CRM* app to compile a *marketing attribution report*,
which analyzes the source of leads, and groups them in such a way as to
calculate marketing\'s overall impact on lead generation, attribution,
won rate, and more.

## Leads Analysis dashboard

Begin by navigating to the `Leads Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard by going to `CRM app
--> Reporting --> Leads`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Reports can also be run on the `CRM app --> Leads`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} dashboard, which is **only** accessible if the
*Leads* feature has been activated on the *Settings* page.

If the *Leads* feature has **not** been activated, the
`CRM app --> Sales --> My
Pipeline`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} dashboard can also be
used to run reports.

Both dashboards contain the necessary *Filters* and *Group By* criteria
to run an attribution report.

The `fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(graph)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view is shown, by default,
with `Active or
Inactive`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Created on: [current year]`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filters
active in the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar. The
graph visualization displays the number of leads generated, by month and
by sales team, with each sales team attributed to its own color per
month shown.

Switch the view to the `oi-view-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(list)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, by clicking the
respective icon located at the top-right of the dashboard. This allows
leads to easily be displayed in the grouping set by the *Group By*
parameters.

![Click the button with four horizontal lines on the top right of the Leads Analysis page.](marketing_attribution/list-view-button.png){.align-center}

## Add UTM parameters

*Urchin Tracking Modules (UTMs)* are snippets of text embedded in URLs
that are used to track visitor data. This includes parameters relating
to how a visitor reached the link, such as the type of website visited,
and/or marketing campaign the visit came from.

Odoo can use these UTMs as parameters in the marketing attribution
report to track the metrics and performance of marketing campaigns.

### Create UTMs

The
`link tracker <../../../websites/website/reporting/link_tracker>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} in Odoo can be used to create and configure UTMs.

UTMs can also be automatically generated by the `Email Marketing
<../../../marketing/email_marketing>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
`Marketing Automation
<../../../marketing/marketing_automation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
apps.

The UTM parameters used in a marketing attribution report are *Medium*,
*Source*, and *Campaign*, in descending order of coverage.

- *Medium* is the UTM with the widest coverage, and is used to identify
  the medium used to access the link. This can include mediums such as
  social media, email, or cost per click (CPC).
- *Source* is more narrow, and is used to identify the source of
  traffic. For example, the name of a website, search engine used, or a
  specific social media platform.
- *Campaign* is the most narrow, and can track specific marketing
  campaigns by name. This can include a contest or product name, type of
  sale, etc.

## Create reports

To start creating a report, click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the
right of the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar to see
the list of filtering and grouping parameters.

`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, located in the left column
of the search options, can be used to keep only the results that fit the
filter. For example, selecting the `Won`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} filter only shows leads that have been won in the
attribution report.

`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, found in the middle
column, is used to organize the results into groups, and can be used
with or without filters.

![Select any number of filters and groups in the search options.](marketing_attribution/search-results-multiple-options.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Setting multiple `Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options
creates nested groups, according to which option is selected first. For
example, selecting `Medium`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, followed
by `Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and then
`Campaign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, in
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, sorts all results
*first* by medium, *then* by the specific sources in each medium,
followed by the campaigns in each source.

This can be verified by looking at the direction, and order, of the
selections in the group tile that appears in the
`Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar.

![The text in the tile is \`Country \> City\`, showing that city is a subgroup of country.](marketing_attribution/group-by.png){.align-center}
::::

::: example
For a useful first report:

#\. From the `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, select
the `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter to view only
leads that are still marked as active. #. From the
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, select (in this
specific order) `Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, followed by
the `City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, depending on which
grouping is more relevant.

![Each lead is now sorted by source, followed by city or country.](marketing_attribution/campaign-and-country-groups.png){.align-center}

This report contains all active leads, grouped first by the source of
the lead, then by the city or country each lead is from. This is useful
to see the density of active opportunities sorted by location.

With this data, marketing campaigns, such as conferences or billboards,
can be targeted to the locations generating the largest amount of
potential revenue. Similarly, more attention can be put toward
increasing outreach in locations where existing marketing campaigns are
less effective.

# Quality leads report

A *quality lead* is a lead that is likely to result in a sale. It should
match the characteristics most commonly believed to help salespeople
close a deal, in addition to more precise criteria that is specific to
each organization.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The specific criteria that defines a *quality lead* is different for
every organization. For more information, see
`Define a quality lead <track_links/define-a-lead>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

A quality leads *report* compares how many quality leads each
salesperson has received over a specific amount of time, such as within
the past 30 days. Sales managers can use such a report to make more
informed decisions when assigning new leads to their team

::: example
A sales manager pulls a quality leads report using their company\'s
criteria:

- Leads must include a phone number and an email address.
- The email address must be from a professional domain.
- The source for the lead must be from a live chat conversation or an
  appointment with a salesperson.

After running the report, the manager can see that, although everyone\'s
ability to close a deal has varied, some members of the sales team have
received a higher number of quality leads than others.

![An example of a quality leads report in the Odoo CRM application.](quality_leads_report/example-report.png){.align-center}

Using this information, the sales manager may decide to assign more
quality leads to the sales people currently on the lower end, to balance
out the distribution of quality leads.
:::

## Create a quality leads report {#track_links/create-quality-leads-report}

To create a quality leads report, first navigate to
`CRM app --> Reporting -->
Pipeline`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} to open the
`Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard. Click
into the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar at the top
of the page and remove any active filters.

Click the `🔻(triangle pointed down)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon to the right of the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
bar to open the drop-down mega menu that contains
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns. Click
`Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This opens a
`Add
Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

The `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
allows for the creation of more specific filters.

### Add custom filters

In order to generate a quality leads report, filters need to be created
for the following conditions:

- `Starting date <quality_leads_report/starting-date>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: limits results to those created within a specific time
  frame.
- `Specific sales teams <quality_leads_report/sales-team>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: limits results to only include leads for one or more
  sales teams. This filter is optional and should not be included if the
  is intended for the entire company.
- `Exclude unassigned leads <quality_leads_report/unassigned-leads>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: excludes leads without an assigned salesperson.
- `Include archived leads <quality_leads_report/archived-leads>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: ensures that both active and inactive leads are included
  in the results.
- `Add rules for quality leads <quality_leads_report/add-quality-rules>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: includes or excludes results based on criteria that is
  specific to a company or sales team.

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="quality_leads_report/configured-custom-rules.png"
alt="An example of the Custom Filter pop-up window with all of the rules configured." />
<figcaption>An example of the <em>Custom Filter</em> pop-up window with
all of the default rules configured.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Add a starting date filter {#quality_leads_report/starting-date}

Begin by first defining the rule\'s parameter with a date range, by
clicking into the first field, on the left of the row, and typing
[Created On]{.title-ref} in the `Search...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} bar, or by scrolling through the menu\'s list to locate
it.

In the rule\'s operator drop-down menu, define the parameter further by
selecting either:

- `>= (greater than or equal to)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
  specify a start date and include all entries *after* that start date
  (as well as the initial value itself); or
- `is between`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to more sharply define
  a time frame with a clear start and end date. All matching entries
  that fit within the defined start and end dates are included in the
  report.

With either option, use the pop-up calendar\'s day and time pickers, in
the far right field, to define the respective date range. Setting these
values concludes the creation of the first rule.

#### Add a sales team filter {#quality_leads_report/sales-team}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This filter is optional. To view results for the entire company, do
**not** add this filter.
::::

To limit the results of the report to one or more sales teams, click
`New Rule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Next, click the first
field for the new rule, and type [Sales Team]{.title-ref} in the
`Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar, or scroll to search
through the list to locate it.

In the rule\'s second field, select `is in`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu. Selecting this operator limits
results to the sales teams selected in the next field.

Lastly, in the third field, select the desired sales team from the
drop-down menu. Multiple teams can be added in this field, where each
parameter is treated with an \"or\" (e.g. \"any\") operator in the
search logic.

#### Exclude unassigned leads {#quality_leads_report/unassigned-leads}

Next, add a `New Rule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, click
into the first field for the new rule, and type
[Salesperson]{.title-ref} in the `Search...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} bar, or scroll to search through the list to locate it.

In the rule\'s second field, select `is set`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu. Selecting this operator
excludes any leads not assigned to a specific salesperson.

#### Include archived leads {#quality_leads_report/archived-leads}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

This filter is also optional, as it adds archived (inactive) leads to
the report, however it is recommended to include this since it pulls
*all* assigned leads, regardless of status, into the report. This
ensures a more accurate representation of assigned leads is captured.
However, to pull a report that only includes active leads, do **not**
activate this feature.
::::

Next, in the upper-right corner of the
`Add Custom filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window,
move the `Include archived`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} toggle to
active.

![The Add Custom Filter pop-up with emphasis on the Include Archived toggle.](quality_leads_report/include-archived.png){.align-center}

Enabling this feature adds archived (inactive) leads to the report.

#### Add rules for quality leads {#quality_leads_report/add-quality-rules}

The filters added in this step vary, based on how an organization
defines a *quality lead*.

##### Define a quality lead {#track_links/define-a-lead}

As defined earlier, a *quality lead* is a lead that is likely to result
in a won opportunity. Although the exact criteria for a quality lead
varies from organization to organization, it is often a combination of
factors commonly attributed to positive sales outcomes, in addition to
factors valued by the specific organization.

In addition to the basic filters and grouping options outlined in the
general `Quality leads
report <track_links/create-quality-leads-report>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, consider the following filters when defining a quality
lead:

- `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the information in these
  fields can help determine whether or not a lead is a professional
  contact.
- `Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field links to the
  marketing and lead generation efforts from other Odoo applications,
  including *Live Chat*, *Social Marketing*, and *Email Marketing*.
- `Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this filter can be used to
  eliminate or target leads that have reached specific stages.
- `Medium`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a lead\'s source can
  indicate its quality level, as various channels have different won
  rates and expected revenues.
- `Campaign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: adding this filter
  helps track of the success of different marketing efforts to capture
  high quality leads.
- `Lost Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: exclude leads that
  may appear to be quality based on various criteria, but have been
  marked as *lost* for specified reasons.
- `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: include or exclude results
  based on one or more customized tags.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

When adding rules to a custom filter, keep the statements preceding each
rule in mind. The statement above a rule determines whether the search
results must match **all** of the rules below the statement, or **any**
of the rules below the statement.

At the top of the `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
form, there is an option to match `any`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `all`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the
rules. In order to properly run the report, only records that match
**all** of the following filters should be included. Before adding the
filters, make sure `all`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected
in this field.

![Close up on the match all rules option on the add a custom filter pop-up window.](quality_leads_report/match-all-rules.png){.align-center}
::::

After the filters are configured, click `Add`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The default display for the report is a bar graph,
where the leads are grouped by *stage*.

To group the results by salesperson, click the
`🔻(triangle pointed down)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to
the right of the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar to
open the drop-down mega menu. Under the `Group
By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading, select
`Salesperson`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In the same column,
under the `Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading, click
`Add a Custom Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then select
`Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the resulting drop-down
menu to layer in lead *status*, under the parent
`Salesperson`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} grouping.

The report now displays the total count of *quality leads* each
salesperson has received in the designated time period. Because there
are layered `Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filters, the
grouped leads are also color-coded to identify whether they are *active*
or *marked as lost*.

# Resellers

Within Odoo\'s *CRM* app, leads can be forwarded to resellers (or
partners). Leads can be manually assigned, or automatically assigned,
based on the resellers\' designated *level* and location.

## Configuration

To utilize the reseller features, the *Resellers* module first needs to
be installed. Navigate to the `Apps application`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and remove the `Apps`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} filter from the `Search...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} bar. Then, search for [Resellers]{.title-ref}.

![The resellers module in Odoo.](resellers/resellers-module.png){.align-center}

Click `Activate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
`Resellers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} module card that appears.
Doing so installs the module, and returns to the main Odoo dashboard.

After the module is installed, navigate to the
`CRM app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Under the
`Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} menu is a new
section, titled `Resellers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, with
three options beneath it: `Partner Levels`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Partner Activations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `Commission Plans`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

## Partner levels {#crm/partner-levels}

Partner *levels* are used to differentiate between various resellers. To
view the partner levels, navigate to
`CRM app --> Configuration --> Resellers: Partner Levels`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

On the `Partner Levels`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page that
appears, there are three default levels:

- `Gold`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Silver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Bronze`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

New levels can be added, as needed, by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and filling out the resulting level form.

Existing levels can also be edited and renamed, if desired, as well. To
modify a level, select it from the list, and proceed to make any desired
changes from the level form page that appears.

Level weight is used to decide the probability a partner to be assigned
a lead or opportunity. On the level form, assign a numerical value
(greater than zero) to the `Level Weight`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. If the weight is zero, no leads are assigned.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

*Level Weight* can be assigned on an individual contact record. The
weight assigned on the individual record overwrites the default weight
assigned on the level configuration form.
::::

## Partner activations {#crm/partner-activations}

Partner *activations* are used to identify the status of a partner.
Activations are assigned on an individual contact record, and can be
used to group or filter the *Partnership Analysis* report
(`CRM app --> Reporting --> Partnerships`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}).

To view the partner levels, navigate to
`CRM app --> Configuration --> Partner
Activations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Three activation types are created by default in the *CRM* app:

- `Fully Operational`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Ramp-up`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `First Contact`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

New partner activations can be added, as needed, by clicking
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and entering a
`Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the new line that appears.
Then, select the desired status in the `Active`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column.

Existing partner activations can also be edited and renamed, if desired.
To rename a status, click the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field of a desired level, and enter a new name.

To change the active status of an activation, slide the toggle in the
`Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column of the desired
activation to the *inactive* position.

alt="The list of default partner activations in the CRM app." />
<figcaption>The list of default Partner Activations in the CRM app. The
toggle for First Contact is in the inactive position, while the rest are
active.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Partner assignments

After `partner levels <crm/partner-levels>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `partner activations
<crm/partner-activations>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} configured.

To update an individual partner record, navigate to
`CRM app --> Sales -->
Customers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click the Kanban
card for the desired partner to open the customer record.

On the customer record, click the `Partner Assignment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.

Click the `Partner Level`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and
select an option from the drop-down menu to assign a level. Click the
`Activation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and select a
partner activation type from the drop-down list, if desired. Then, click
the `Level Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to assign a
different level weight, if necessary.

## Publish partners

With the Odoo *Website* and *Resellers* apps installed, a new webpage
([/partners]{.title-ref}) is created to display a list of all active
partners from the *CRM* app.

Next, return to `CRM app --> Sales --> Customers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click the Kanban card for a partner. From
that partner\'s contact form, click the
`Go to Website`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the
top of the page to open that partner\'s webpage.

Next, click `Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top-right
of the partner\'s webpage, and use the `building
blocks <../../../websites/website/web_design/building_blocks>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to add any additional design elements, or information about
the partner.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

A company summary is a useful addition to this page.
::::

After making any necessary changes to the page, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. At the top of the page, slide
the `Unpublished`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} toggle to the
active, `Published`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} position, if
needed.

Repeat these steps for all partners.

# Unattended leads report

*Unattended leads* are leads that have scheduled activities that are
either due or past due. Whenever an activity is scheduled, Odoo tracks
the due date, and sends email reminders to the users the activity is
assigned to.

An *unattended leads report* compiles all active leads in the pipeline
with due or past due activities, allowing a sales manager to identify
which opportunities require immediate attention.

By pulling a daily unattended leads report, sales managers can remind
their teams to address outstanding activities before they become past
due, helping avoid neglected leads and reinforcing proactive behaviors
in their salespeople.

::: example
A sales manager starts their day by pulling an unattended leads report,
and upon switching to list view, they see the following:

![List view of a sample Unattended Leads report with the activities emphasized.](unattended_leads_report/unattended-leads-example.png){.align-center}

Their team member, Mitchell, has two leads in the *Proposition* stage
with activities that are due.

The yellow `📞 (phone)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon
indicates that the [Modern Open Space]{.title-ref} lead has a phone call
activity scheduled for today. The red `✉️ (envelope)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon indicates that the [5 VP Chairs]{.title-ref} lead
has an email activity scheduled that is past due.

Clicking on the [5 VP Chairs]{.title-ref} lead, the sales manager opens
the record of the lead and reviews the chatter. They see that the email
was scheduled to be sent two days ago, but Mitchell never marked this
activity as done.

![Example of overdue activities notification in the chatter of a lead.](unattended_leads_report/overdue-activities-email.png){.align-center}
:::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

In order to pull a unattended leads report, sales teams **must** be
regularly utilizing activity in the *CRM* pipeline, on individual lead
and opportunity cards.

It is **not** possible to compile a complete report if the sales people
are not using the *Activities* feature in the *chatter*

For more information, refer to
`Activities <../../../essentials/activities>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
::::

## Create an unattended leads report

To create an unattended leads report, first navigate to
`CRM app --> Reporting -->
Pipeline`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} to open the
`Pipeline Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard. Click
into the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar at the top
of the page, and remove all of the default filters.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Created on`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter can remain
active, as this variable may be useful to include in the report.
::::

Next, add custom filters by clicking the
`🔻(triangle pointed down)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to
the right of the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar to
open the drop-down menu that contains `Filters`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns. Under the
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, click
`Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which opens an
`Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

The `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
allows for the creation of more specific filters.

### Add custom filters

In order to generate an unattended leads report, filters need to be
created for the following conditions:

> - `Past due activities <unattended_leads_report/past-due>`{.interpreted-text
>   role="ref"}: limits the results to only include leads with an
>   assigned activity where the due date has past. This can be altered
>   to include activities due to occur on the date the report is
>   generated as well.
> - `Unassigned leads <unattended_leads_report/exclude-unassigned>`{.interpreted-text
>   role="ref"}: excludes leads without an assigned salesperson.
> - `Specific sales teams <unattended_leads_report/sales-team>`{.interpreted-text
>   role="ref"}: limits results to only include leads assigned to one or
>   more sales teams. This filter is optional and should not be included
>   if the report is intended for the entire company.

#### Add filter for past due activities {#unattended_leads_report/past-due}

Click the first field for the new rule, and type
[Activities]{.title-ref} in the `Search...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} bar, or scroll to search through the list to locate it.
Then, next to `Activities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click the
`> (greater than sign)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open a new
drop-down menu with secondary conditions.

Type [Due Date]{.title-ref} in the `Search...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} bar, or scroll to search through the list. Click
`Due Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add it to the rule.

> ![Custom filter pop-up with emphasis on the options for activities and due date.](unattended_leads_report/activities-due.png){.align-center}

Then, click into then next field and select `<=`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu. Selecting this operator
includes all activities with a due date up to, and including, the date
selected in the next field.

The third field can be left as today\'s date, or adjusted as needed.

#### Exclude unassigned leads {#unattended_leads_report/exclude-unassigned}

After filtering for activities, add a `New Rule`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, click into the first field for the new rule, and
type [Salesperson]{.title-ref} in the `Search...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} bar, or scroll to search through the list to locate it.

In the rule\'s second field, select `is set`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu. Selecting this operator
excludes any leads not assigned to a specific salesperson.

#### Add a Sales team {#unattended_leads_report/sales-team}

:::: note

through the list to locate it.

In the rule\'s second field, select `is in`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu. Selecting this operator limits
results to the sales teams selected in the next field.

rules. In order to properly run the report, only records that match
**all** of the following filters should be included. Before adding the
filters, make sure `all`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected
in this field.

![Example of overdue activities notification in the chatter of a lead.](unattended_leads_report/all-custom-filter.png){.align-center}

After the filters are configured, click `Add`{.interpreted-text

salesperson where an activity is past due, or is due on the current
date. The default display is a bar graph, where the leads are grouped by
*stage*.

To group the results by salesperson, click the
`🔻(triangle pointed down)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to

memberships sold and managed within the *Members* application.

To access the *Memberships Analysis* report, navigate to
`Members app --> Reporting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

## Navigate the report

The default *Members Analysis* report displays a bar chart, measuring
the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of memberships against
the amount of `Revenue Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
data is grouped by the assigned salesperson, then by the month the
membership begins.

![A sample of the members analysis report.](members_analysis/example-report.png){.align-center}

Additional `Group By <search/group>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
options include the following:

- `Salesperson`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the internal user in
  charge of the contact. This information is managed in the
  *Salesperson* field on the *Sales & Purchase* tab on the contact\'s
  record.
- `Associated Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the contact
  listed as the *Associated Member* on the *Membership* tab on the

# Members

The *Members* application is where all operations related to memberships
can be configured and managed. The *Members* app integrates with the
*Sales* and *Accounting* applications to sell and invoice memberships
directly to customers.

## Membership products

To create a new membership product, navigate to
`Members app --> Configuration -->
Membership Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open a blank product record.

Complete the blank form with the necessary information, including the
`Membership
Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Membership products require a start and end date, as they are used to
determine `membership
status <sales/membership-status>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
Membership products can be sold *before* their active start date.
::::

![A new membership product in the members app.](members/membership-product.png){.align-center}

contact to open that specific contact\'s detail form.

From the resulting contact form, open the `Membership`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and click `Buy
Membership`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

On the `Join Membership`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window that appears, select a `Membership`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu. Then, configure a
`Member Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Click `Invoice Membership`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} when both
fields are filled in. Doing so reveals a
`Membership Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, wherein
invoices can be confirmed and completed.

listed on the `Membership`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of
each contact record:

- `Non Member`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a partner who has
  **not** applied for membership.
- `Cancelled Member`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a member who
  has cancelled their membership.
- `Old Member`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a member whose
  membership end date has passed.
- `Waiting Member`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a member who has
  applied for membership, but whose invoice has not yet been created.
- `Invoiced Member`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a member whose
  invoice has been created, but has not been paid.
- `Paid Member`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a member who has
  paid the membership fee.

## Publish members directory

To publish a list of active members on the website, the *Online Members
Directory* application must first be
`installed <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. After
installing the module, add the [/members]{.title-ref} page to the
website\'s menu by
`editing the website menu <../websites/website/structure/header_footer>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

# Product combos

The **Product Combos** feature allows users to define and manage
combination options for a single product.

In the context of a restaurant, the feature enables users to create
multiple-choice menus. For example, a user can define a main dish and
specify various options for sides, drinks, or desserts that customers
can combine with the main dish.

In retail, this feature allows you to create a product set with multiple
products to choose from and combine.

## Configuration

First, you need to create combination choices. To do so:

1.  Go to
    `Point of Sale --> Products --> Product Combos`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.
2.  Name your combo and add the products you want customers to choose
    from by clicking `Add
    a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. You can also include an
    extra price for each option in the `Extra Price`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} column.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

As a reference, the selected product\'s original price is displayed in
the `Original
Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.
::::

![image](combos/combo-form.png)

Second, you need to create a specific product to gather combo choices.
To do this:

1.  Go to `Point of Sale --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

2.  Set the `Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
    `Combo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and fill in the `General
    Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    The sales price of the combo product is fixed and does not vary
    based on the individual prices of included items or the quantity of
    items in the combo. The combo product price is only affected by the
    extra price optionally defined at the combo choice creation or if a
    variant of one of the items has a specified extra price.
    ::::

3.  Go to the `Combo Choices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
    click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select
    the combinations to add. You can also create a new combination at
    this step by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on
    the popup window.

![image](combos/combo-product-form.png)

Once you have created and added the combo choices into a product, you
can sell combos in your retail store or restaurant.

## Practical application

`Open a POS session <pos/session-start>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
and select the combo product. Choose the options and click
`Add to order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. As a reminder, the
extra price appears under the related choices.

# Self-signed certificate for ePOS printers {#epos_ssc/ePOS printers}

To work with Odoo, some printer models that can be used without an
`IoT system </applications/general/iot>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
may require `the HTTPS protocol <https>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
to establish a secure connection between the browser and the printer.
However, trying to reach the printer\'s IP address using HTTPS leads to
a warning page on most web browsers. In that case, you can temporarily
`force the connection <epos_ssc/instructions>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, which allows you to reach the page in HTTPS and use the
ePOS printer in Odoo as long as the browser window stays open.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

The connection is lost after closing the browser window. Therefore, this
method should only be used as a **workaround** or as a pre-requisite for
the `following instructions
<epos_ssc/instructions>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

## Generate, export, and import self-signed certificates {#epos_ssc/instructions}

For a long-term solution, you must generate a **self-signed
certificate**. Then, export and import it into your browser.

## Check if the certificate was imported correctly

To confirm your printer\'s connection is secure, connect to its IP
address using HTTPS. For example, navigate to
[https://192.168.1.25]{.title-ref} in your browser. If the SSL
certificate has been applied correctly, you should no longer see a
warning page, and the address bar should display a padlock icon,
indicating that the connection is secure.

# Secure connection (HTTPS)

If **Direct Devices** is enabled in a Point of Sale settings (for
example, if you use an `ePos
printer <epos_printers>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}), HTTP becomes
the default protocol.

## Force your Point of Sale to use a secure connection (HTTPS)

Add a new **key** in the **System Parameters** to force your Point of
Sale to use a secure connection with the HTTPS protocol.

To do so, activate the
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, go to
`Settings -->
Technical --> Parameters --> System Parameters`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then create a new parameter, add the following
values and click on *Save*.

- **Key**: [point_of_sale.enforce_https]{.title-ref}
- **Value**: [True]{.title-ref}

# IoT system connection

To connect the POS with an
`IoT system </applications/general/iot>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}:

1.  Make sure both the Point of Sale and Internet of Things (IoT) apps
    are installed on your database.

2.  Set up the `/applications/general/iot/iot_box`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} or
    `/applications/general/iot/windows_iot`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}.

3.  Connect the peripheral devices to the IoT system:

      Device             Instructions
      ------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Printer            Connect a supported receipt printer to a `USB (Universal Serial Bus)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} port or to the network, and power it on. Refer to `Order printing
                         <pos/restaurant/orders-printing>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
      Cash drawer        The cash drawer should be connected to the printer with an RJ25 cable.
      Barcode scanner    The barcode scanner must end barcodes with an [ENTER]{.title-ref} character (keycode 28) in order for the barcode scanner to be compatible. This is most likely the barcode scanner\'s default configuration.
      Scale              Connect the scale and power it on. Refer to `/applications/general/iot/devices/scale`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
      Customer display   Connect a screen to the `IoT (Internet of Things)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} box to display the `PoS
                         (Point of Sale)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} order. Refer to `/applications/general/iot/devices/screen`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
      Payment terminal   The connection process depends on the terminal. Refer to the `payment terminals
                         documentation </applications/sales/point_of_sale/payment_methods>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

4.  `Connect the IoT system to your Odoo database </applications/general/iot/connect>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}.

5.  `Access the POS settings <configuration/settings>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and select your POS, or click the vertical ellipsis

## Usage guidelines {#pos/employee_login/use}

### Logging in

Once the **Log in with Employees** feature is enabled, employees must
log in to `open a POS
session <pos/session-start>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and access
the POS interface. They can `scan their employee badge
<pos/employee_login/badge>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, click the
`fa-users`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} icon
(`users`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) to select their name from
the list of authorized users, or by entering `their PIN code
<pos/employee_login/pin>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} in the
`Enter your PIN`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![Login window to open a session when the multiple cashiers feature is active](employee_login/log-in.png)

To switch between users during an
`active session <pos/session-start>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
click on the currently logged-in employee\'s name at the top right of
the POS screen and select the user to switch to.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

In the absence of a scanner, click the `fa-barcode`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} icon (`barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) to scan
barcodes using the webcam.
::::

### Logging in with badges {#pos/employee_login/badge}

Employees can log in using their badge. To configure badge-based login,
assign a unique badge ID to the employee\'s profile in the **Employees**
module:

1.  Navigate to the **Employees** module.
2.  Open the form view of the specific employee.
3.  Go to the `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
4.  The `Attendance/Point of Sale/Manufacturing`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} category offers two options:
    - Manually enter any badge ID in the `Badge ID`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"} field.
    - Click `Generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a
      unique badge ID automatically.
5.  Click `Print Badge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to generate a
    barcode representation of the assigned badge ID.

To switch users within an open POS session using a badge, you must first
lock the session. To do so, click the `fa-lg fa-lock`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} icon (`lock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) to return
to the login screen. Then, the new employee can scan their badge to log
in.

### Adding a PIN Code {#pos/employee_login/pin}

For enhanced security, employees may be forced to enter a PIN code each
time they log into a POS session. To set up a PIN code for an employee:

1.  Navigate to the **Employees** module.
2.  Open the form view of the relevant employee.
3.  Go to the `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
4.  Enter a desired numerical code in the `PIN Code`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field of the
    `Attendance/Point of Sale/Manufacturing`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} category.

:::: note

Once the payment method is created, you can select it in your POS
settings. To do so, go to the
`POS' settings <configuration/settings>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
click `Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and add the payment
method under the `Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

## Tips {#adyen/tips}

Odoo Point of Sale allows tipping with an Adyen terminal. To configure
this option, go to the
`POS settings <configuration/settings>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
enable the `Tips <pos/restaurant/tips>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
and the `Add tip through payment terminal (Adyen)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} settings, then click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

2.  Click `Payment <pos/restaurant/bills/payment>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and select the `relevant payment
    method <adyen/method-creation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. The
    `Adyen`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} terminal displays the
    transaction and suggests adding tips.
3.  Add a tip amount on the terminal and validate.
4.  In Odoo POS, click `fa-heart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    `Tip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, enter the tip amount, and
    click `Ok`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
5.  Click `Close Tab`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to validate the

Netherlands and Luxembourg. - Odoo works with the Ingenico Lane/, Desk/,
and Move/ payment terminals as they support the TLV communication
protocol through TCP/IP.
::::

## Configuration

### Connect an IoT system

Connecting an Ingenico payment terminal to Odoo is a feature that
requires an IoT system. For more information on how to connect an IoT
system to your database, please refer to the `IoT

:::

## Configuration

### Configure the payment method

Activate **Stripe** in the settings by going to
`Point of Sale --> Configuration -->
Settings --> Payment Terminals`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
and enabling `Stripe`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then, create the payment method:

- Go to
  `Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Payment Methods`{.interpreted-text

  `Stripe Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field;
- Click
  `Don't forget to complete Stripe connect before using this payment method.`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}

![payment method creation form](stripe/create-method-stripe.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Click `Identify Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to allow
this payment method **exclusively** for identified customers. For any
unidentified customers to be able to pay with Stripe, leave the
`Identify Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
unchecked. - The `Outstanding Account`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and the `Intermediary Account`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} can stay empty to use the default accounts. - Find your
payment terminal serial number under the device or on [Stripe\'s
dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com).
::::

### Connect Stripe to Odoo

Click `Connect Stripe`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so
redirects you automatically to a configuration page. Fill in all the
information to create your Stripe account and link it with Odoo. Once
the forms are completed, the API keys
(`Publishable Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Secret Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) can be retrieved on
**Stripe\'s** website. To do so, click
`Get your Secret and Publishable keys`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, click the keys to copy them, and paste them into the
corresponding fields in Odoo. Your terminal is ready to be configured in
a POS.

![stripe connection form](stripe/stripe-connect.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- When you use **Stripe** exclusively in Point of Sale, you only need
the **Secret Key** to use your terminal. - When you use Stripe as
**payment provider**, the `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can
stay set as `Disabled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. - For
databases hosted **On-Premise**, the `Connect Stripe`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button does not work. To retrieve the API keys
manually, log in to your [Stripe
dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com), type [API]{.title-ref} in the
search bar, and click `Developers > API`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

### Configure the payment terminal

Swipe right on your payment terminal, click `Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, enter the admin PIN code, validate and select your
network.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- The user\'s device and the terminal must share the same network. - In
case of a Wi-Fi connection, the network must be secured. - You must
enter the admin PIN code to access your payment terminal settings. By
default, this code is [07139]{.title-ref}.
::::

### Link the payment method to a POS

To add a **payment method** to your point of sale, go to
`Point of Sale -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Select the POS, scroll down to the `Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, and add your payment method for **Stripe** in
the `Payment Methods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

## Troubleshooting

### Payment terminal unavailable in your Stripe account

If the payment terminal is unavailable in your Stripe account, you must
add it manually:

1.  Log into your [Stripe\'s dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
    and go to
    `Stripe dashboard --> Payments --> Readers --> Locations`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"};
2.  Add a location by clicking the `+ New`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} button or selecting an already created location;
3.  Click the `+ New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
    `Readers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box and fill in the
    required information.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

You must provide a **registration code**. To retrieve that code, swipe
right on your device, enter the admin PIN code (by default:
[07139]{.title-ref}), validate, and click `Generate a
registration code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

`ePOS printers <configuration/epos_printers>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, and in-store `electronic shelf labels
<pricing/electronic_labels>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

## Customer display {#pos/display}

The **customer display** feature provides real-time updates on a
secondary screen for customers during the checkout process. This screen
shows the `items in the cart <pos/sell>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
the subtotal as items are added, and details throughout the payment
process. It also displays the total amount, the selected
`payment method <payment_methods>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, and
any change to be returned.

![customer screen](pos_hardware/display.png)

**European regulations**.
::::

::: seealso
`../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/product_management/configure/uom`{.interpreted-text

:::

### European regulations

When using scales in commercial transactions, the database integrated
with a scale must be configured to meet specific European requirements.
This includes supporting at least three decimal places for accuracy and
using proper rounding for units of measure, such as [kg]{.title-ref}
instead of generic [units]{.title-ref}.

If the database is not compliant, a red
`fa-balance-scale`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
(`scale`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) icon displays as a warning.
Click this icon to view the reasons for non-compliance and then select
`Apply changes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to automatically
apply the necessary changes to the settings. Once the database meets all
regulatory requirements, the `fa-balance-scale`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} (`scale`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) icon turns
green.

::: admonition
Additional guidelines

Both the `customer <pos/display>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and POS
displays must have a minimum diagonal size of 6 inches. For optimal
readability, larger screens are recommended.
:::

### Using a scale in PoS

1.  `Open a POS session <pos/session-start>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
2.  Select the product to weigh on the order screen or scan its barcode.
3.  Place the product on the scale and wait for the weight to be
    displayed in the popup window.
4.  Once the weight is determined, the price is automatically computed.
5.  Click `Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    `fa-angle-double-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} to add the
    product to the cart.
6.  Remove the previous product from the scale.

# Cash rounding

**Cash rounding** is required when the lowest physical denomination of
currency, or the smallest coin, is higher than the minimum unit of
account.

For example, some countries require their companies to round up or down
the total amount of an invoice to the nearest five cents, when the
payment is made in cash.

Each point of sale in Odoo can be configured to apply cash rounding to
the totals of its bills or receipts.

## Configuration

Go to `Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and enable *Cash Rounding*, then click on *Save*.

![image](cash_rounding/cash_rounding01.png){.align-center}

Go to `Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Point of
Sale`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, open the point of sale
you want to configure, and enable the *Cash Rounding* option.

To define the **Rounding Method**, open the drop-down list and click on
*Create and Edit\...*.

Define here your *Rounding Precision*, *Profit Account*, and *Loss

# Discount tags (barcode scanner)

If you want to sell your products with a discount, for a product getting
close to its expiration date for example, you can use discount tags.
They allow you to scan discount barcodes.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To use discount tags you will need to use a barcode scanner.
::::

## Barcode Nomenclature

To use discounts tags, we need to learn about barcode nomenclature.

Let\'s say you want to have a discount for the product with the
following barcode:

![image](discount_tags/discount_tags01.png){.align-center}

You can find the *Default Nomenclature* under the settings of your PoS
interface.

![image](discount_tags/discount_tags02.png){.align-center}

![image](discount_tags/discount_tags03.png){.align-center}

Let\'s say you want 50% discount on a product you have to start your
barcode with 22 (for the discount barcode nomenclature) and then 50 (for
the %) before adding the product barcode. In our example, the barcode
would be:

![image](discount_tags/discount_tags04.png){.align-center}

## Scan the products & tags

You first have to scan the desired product (in our case, a lemon).

![image](discount_tags/discount_tags05.png){.align-center}

And then scan the discount tag. The discount will be applied and you can
finish the transaction.

# Discounts

By offering discounts, you can entice your customers and drastically
increase your revenue. It is vital to offer discounts, whether they are
time-limited, seasonal or manually given.

To manage discounts, Odoo has powerful features that help set up a
pricing strategy tailored to every business.

## Apply manual discounts

If you seldom use discounts, applying manual ones might be the easiest
solution for your point of sale.

You can either apply a discount on the whole order or on specific
products inside an order.

### Apply a discount on a product

From your PoS session interface, use the *Disc* button.

![View of the discount button for manual discount](discounts/discounts_01.png){.align-center}

Then, you can input a discount over the product that is currently
selected.

### Apply a global discount

To apply a discount on the whole order, go to `Point of
Sale --> Configuration --> Point of Sale`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select your PoS.

Once on your PoS form, select *Global Discounts*, under the *Pricing*
category.

![View of the feature to enable for global discount](discounts/discounts_02.png){.align-center}

Now, you have a new *Discount* button appearing on your PoS interface.

![View of the button to use for global discount via the pos interface](discounts/discounts_03.png){.align-center}

Click on it and enter the wanted discount.

![View of the discount offered in the payment summary](discounts/discounts_04.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

On this example, there is a global discount of 50% as well as a specific
50% discount on oranges.
::::

## Apply time-limited discounts

To activate time-limited discounts, you must activate the *Pricelists*
feature. To do so, go to `Point of Sale -->
Configuration --> Point of Sale`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
and open your PoS. Then, enable the pricelist feature.

![View of the pricelist feature](discounts/discounts_05.png){.align-center}

Once activated, you must choose the pricelists you want to make
available in the PoS and define a default one.

### Create a pricelist

By default, Odoo has a *Public Pricelist* configured. To create more, go
to `Point of Sale --> Products --> Pricelists`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then click on create.

When creating a pricelist, you can set several criteria to use a
specific price: period, min. quantity, etc. You can also decide to apply
that pricelist on specific products or on the whole range.

![View of a time-limited pricelist for two products](discounts/discounts_06.png){.align-center}

### Using a pricelist with the PoS interface

On the PoS interface, a new button appears. Use it to select a
pricelist.

![View of the button to use for time-limited discounts via the pos interface](discounts/discounts_07.png){.align-center}

Click on it to instantly update the prices with the selected pricelist.
Then, you can finalize the order.

# Electronic shelf labels

Electronic shelf labels allow you to display product information like
prices and barcodes on store shelves and to synchronize them remotely
from the backend. This removes the need to print new labels when product
information changes.

![electronic label from Pricer](electronic_labels/electronic-label.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Odoo uses electronic labels from [Pricer](https://www.pricer.com/).
::::

## Configuration

### Pricer setup

1.  [Get in touch with Pricer](https://www.pricer.com/contact) to create
    and configure your Pricer account.

2.  Create your stores: one pricer store equates to one physical store.

3.  Link as many transceivers as needed to the Pricer store(s).

4.  Create the following variables to share product information between
    your Odoo database system and Pricer. These variables act like
    placeholders on the label template.

    - \`itemId\`: this holds the unique internal identifier assigned to
      each product
    - \`itemName\`: the actual name of the product
    - \`price\`: the selling price of the product, including any
      applicable taxes
    - \`presentation\`: the template name used in Pricer for displaying
      the product information on the label
    - \`currency\`: the currency of your company (e.g., USD, EUR)
    - \`barcode\`: the barcode number associated with each product

    :::: important
    ::: title
    Important
    :::

    The names for these variables must be **identical** in your Pricer
    database.
    ::::

5.  Create a template named [NORMAL]{.title-ref}. This template is used
    to display information on your digital tags.

Once your account, stores, variables, and template are configured on
Pricer, you can proceed with the setup of your Odoo database.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The account associated with your Pricer store must have access to send
API requests to Pricer.
::::

### Odoo setup

As a pre-requisite, `activate <general/install>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} the `POS Pricer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} module
*(technical name: pos_pricer)* to have all the required features to use
Pricer electronic tags.

![Installing POS Pricer module from Apps](electronic_labels/pricer-module.png)

Once the module is activated, configure your
`pricer stores <pricer_tags/stores>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
associate `Pricer tags <pricer_tags/tags>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
with your products.

#### Pricer stores {#pricer_tags/stores}

Similarly to the configuration in Pricer, you need to create one pricer
store per physical location. To do so, go to
`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Pricer Stores`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and fill in the line with the required information:

- `Store Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: you can put any name
  of your liking.
- `Pricer Tenant Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the name of
  your company account in Pricer, usually followed by
  [-country_code]{.title-ref}. This value is provided by Pricer.
- `Pricer Login`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the login of your
  Pricer account.
- `Pricer Password`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the password of
  your Pricer account.
- `Pricer Store ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the ID of the
  related Pricer store as defined on your Pricer database.

![Configuring a Pricer Store](electronic_labels/pricer-stores-setup.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- The `Pricer Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column is
updated automatically when a label is linked to a product. - The
`Last Update`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Last Update Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns are
updated automatically when the tags are updated.
::::

#### Pricer tags {#pricer_tags/tags}

For a label to display specific product information, the label needs to
be associated with the product. To do so:

1.  Open the product form by going to
    `Point of Sale --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and clicking `New`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} or selecting an existing product.

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    If you are creating a new product, configure and save it before
    associating any Pricer tags.
    ::::

2.  Go to the `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, scroll to
    the `Pricer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and select
    the corresponding `Pricer Store`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

    ![Linking Pricer tags to products](electronic_labels/pricer-product.png)

3.  Fill in the `Pricer tags ids`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    field by copying the label\'s ID from the label itself or scanning
    its barcode.

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    Pricer tag IDs are composed of a letter followed by 16 digits.
    ::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- We recommended using a barcode scanner to speed up the encoding
process. - When setting up Pricer with Odoo for the first time, it is
recommended that you configure only one product first. Before
configuring more products, ensure you can display their information on a
Pricer tag.
::::

Now that you have a product associated with a Pricer tag, we can send
its information to Pricer.

### Practical application

Odoo automatically sends requests to Pricer to synchronize the tags
every 12 hours if you make any modifications to:

> - Product name, price, barcode, or customer taxes
> - Currency
> - Associated Pricer store or Pricer tags

To force the update, activate the
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Then:

1.  Go to
    `Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Pricer Store`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
2.  Select the desired store(s).
3.  Click `Update tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to update all
    tags affected by changes to:
    - Product name, price, barcode, or customer taxes
    - Currency
    - Associated Pricer store or Pricer tags

Alternatively, click `Update all tags`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to force the update of every tag, regardless of whether
changes were made.

![Update all Pricer tags](electronic_labels/update-all.png)

If Pricer has processed and accepted the request, the status field shows
`Update
successfully sent to Pricer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If
there is any issue, the system displays an error message.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

If a request sent to Pricer fails, Odoo still considers that the product
has been updated. In that case, we recommend forcing the update of all
tags.
::::

### Discount labels

To display a discount label on a Pricer Tag, you need to link a
`pricelist <pricelists>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to the product
variant associated with the tag.

To do so, open the product variant form:

1.  Go to
    `Point of Sale --> Products --> Product Variants`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
2.  Select the product you want to apply a discount to.

Then, set the desired pricelist:

1.  Go to the `General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    tab.
2.  Select a pricelist in the `Pricer Sales Pricelist`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field.

Once a pricelist is set, the `On Sale Price`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field appears, showing the `Sales
Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with the discount applied.

![Linking a pricelist to a product variant](electronic_labels/pricer-sales-pricelist.png)

After updating your electronic labels, a [PROMO]{.title-ref} tag should
appear on the electronic label, displaying both the old, crossed-out
price and the discounted price.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Currently, pricelists that offer discounts for purchasing multiple
units or derive their prices from other pricelists are not supported. -
Assigning a pricelist to a product variant only affects the electronic
label display. Scanning the product at the point of sale does not
automatically apply the discount.

# Flexible taxes (fiscal positions)

When running a business, you may need to apply different taxes and
record transactions on various accounts based on the location and type
of business of your customers and providers.

The **fiscal positions** feature enables you to establish rules that
automatically select the right taxes and accounts used for each
transaction.

::: seealso

## Configuration

To enable the feature, go to
`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, scroll down to the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, and enable `Flexible Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Then, set a default fiscal position that should be applied to all sales

# Pricelists

Pricelists allow you to adjust product prices depending on various
criteria automatically. For example, you can set POS-specific prices,
create temporary discount periods, reward specific customers, or offer
discounts when set quantities are ordered.

## Configuration {#pricelists/configuration}

Navigate to the
`general POS app settings <configuration/settings>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and ensure `Flexible Pricelists`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} are enabled under the `Pricing`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section.

`Multiple prices per product <pricelists/simple>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} is the default pricelist option for setting simple fixed
price rules per product. Select
`Advanced price rules (discounts, formulas)
<pricelists/advanced>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to apply price
rules to multiple products at once and to compute prices dynamically
using percentage discounts or more complex formulas in addition to
setting fixed prices.

![Enabling pricelists in the general P0S settings](pricelists/settings.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The selected pricelist type applies to the entire database, including
the `Sales
<../../sales/products_prices/prices/pricing>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and
`eCommerce <ecommerce/prices/pricelists>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
apps.
::::

### Create pricelists {#pricelists/create}

Go to `Point of Sale --> Products --> Pricelists`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
or select an existing pricelist. The pricelist setup differs depending
on the `selected pricelist
option <pricelists/configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

#### Multiple prices per product {#pricelists/simple}

When pricelists are configured to use the
`Multiple prices per product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option,
it is possible to use multiple fixed prices for different products or
their variants depending, if necessary, on one or several conditions. To
add a new price rule to a pricelist:

1.  Click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select a
    **product** and its **variant** if needed.
2.  Add the condition(s):
    - a product quantity to be reached by using the
      `Min. Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column;
    - a determined period during which the pricelist is applied by using
      the `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
      `End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns.
3.  Add the `Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to be applied
    when the conditions are met (if any).

![Setup form of a multiple prices pricelist](pricelists/multiple-prices.png)

#### Advanced price rules {#pricelists/advanced}

When pricelists are configured to use the
`Advanced price rules (discounts, formulas)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option, it is possible to use percentage
discounts/mark-ups and formulas in addition to using fixed prices. To
add a new price rule to a pricelist, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In the pop-up windows:

1.  Select a `Computation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} method:
    - `Fixed Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to set a new
      fixed price (similarly to the `Multiple prices
      per product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option).
    - `Discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to compute a
      percentage discount (e.g., [10.00]{.title-ref} %) or mark-up
      (e.g., [-10.00]{.title-ref} %).
    - `Formula`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to compute the price
      according to a formula. It is required to define what the
      calculation is **based on** (`Sales Price`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"}, `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
      `Other
      Pricelist`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}). You can then:
      - Apply a percentage `Discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
        or mark-up.

      - Add an `Extra Fee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (e.g., \$
        [5.00]{.title-ref}) or subtract a fixed amount (e.g., \$
        [-5.00]{.title-ref}).

      - Define a `Rounding Method <cash_rounding>`{.interpreted-text
        role="doc"} by forcing the price after
        `Discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to be a multiple
        of the value set. The `Extra Fee`{.interpreted-text
        role="guilabel"} is applied afterward.

        ::: example
        To have the final price end with [.99]{.title-ref}, set the
        `Rounding Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
        [1.00]{.title-ref} and the `Extra Fee`{.interpreted-text
        role="guilabel"} to [-0.01]{.title-ref}.
        :::

      - Specify the minimum (e.g., \$ [20.00]{.title-ref} ) and maximum
        (e.g., \$ [50.00]{.title-ref} ) profit
        `Margins`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for computations
        based on `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
2.  Select on which product(s) the price rule should be **applied**:
    - `All Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    - a `Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    - a `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    - a `Product Variant`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
3.  Add conditions, such as a specific quantity to reach for the price
    to change by using the `Min. Quantity`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field or a specific period during which the
    pricelist should be applied by using the
    `Validity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields.

![Setup form to configure an advanced pricelist](pricelists/price-rules.png)

### Select pricelists

Go to the
`specific POS settings <configuration/settings>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and add all the available pricelists in the
`Available`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Then, set its
**default pricelist** in the `Default`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

When you `open a POS session <pos/session-start>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, click the **pricelists** button, and select the desired
pricelist from the list.

![Button to select a pricelist on the POS frontend](pricelists/pricelist-button.png)

### QR codes to generate invoices

Customers can also request an invoice by scanning the **QR code**
printed on their receipt. Upon scanning, they must fill in a form with
their billing information and click `Get my
invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. On the one hand, doing so
generates an invoice available for download. On the other hand, the
order status goes from `Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Posted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Invoiced`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the Odoo backend.

![order status change](receipts_invoices/order-status.png)

To use this feature, you have to enable QR codes on receipts by going to
`Point of
Sale --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, select the POS in the
`Point of Sale`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, scroll down to
the `Bills & Receipts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section and
enable `Use QR code on
ticket`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Restaurant features

Odoo Point of Sale provides various features to manage a restaurant or a
bar:

- `Organizing the floors and tables <pos/restaurant/floors>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"};
- `Taking orders <pos/restaurant/orders>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"};
- `Communicating with the kitchen or bar through the POS <pos/restaurant/orders-printing>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"};
- `Printing and splitting bills <pos/restaurant/bills>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"};
- `Collecting tips <pos/restaurant/tips>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"};
- `Setting different taxes for takeaway food <pricing/fiscal_position>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.

Three main buttons in the POS register allow for navigating between the
`Floor plan
<pos/restaurant/floors>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} view, tables, and
`orders <pos/restaurant/orders>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:

- `Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Access the
  `Floor plan <pos/restaurant/floors>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  view.
- `Table`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a table or order
  number, then click `Jump`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to access
  them. The button\'s label updates to display the selected number. When
  applicable, click `Book
  table`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the table\'s
  occupancy.
- `fa-plus-circle`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  (`order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}):
  `Create a direct sales order <pos/restaurant/orders>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} that is not linked to any table. Each click generates the
  next order in the sequence. Click `Release Order`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to cancel the order (if no products have been added)
  and return to the
  `Floor plan <pos/restaurant/floors>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

# Barcodes

Using a barcode scanner to process point-of-sale orders improves your
efficiency in providing quicker customer service. Barcode scanners can
be used both to scan products or to log employees into a POS session.

## Configuration

To use a barcode scanner, you must enable the feature in the Inventory
app. Go to `Inventory --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, in the `Barcode`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, tick `Barcode Scanner`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and save.

![barcode setting in the Inventory application](barcode/barcode-inventory.png){.align-center}

::: seealso
\-
`Set up a barcode scanner </applications/inventory_and_mrp/barcode/setup/hardware>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} -
`Activate barcode scanners </applications/inventory_and_mrp/barcode/setup/software>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

Once enabled in **Inventory**, you can use the barcode feature in
**Point of Sale** with products that have a barcode number assigned.

## Assign barcodes

### To your products

To use this feature in POS, your products must have barcodes assigned.
To do so, go to
`Point of Sale --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and open a **product form**. Add a barcode number
in the `Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field in the
`General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

### To your employees

To add an identification number to an employee, go to the **Employees**
app and open an **employee form**. Choose an identification number for
your employee and fill in the `PIN Code`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field in the `HR Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.

## Use barcodes

### Scan products

Scan a product\'s barcode using a barcode scanner. Doing so adds it
directly to the cart. To change the quantity, scan a product as many
times as needed, or click `Qty`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
enter the number of products using the keypad.

You can also enter the barcode number manually in the search bar to look
for the product. Then, click it to add it to the cart.

### Log employees

You can also use a barcode scanner to log your employees. To do so,
`restrict access
<pos/employee_login/configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to the
POS and `use barcodes to log your employees in
<pos/employee_login/badge>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} your POS.

# Sales orders

When working in retail, you might need to order products directly from
your Point of sale. Fortunately, Odoo Point of Sale is fully integrated
with Odoo Sales, meaning that you can create a sales order and pay for
it directly from your point of sale.

## Select a sales order

From the **Point of Sale** application, open a new session. Then, click
on `Quotations/Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to get the
complete list of quotations and sales orders created on the sales
application.

![Quotations and sales order button on the Point of Sale interface](sales_order/pos-interface.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To ease finding the right sales order, you can filter that list on the
**customer** or on the **order reference**. You can also set the
customer before clicking on `Quotations/Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to reduce the list to one particular customer.
::::

## Apply a down payment or settle the order

From the list of sales order, select one to make a payment.

![list view of sales orders and quotations](sales_order/list-of-so.png){.align-center}

You can either:

- Settle the order **partially**: after clicking on
  `Apply a down payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, enter the
  percentage of down payment you want the customer to pay. Then, click
  on `ok`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and proceed with the order.
- Settle the order **completely**: click on
  `Settle the order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to pay for the
  total of the sales order.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Once you settle a sales order, the applied down payment is automatically
deducted from the total amount.

# Serial numbers and lots

Working with **serial numbers** and **lots** allows tracking your
products\' movements. When products are tracked, the system identifies
their location based on their last movement.

To enable traceability, go to
`Point of Sale --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, select a product and check the
`Tracking By Unique Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
the `Tracking By Lots`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box in the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![Enable traceability settings](serial_numbers/product-form-traceability.png){.align-center}

## Serial numbers and lots importation

You can import serial numbers in Point of Sale. To do so, select a
**sales order** or a **quotation** containing tracked products. Then,
agree to load the **Lots or Serial Numbers** linked to the
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

![Pop-up window for serial number import](serial_numbers/importing-sn.png){.align-center
width="480px"}

The imported tracking numbers appear below the tracked products. You can
modify them by clicking on the list-view button next to the products.

![Pop-up window for serial number import](serial_numbers/pos-sn-imported.png){.align-center
width="480px"}

::: seealso
\- `../shop/sales_order`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Serial numbers and lots creation

If a tracked product is available in your POS, adding the product to the
cart opens a pop-up window where you can type or scan the product\'s
serial or lot numbers. To add more than one of the same tracked
products, click on **enter** to validate and start a new line.

![adding new serial and lots numbers](serial_numbers/create-change-sn.png){.align-center

\- Changing a tracked product\'s quantity using the numpad turns the
list-view button red. Click on it to add the missing lot and serial
numbers. - `Lot & Serial Number(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
are `required`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on tracked products
but not mandatory. Meaning that not attributing some or any does **not**
prevent from completing the sale.

# Ship later

The **Ship Later** feature allows you to sell products and schedule
delivery at a later date. It is useful, for example, when a product is
out of stock or so voluminous that it requires to be shipped, or if, for
any reason, the customer needs their order to be shipped later, etc.

## Configuration

`Go to the POS settings <configuration/settings>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, scroll down to the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, and enable
`Allow Ship Later`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![settings to enable and configure the ship later feature](ship_later/settings.png)

Once activated, you can:

- Choose the location from where the products are shipped by selecting a
  `Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- Define a `Specific route`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or leave
  this field empty to use the default route.
- Define the `Shipping Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
  select `As soon as possible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if the
  products can be delivered separately or
  `When all products are ready`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
  ship all the products at once.

:::

## Practical application

1.  `Open a session <pos/session-start>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    and make a sale.
2.  On the payment screen, set a customer and select
    `Ship Later`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
3.  On the popup window, set a shipping date and click
    `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to proceed to payment.

# Manage deposits

Requiring fixed deposits is common in many rental scenarios; such as
collecting security deposits.

This document covers the standard options for
`configuring <rental/manage_deposits/config>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`collecting <rental/manage_deposits/product>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `refunding
<rental/manage_deposits/refund>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} deposits
within the **Rentals** app.

## Configuration {#rental/manage_deposits/config}

First, create a *deposit service product* for each rental product that
requires a deposit.

To do so, go to `Rental --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and create a `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} product.

On the product form, give the product a name that indicates it is a
deposit.

::: example
If this deposit service product is intended for the *Digital Camera*
rental product, the name may be entered as [Digital Camera
Deposit]{.title-ref}.
:::

Next, set the `Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Delivered quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and then
assign a `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with the
amount to collect for the deposit. Choose whether or not to include
`Sales Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for this deposit
service product.

Finally, `fa-cloud-upload`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(save)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the deposit service product.

## Collect deposits from an optional product {#rental/manage_deposits/product}

On the rental product\'s form, go to the `Sales`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab and add the `deposit service
product <rental/manage_deposits/config>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
to the `Optional Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Be sure to configure the rental product\'s prices on the
`Rental prices <rental/pricing>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} tab.

With the above configuration, a
`rental order <rental/order>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} can be
created.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

After selecting the rental product in the
`Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, be sure to
`fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Add`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} the deposit service product in the
`Configure your product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up.

The `Configure your product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
only appears if the optional product is set on the rental product.

## Dashboard

Upon opening the *Rental* application, the
`Rental Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard is
revealed.

![Example of the Rental Orders dashboard available in the Odoo Rental application.](rental/rental-orders-dashboard.png){.align-center}

In the default kanban view, all rentals are visible. Each rental card
displays the customer name, the price of the rental, the related sales
order number, along with the status of the rental.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Rental kanban cards that do **not** display a rental status means those
rentals have confirmed quotations, but have not been picked up yet.
::::

On the left sidebar, the `Rental Status`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for each rental can be found. Beneath that, the
`Invoice Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the rentals is
accessible. Clicking any option in the left sidebar filters the
displayed rentals on the dashboard.

## Settings

To configure additional rental delay costs, availability of rental
items, or minimum time of rental, navigate to
`Rental app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![How the Settings page appears in the Odoo Rental application.](rental/rental-settings.png){.align-center}

In the `Rental`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, there are
options to configure `Default Delay Costs`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Default Padding Time`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. There is also the option to activate `Rental
Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Digital Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Default Delay Costs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are
  additional costs for late returns.

- `Default Padding Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} represents
  the minimum amount of time between two rentals.

- `Rental Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} means stock
  deliveries and receipts can be used for rental orders.

- 

  `Digital Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} allows users to upload documents for customers to sign prior to

  :   confirming their rental.

In the `Rent Online`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, there
are options to configure a `Minimal Rental
Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and designate
`Unavailability days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or days during
which pickup and return are not possible.

## Rental products

To view all products that can rented in the database, navigate to
`Rentals app -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. By default, the
`Can be Rented`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} search filter appears
in the search bar.

Each product kanban card displays that product\'s name, rental price,
and product image (if applicable).

::: seealso
`rental/manage_deposits`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Rental pricing {#rental/pricing}

To adjust the rental pricing on a product, go to the
`Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page in the *Rental* app,
then select the desired product or click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to create a new product from scratch.

On the product form, ensure the `Can be Rented`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox is ticked. Then, open the
`Rental prices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![How the Settings page appears in the Odoo Rental application.](rental/rental-prices-tab.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If creating a rental product outside of the *Rental* app, just ensure
the `Can be
Rented`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox is ticked on the
product form. By default, this checkbox is ticked whenever a product is
created directly in the *Rental* application.
::::

### Pricing

Under the `Pricing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
`Rental prices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, designate custom
rental prices and rental periods for the product.

To add pricing for a rental, click `Add a price`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, choose a *pricing period*
(`the unit of duration of the rental`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}) in
the `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, or create a new
pricing period by typing in the name and clicking
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Next, decide whether or not to apply this custom rental price to a
specific `Pricelist`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Lastly, enter the desired `Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
that specific `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

There is no limit to how many pricing lines can be added. Multiple
pricing options for rental products are typically used to give discounts
for customers who agree to longer rental durations.
::::

To delete any rental pricing option, click the
`🗑️ (trash)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, and that row is
deleted.

### Reservations

Under the `Reservations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of
the `Rental prices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, there is the
option to configure additional fines for any
`Extra Hour`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Extra Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that the customer takes
to return a rental.

There is also the option to set a `Security Time`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, expressed in hours, to make the rental product
temporarily unavailable between two rental orders. Such a feature may
prove useful if maintenance or cleaning is required between rentals.

### Price computing

Odoo always uses two rules to compute the price of a product when a
rental order is created:

1.  Only one price line is used.
2.  The cheapest line is selected.

::: exercise
Consider the following rental pricing configuration for a product:

- 1 day: \$100
- 3 days: \$250
- 1 week: \$500

A customer wants to rent this product for eight days. What price will
they pay?

After an order is created, Odoo selects the second line as this is the
cheapest option. The customer has to pay three times \'3 days\' to cover
the rental\'s eight days, for a total of \$750.
:::

## Rental orders {#rental/order}

To create a rental order in the *Rental* app, navigate to
`Rental app --> Orders -->
Orders`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so reveals a blank
rental order form to be filled in accordingly.

![Sample of a filled out rental order available in the Odoo Rental application.](rental/rental-order.png){.align-center}

Start by adding a `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then
configure the desired duration of the rental in the
`Rental period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

To adjust the rental duration, click the first date in the
`Rental period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and select the
range of dates to represent the rental duration from the pop-up calendar
form that appears.

![Sample of a rental period calendar pop-up window in the Odoo Rental application.](rental/rental-period-field-popup.png){.align-center}

Once complete, click `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
calendar pop-up form. Following that, the pop-up form disappears, and
the designated time period of the rental is represented in the
`Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Next, add a rental product in the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, by clicking `Add a
product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and selecting the desired
rental product to add to the form.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If a rental product is added *before* the
`Rental period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field has been
properly configured, the user can *still* adjust the
`Rental period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field accordingly.

Simply select the desired range of dates to represent the duration of
the rental, then click `Update Rental Prices`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

![The update rental prices option that appears in the Odoo Rental application.](rental/rental-update-rental-prices.png){.align-center}

Doing so reveals a `Confirmation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window. If everything is correct, click `Ok`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and Odoo recalculates the rental price accordingly.
::::

Once all the information has been entered correctly on the rental order
form, click the `Send by Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button to send the quotation to the customer, or click the
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to confirm the
order.

## Customer signature {#rental/customer-signature}

Upon confirming a rental order, the `Sign Documents`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button appears. This gives the ability to request the
customer sign a rental agreement, outlining the arrangement between the
company and customer, *before* they pick up the rental product(s).

Such documents can ensure everything is returned on-time and in its
original condition.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Sign Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button/option
**only** appears if the `Digital
Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature has been activated
in the *Rental* application settings. To do so, navigate to
`Rental app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, activate `Digital
Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This feature also requires the
`Sign <../productivity/sign>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} app. If
necessary, Odoo automatically installs it after activating the
`Digital Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting.
::::

To request a customer signature on a rental agreement, select a
confirmed rental order, and click the `Sign Documents`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to reveal a `Sign Documents`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

![The Sign Documents pop-up window that appears in the Odoo Rental application.](rental/sign-documents-popup.png){.align-center}

From here, select the desired document from the
`Document Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Then,
click `Sign Document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so
reveals a `New Signature Request`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window.

![The New Signature Request pop-up window that appears in the Odoo Rental application.](rental/new-signature-request-form.png){.align-center}

Upon confirming the information in the
`New Signature Request`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up form,
click `Sign Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to initiate the
signing process.

A separate page is then revealed, showcasing the document to be signed,
which is accessible to the customer via the customer portal.

Odoo guides the customer through the signing process with clear,
clickable indicators, and allows them to create electronic signatures to
quickly complete the form.

![The adopt your signature pop-up window that appears in the Odoo Rental application.](rental/adopt-signature-popup.png){.align-center}

Once the document has been signed and completed, click the
`Validate & Send Completed
Document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the bottom of the
document.

![The validate and send completed document button in the Odoo Rental application.](rental/validate-send-doc-button.png){.align-center}

Upon clicking the `Validate & Send Completed Document`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, Odoo presents the option to download the signed
document for record-keeping purposes, if necessary.

:::

## Pickup products {#rental/pickup-return}

When a customer picks up the product(s), navigate to the appropriate
rental order, click the `Pickup`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button, and then click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
the `Validate a pickup`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up form
that appears.

Doing so places a `Picked-up`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status
banner on the rental order.

## Return products {#rental/return}

When a customer returns the product(s), navigate to the appropriate
rental order, click the `Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button, and validate the return by clicking `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `Validate a return`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up form that appears.

Doing so places a `Returned`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status
banner on the rental order.

## Print pickup and return receipts

Pickup and return receipts can be printed for customers when they pick
up and/or return rental products.

To print pickup and/or return receipts, navigate to the appropriate
rental order, click the `⚙️ (gear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon to reveal a drop-down menu.

![The pickup and return receipt print option in the Odoo Rental application.](rental/print-pickup-return-receipt.png){.align-center}

From this drop-down menu, hover over the `Print`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option to reveal a sub-menu. Then select
`Pickup and Return Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Odoo generates and downloads a PDF, detailing all information about the
current status of the rented item(s).

# Amazon Connector features

The *Amazon Connector* synchronizes orders between Amazon and Odoo,
which considerably reduces the amount of time spent manually entering
Amazon orders (from the Amazon Seller account) into Odoo. It also allows
users to accurately keep track of Amazon sales in Odoo.

## Supported features

The Amazon Connector is able to:

- Synchronize (Amazon to Odoo) all confirmed orders (both FBA and FBM),
  and their order items, which include:
  - product name, description, and quantity
  - shipping costs for the product
  - gift wrapping charges
- Create any missing partner related to an order in Odoo (contact types
  supported: contact and delivery address).
- Notify Amazon of confirmed shipment in Odoo (FBM) to get paid.
- Synchronize (Odoo to Amazon) all available quantities of your products
  (FBM).
- Support multiple seller accounts.
- Support multiple marketplaces per seller account.

The following table lists capabilities provided by Odoo when using the
Amazon Connector:

The Amazon Connector is designed to synchronize the data of sales
orders. Other actions, such as downloading monthly fees reports,

As of February 19, 2024, in North American marketplaces,
`FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} orders
created with the *Amazon Connector*, do not get the customer\'s name
passed onto the sales/delivery order in Odoo. This is due to the fact
that Amazon now calculates, and remits, sales tax on behalf of sellers.
In other words, personally identifiable customer information is not
transmitted to the seller any longer, after a
`FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} order.

# Amazon order management

## Order synchronization

Orders are automatically fetched from Amazon, and synchronized in Odoo,
at regular intervals.

The synchronization is based on the Amazon status: only orders whose
status has changed since the last synchronization are fetched from
Amazon. This includes changes on either end (Amazon or Odoo).

For *FBA* (Fulfilled by Amazon), only *Shipped* and *Cancelled* orders
are fetched.

For *FBM* (Fulfilled by Merchant), the same is done for *Unshipped* and
*Cancelled* orders. For each synchronized order, a sales order and
customer are created in Odoo (if the customer is not already registered
in the database).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When an order is cancelled in Amazon, and was already synchronized in
Odoo, the corresponding sales order is automatically cancelled in Odoo.
::::

## Force synchronization

In order to force the synchronization of an order, whose status has
**not** changed since the previous synchronization, start by activating
the `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
This includes changes on either end (Amazon or Odoo).

Then, navigate to the Amazon account in Odoo
(`Sales app --> Configuration -->
Settings --> Connectors --> Amazon Sync --> Amazon Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}), and modify the date under
`Orders Follow-up --> Last Order Sync`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Be sure to pick a date that occurs prior to the last status change of
the desired order to synchronize and save. This will ensure
synchronization occurs correctly.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To immediately synchronize the orders of an Amazon account, switch to
`developer mode
<developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, head to the Amazon
account in Odoo, and click `Sync Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The same can be done with pickings by clicking
`Sync Pickings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

## Manage deliveries in FBM

Whenever an FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant) order is synchronized in Odoo, a
picking is instantly created in the *Inventory* app, along with a sales
order and customer record. Then, decide to either ship all the ordered
products to the customer at once, or ship products partially using
backorders.

When a picking related to the order is confirmed, a notification is then
sent to Amazon, who, in turn, notifies the customer that the order (or a
part of it) is on its way.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Amazon requires users to provide a tracking reference with each
delivery. This is needed to assign a carrier.

If the carrier doesn\'t automatically provide a tracking reference, one
must be set manually. This rule applies to all Amazon marketplaces.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If the chosen carrier isn\'t supported by Odoo, a carrier with the same
name can still be created (e.g. create a carrier named
[easyship]{.title-ref}). The name used is **not** case sensitive, but be
mindful to avoid typos. If there are typos, Amazon will **not**
recognize them. Next, create a delivery carrier named [Self
Delivery]{.title-ref} to inform Amazon that the user will make the
deliveries. Even with this route, a tracking reference still **must** be
entered. Remember, the customer is notified by email about the delivery,
and the carrier, along with the tracking reference, are displayed in the
email to the customer.
::::

`../../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/third_party_shipper`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

### Manage errors when synchronizing deliveries {#manage/manage_delivery_errors}

Sometimes, Amazon can fail to correctly process all the information sent
by Odoo. In this case, Odoo sends an email listing all the shipments
that failed and the errors Amazon sent with them. In addition, these
shipments are flagged with a
`Synchronization with Amazon failed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tag.

Usually, the error can be corrected directly in the Amazon backend or in
Odoo. If the problem is corrected in Odoo, synchronize the shipment
again using the `Retry Amazon Sync`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It might happen that Odoo receives a notification from Amazon saying
that some delivery information was not processed, but without specifying
which shipments were affected. In that case, all the shipments in an
unknown state will be treated as if they failed to synchronize. Once
Odoo receives a notification from Amazon saying that a shipment was
processed, its tag will change to
`Synchronized with Amazon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To speed
up this process, on your Amazon account, click on
`Sync Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to manually synchronize
these orders, or click on `Recover Order`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and enter the relevant Amazon Order Reference.
::::

## Follow deliveries in FBA

When an FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) order is synchronized in Odoo, a stock
move is recorded in the *Inventory* app for each sales order item. That
way, it\'s saved in the system.

Inventory managers can access these stock moves by navigating to
`Inventory app -->
Reporting --> Moves History`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

For FBA orders, the stock move is automatically created in Odoo by the
Amazon connector, thanks to the shipping status of Amazon. When sending
new products to Amazon, the user should manually create a picking
(delivery order) to transfer these products from their warehouse to the
Amazon location.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To follow *Amazon (FBA)* stock in Odoo, make an inventory adjustment
after replenishing stock. An automated replenishment from reordering
rules can also be triggered on the Amazon location.
::::

The Amazon location is configurable by accessing the Amazon account
managed in Odoo. To access Amazon accounts in Odoo navigate to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings -->
Connectors --> Amazon Sync --> Amazon Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

All accounts of the same company use the same Amazon location, by
default. However, it is possible to follow the stock filtered by
marketplace.

To do that, first remove the marketplace, where the desired stock to
follow separately can be found, from the list of synchronized
marketplaces, which can be found by navigating to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings --> Connectors --> Amazon Sync --> Amazon
Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Next, create another registration for this account, and remove all
marketplaces\-\-- **except** the marketplace this is desired to be
isolated from the others.

Lastly, assign another stock location to the second registration of the
account.

## Invoice and register payments

### Issue invoices

Due to Amazon\'s policy of not sharing customer email addresses, it is
**not** possible to send invoices directly to Amazon customers from
Odoo. However, it **is** possible to manually upload the generated
invoices from Odoo to the Amazon back-end.

Additionally, for B2B clients, it is currently required to manually
retrieve VAT numbers from the Amazon back-end **before** creating an
invoice in Odoo.

### Register payments

Since customers pay Amazon as an intermediary, creating a dedicated
*Bank* journal (e.g. named [Amazon Payments]{.title-ref}), with a
dedicated *Bank and Cash* intermediary account is recommended.

Additionally, as Amazon makes a single monthly payment, selecting all
the invoices linked to a single payment is necessary when registering
payments.

To do that, use the appropriate `Journal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dedicated to Amazon payments, and select
`Batch Deposit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as the
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then, select all the generated payments, and click
`Actions --> Create batch payment
--> Validate`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

This same action can be performed with vendor bills from Amazon
dedicated to commissions.

When the balance is received in the bank account at the end of the
month, and the bank statements are recorded, credit the Amazon
intermediary account by the amount received.
::::

## Follow Amazon sales in sales reporting

On the Amazon account profile in Odoo, a sales team is set under the
`Order Follow-up`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

This gives quick access to important metrics related to sales reporting.
By default, the Amazon account\'s sales team is shared between all of
the company\'s accounts.

If desired, the sales team on the account can be changed for another, in
order to perform a separate reporting for the sales of this account.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

It is also possible to perform reporting on a per-marketplace basis.

First, remove the desired marketplace from the list of synchronized
marketplaces.

To access the list of synchronized marketplaces in Odoo, navigate to
`Sales app
--> Configuration --> Settings --> Connectors --> Amazon Sync --> Amazon Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Then, create another registration for this account, and remove all other
marketplaces **except** the one to isolate.

Lastly, assign another sales team to one of the two registrations of the
account.

# Amazon Connector configuration

Odoo allows users to register an Amazon seller account in the database,
but the user **must** have a paid Amazon Seller account prior to
completing the configuration.

Set up a paid Seller account on Amazon by first logging into the Amazon
platform, and navigating to
`Account \& Lists --> Start a Selling Account`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} from the drop-down menu located in the header
section.

Then on the `Sell with Amazon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page,
follow the sign-up process and finally proceed to follow the
instructions below to register and link that Amazon Seller account in
Odoo.

::: seealso
[Sell with Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=12766669011)
:::

## Connect Amazon Seller account to Odoo

::: {#amazon/setup}
To connect an Amazon Seller account in Odoo, navigate to `Sales app -->
Configuration --> Settings --> Connectors section`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, activate the `Amazon Sync`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} feature, and click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
:::

Then, return to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings --> Connectors section`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click on the
`Amazon Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} link under the
`Amazon Sync`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting.

![The Amazon Accounts link beneath the Amazon Sync settings in Odoo Sales.](setup/amazon-accounts-link-setting.png){.align-center}

Doing so reveals a separate `Amazon Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page. From here, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to create and link a new Amazon account.

On the blank `Amazon Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form
page, start by choosing a name for the account (e.g. [American
Marketplace]{.title-ref}). Then, in the `Credentials`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, select the marketplace on which the seller account
was initially created from the `Home Marketplace`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu.

![A typical Amazon Account form page in the Odoo Sales application.](setup/amazon-accounts-form-page.png){.align-center}

After saving, the field in the `Credentials`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab is replaced by a `Link with
Amazon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![A typical Amazon Account form page and Link with Amazon button in Odoo Sales.](setup/amazon-accounts-form-link-button.png){.align-center}

Clicking that button redirects to either the Amazon login page, or
directly to the required consent page, if the user is already logged in
to Amazon.

On the login page, log in to the desired Amazon seller account.

On the consent page, confirm that Amazon is allowed to give Odoo access
to the account and related data.

Upon confirmation, Amazon returns the user to Odoo, and the account has
been registered.

With the Amazon account successfully registered, the marketplaces
available to this specific account are synchronized with Odoo and listed
under the `Marketplaces`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

If desired, remove items from the list of synchronized marketplaces to
disable synchronization.

## Amazon orders in Odoo

When an Amazon order is synchronized, up to three line items are created
on the sales order in Odoo. Each one represents a product sold on
Amazon: one for the product that was sold on Amazon Marketplace, one for
the shipping charges (if any), and one for the gift wrapping charges (if
any).

::: {#amazon/matching}
The selection of a database product for a sales order item is done by
matching its `Internal Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (a
customizable product reference idenifier in Odoo, like
[FURN001]{.title-ref}) with the Amazon *SKU* for marketplace items, the
Amazon *Shipping Code* for delivery charges, and the Amazon *Gift
Wrapping* code for gift wrapping charges.
:::

For marketplace products, pairings are saved as *Amazon Offers*, which
are listed under the `Offers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button on the account form.

![The Amazon Offers smart button on the account form in Odoo Sales.](setup/amazon-offers-button.png){.align-center}

Offers are automatically created when the pairing is established, and
they\'re used for subsequent orders to lookup SKUs. If no offer with a
matching SKU is found, `the internal reference is
used instead <amazon/matching>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

It\'s possible to force the pairing of a marketplace item with a
specific product, by changing either the product or the SKU of an offer
to ensure they match. The offer can be manually created if it was not
automatically done yet.

This is useful if the internal reference is not used as the SKU, or if
the product sells under different conditions.
::::

If no database product with a matching internal reference is found for a
given Amazon SKU or gift wrapping code, then a default database product,
*Amazon Sale*, is used. The same is done with the default product
*Amazon Shipping* if no database product is found for a given Amazon
shipping code.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To modify default products, activate the
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
navigate to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings --> Connectors --> Amazon Sync -->
Default Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
::::

## Product tax configuration

To allow for tax reporting of Amazon sales with Odoo, the taxes applied
to the sales order items are those set on the product, or determined by
the fiscal position.

Make sure to have the correct taxes set on your products in Odoo, or
have it done by a fiscal position, to avoid discrepancies in the
subtotals between *Amazon Seller Central* and Odoo.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

As Amazon does not necessarily apply the same taxes as those configured
in Odoo, it may happen that order totals differ by a few cents between
Odoo and *Amazon Seller Central*. Those differences can be resolved with
a write-off when reconciling the payments in Odoo.
::::

## Add a new marketplace {#amazon/add-new-marketplace}

All marketplaces are supported by the Amazon Connector. To add a new
marketplace, proceed as follows:

1.  Activate the `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
2.  Go to
    `Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings --> Connectors --> Amazon Sync -->
    Amazon Marketplaces`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
3.  Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a new
    marketplace record.
4.  Enter the Marketplace ID in the `API Idenifier`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field, and select the `Amazon
    Region`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for your marketplace as
    described in the [Amazon Documentation for marketplace IDs and
    regions](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/marketplace-ids),
    and the `Seller Central URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
    described in the [Amazon Documentation for seller central
    URLs](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/seller-central-urls).
5.  Set the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the record to
    [Amazon.\<country code\>]{.title-ref} to easily retrieve it (e.g.
    [Amazon.se]{.title-ref}). The `API Identifier`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, the `Region`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    and the `Seller
    Central URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields should
    respectively hold the *Marketplace ID*, the selected Amazon region,
    and the *Seller Central URL* values from the Amazon Documentation.
6.  Once the marketplace is saved, update the Amazon Account
    configuration by going to
    `Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings --> Connectors --> Amazon Sync -->
    Amazon Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
7.  Select the account on which to use the new marketplace, go to the
    `Marketplaces`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and click on
    `Update available marketplaces`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
    An animation should confirm the success of the operation. Newly
    added marketplaces are automatically added to the list of
    synchronized marketplaces. If the new marketplace is not added to
    the list, it means that it is either incompatible or unavailable for
    the seller account.

# Commissions

Commissions are a powerful tool to motivate sales team members. They
incentivize performance, boost productivity, and encourage healthy
competition. The *Commissions* feature in Odoo\'s **Sales** application
provides a way to reward salespeople or sales teams based on their
performance. This feature supports the creation of flexible, measurable
commission structures that align with business goals, whether that means
driving revenue, volume, profit, or recurring contracts.

## Configuration

To enable the *Commissions* feature, navigate to
`Sales app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Scroll to the
`Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and tick the
`Commissions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox. Then, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so causes a new
`Commissions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu to appear in the
menu bar. To create a new commission plan, navigate to `Commissions -->
Comission Plans`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Commission plan structure

Each commission plan is comprised of several components:

- `Based on`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Determines whether
  commissions are awarded based on progress toward
  `Targets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Achievements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `per`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Indicates whether the plan
  applies to individual salespeople or an entire sales team
- `Target Frequency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Sets how often
  targets reset: **Monthly**, **Quarterly**, or **Yearly**.
- `Achievements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Determines what is
  being measured toward commissions.

![A new commission plan detail form.](commissions/new-commission-plan.png)

### Target-based commission plans

In a *Target* based commission plan, commissions are awarded based on
the percentage of sales targets reached. Target based plans are ideal
for setting clear, measurable goals, such as invoicing a specific amount
in sales per quarter, then rewarding sales people progressively based on
how close they come to reaching or exceeding that goal.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Target based plans differ from *Achievement* based plans because they
are based on reaching a fixed, predefined goal. They focus on goal-based
incentives and performance milestones.
::::

To configure a new target based commission plan, navigate to the
`Sales app -->
Commissions --> Commission Plans`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Click in the `Based on`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu and select `Targets`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, select an option in the `per`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

In the `On Target Commission`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
set the payout amount for reaching [100%]{.title-ref} of the target.
Update the `Effective Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields
to confirm the dates for this plan. Then, update the
`Target Frequency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field based on how
often the targets should be set and evaluated.

- *Monthly*: short term goals with frequent payouts.
- *Quarterly*: aligns with business cycles and provides mid-range
  objectives.
- *Yearly*: long term sales goals for strategic planning.

After the `Target Frequency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
updated, the `Targets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab updates
with a list of the appropriate time frame. For each
`Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, enter a
`Target`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} goal.

On the `Achievements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, add one or
more `Achievement metric
<sales/commissions/achievement-metric>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
for this plan by clicking `Add a new achievement`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Click the `Sales People`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to
assign this plan to the appropriate staff. Click either
`Add a new Sales Person`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add them
individually, or `Add Multiple
Salespersons`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to bulk add several at
once.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Add Multiple Salespersons`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button is only available if
`../../general/developer_mode`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} is active.
::::

### Levels

To provide additional incentive, *commission levels* can be added to
*Target* based plans. These tiers allow salespeople to earn varying
commission amounts based on their performance levels. Levels can start
at [0%]{.title-ref} and increase incrementally. This allows for
salespeople to earn commission even if they do not achieve
[100%]{.title-ref} of the target, as well as the ability to achieve over
[100%]{.title-ref} of the target. Commission levels can be set from the
`Commissions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab when creating a
commission plan.

If no levels are added above 100%, salespeople are **not** able to earn
above the stated commission.

::: example
In the plan below, the levels start at [0%]{.title-ref}, and continue
until [300%]{.title-ref}. If a salesperson exceeds [100%]{.title-ref} of
the expected target, their expected payout continues to increase up to
[300%]{.title-ref}.

![An example of commission levels, with levels above 100 percent.](commissions/commission-levels.png)
:::

### Achievement-based commission plans

In a *Achievement* based commission plan, salespeople earn a percentage
of their invoice value as commission. Target based plans are ideal for
rewarding sales activity consistently, regardless of specific goals. For
example, offering a [5%]{.title-ref} commission on all invoiced amounts,
regardless of how much is sold.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Achievement based plans differ from *Target* based plans because they
are calculated based on actual achievements using a flat, consistent
rate. They are beneficial for ongoing, non-goal based compensation
plans.
::::

To configure a new target based commission plan, navigate to the
`Sales app -->
Commissions --> Commission Plans`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Click in the `Based on`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down and select `Achievements`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, select an option in the `per`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

Update the `Effective Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields
to confirm the dates for this plan. Then, update the
`Target Frequency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field based on how
often the targets should be set and evaluated.

On the `Achievements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, add one or
more `Achievement metric
<sales/commissions/achievement-metric>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
for this plan by clicking `Add a new achievement`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Click the `Sales People`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to
assign this plan to the appropriate staff. Click either
`Add a new Sales Person`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add them
individually, or `Add Multiple
Salespersons`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to bulk add several at
once.

### Achievements {#sales/commissions/achievement-metric}

Performance can be measured in several ways in performance plans. These
are configured in the `Achievements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab of each plan.

- `Amount Sold`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total value of
  sales orders (SOs).
- `Amount Invoiced`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total value
  of confirmed invoices.
- `Quantity Sold`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total number
  of units sold via `SOs (Sales Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
- `Quantity Invoiced`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total
  number of units invoiced.
- `Margin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the profit margin
  (selling price minus cost price).
- `MRR`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the new *Monthly Recurring
  Revenue* from subscription sales. this option is **only** available if
  the `Subscriptions <../../sales/subscriptions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} app is installed.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Regardless of what the plan is `Based on`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, each plan needs both *Achievements* and *Targets*
configured.
::::

## Plan approval

After confirming the details of the new plan, click
`Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This moves the plan from
the `Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage into the
`Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Commissions plans in the `Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
stage **cannot** be edited. To edit an approved plan, it must first be
`Reset to Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

After a plan is approved, Odoo automatically tracks performance and
calculates commissions based on the established parameters.

# Gelato

Gelato is a global print-on-demand platform that integrates with Odoo to
sync product catalogs and automate order fulfillment.

Connecting Gelato\'s services with Odoo\'s **Sales** and **eCommerce**
apps enables the following:

- Sync Odoo sales orders with Gelato for automated order fulfillment
- Create and manage Gelato products within Odoo; supports product
  variant and image sync
- Configure delivery options in Odoo and receive order updates via
  webhooks.

## Configuration

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The company information (*Company name* and *Billing address*) in the
Gelato account *must* match the company information in the Odoo database
in order for sales orders to be confirmed and sent to Gelato for
fulfillment.

![Company information in Gelato.](gelato/gelato-company.png)

![Company information in Odoo.](gelato/odoo-company.png)
::::

### Configure API keys and webhooks in Gelato

Before configuring the Gelato connector in Odoo, first obtain API
credentials and webhooks from the Gelato account.

API connectors enable Odoo **Sales** to send and receive data from
Gelato for order processing, while webhooks provide real-time updates on
order status and shipment tracking.

#### API Key

An API Key is a unique authentication token that allows Odoo to securely
communicate with Gelato\'s API, enabling order transmission, status
updates, and data synchronization.

After logging into Gelato, click `fa-code`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Developer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the left
menu bar. From here, click on `API keys`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. In the new page, click the
`Add API Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to open a new
API key form. Type in a name, then click `Create Key`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Copy the generated API key using `Copy to Clipboard`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Newly generated API key in the Gelato platform.](gelato/gelato-api-key.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Copy the API key and store it somewhere safe and secure before leaving
this page. Once the page is refreshed or exited, the key will not be
available to copy.

If the key cannot be copied or is lost, return to the
`API key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page and start over,
creating a new API key.
::::

#### Webhook

A webhook is an automated notification system that instantly updates
Odoo when Gelato processes, ships, or delivers an order, ensuring
real-time tracking and minimal manual intervention.

To create a webhook, go to `Developer --> Webhooks`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} under the `Developer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu in the left menu bar. In the new page,
click `Add Webhook`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open a
`Create Webhook`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form.

The webhook form requires several specific configurations:

- `URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This tells Gelato where to
  send the order updates in Odoo. Copy and paste the Odoo database URL
  with the additional suffix [/gelato/webhook]{.title-ref}.

  ::: example
  [https://stealthywood.odoo.com/gelato/webhook]{.title-ref}
  :::

- `Events`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Click into the field and
  select `order_status_updated`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  Selecting `order_status_updated`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  ensures Odoo receives order changes automatically.

- `Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Click into the field and
  select the `HTTP Post`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, as
  this is the request method used to send data from Gelato to Odoo.

- Tick the checkbox next to
  `I want to take Authorization to this webhook`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.

- `Header Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: In this field, type
  in [signature]{.title-ref} to match the field in Odoo.

- Click `Generate Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to generate a
  `Header Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- Click `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to complete this
  webhook configuration.

![Newly configured webhook in the Gelato platform.](gelato/gelato-webhook.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Copy and paste the API key and webhook on a notepad before tabbing out
of the Gelato webpage as backup.
::::

### Configure Gelato connector in Odoo

In Odoo, navigate to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then scroll to the `Connectors`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section. Enable the `Gelato`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} connector by ticking the checkbox. Next, paste the
newly generated API keys and webhook secret key into their respective
fields. Once saved, Gelato is available in Odoo **Sales** and
**eCommerce** products.

## Synchronizing Gelato products with Odoo Sales

It is recommended to have products already configured in Gelato before
configuring them in Odoo. To get the product ID in Gelato, navigate to
the `Templates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page from the side
bar menu. Select which product to synchronize in Odoo, then hover over
the product card to reveal the `fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(vertical ellipsis)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
menu icon. Click the menu icon, then click
`Copy Template ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to copy the
product template ID to the clipboard.

::: seealso
[Start selling products with Gelato: Quick & easy
setup](https://www.gelato.com/blog/get-started-with-gelato-creating-products)
:::

### Odoo Sales product

To create a product in Odoo that matches the Gelato product, navigate to
`Sales app
--> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
select `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a new product
form. Type in the product `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
then navigate to the `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
Find the `Gelato`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, then click
into the `Template Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
and paste the copied template ID from the Gelato product. Finally, click
`Synchronize`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Successful synchronization pulls the Gelato product variant options into
the newly configured Odoo product.

In the new `Print Images`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
click the `default`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} marker to set a
default product image. Click the `fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(edit)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and select
the product image file to upload, then `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Print Images`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field *must* be
configured on all Gelato products and their respective product
variations before they can be ordered.
::::

### Product variants

To view and edit the newly synchronized product variants, navigate to
the `Attributes &
Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, which will have the
variants pulled from the Gelato product configuration. Click the
`Configure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to edit and
configure the variant images, delivery methods, additional pricing, etc.

### Order a Gelato product from Odoo

Once synchronized, Gelato products are available to order in Odoo
through `sales quotations
<sales_quotations>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} or on the
**eCommerce** store. Gelato delivery options are automatically
synchronized upon API and webhook configuration.

To add Gelato delivery, click `Add shipping`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the sales order. Select
`Standard Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Express Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Shipping Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, then click
`Get rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Once the quotation is confirmed, it becomes an active sales order, and
the order is sent to Gelato for fulfillment. Once a sales order is sent
from Odoo to Gelato, Gelato processes the order, produces the product at
the nearest fulfillment center, and ships it directly to the
end-customer.

When creating a sales order for Gelato products in the database, only
Gelato products can be added to the same sales order. Multivendor orders
are not available with the Gelato connector at this time.

# Down payments

A down payment is an initial up-front payment made during the
confirmation of a sales transaction. With a down payment, the buyer pays
a portion of the total amount owed while agreeing to pay the remaining
amount at a later date. In turn, the seller provides goods or services
to the buyer upon or after accepting the down payment, trusting that the
remaining amount will be paid later on.

In the Odoo **Sales** app, down payments can be customized to fit the
needs of each individual sales transaction.

## Create invoices

When a sales order is confirmed, the option to create an invoice becomes
available via the `Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button. When clicked, a `Create invoice(s)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up appears.

![Create invoice(s) pop-up form that appears in Odoo Sales.](down_payment/create-invoices-popup-form.png)

:::: note

Invoices are automatically created as drafts so they can be reviewed
before validation.
::::

On the `Create invoice(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up,
there are 3 options to choose from in the
`Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field:

- `Regular invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Down payment (percentage)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Down payment (fixed amount)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

## Initial down payment request

On the `Create invoice(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, the down payment options are:

- `Down payment (percentage)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Down payment (fixed amount)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

Select a down payment option and set the desired payment, either as a
percentage or a fixed amount, in the
`Down Payment Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Once all fields are filled in, click the
`Create Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. Upon clicking
this button, Odoo reveals the `Customer Invoice Draft`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

If an `Invalid Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} error
appears, double-check that the `invoicing policy
<invoicing_policy>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} is configured
correctly. In some cases, for example, the invoicing policy is
configured to require delivery before sending an invoice.
::::

In the `Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
`Customer Invoice Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the down
payment that was just configured in the
`Create invoice(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up form
appears under a new `Down Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section.

## Example: requesting a 50% down payment {#sales/invoicing/50-percent-down-payments}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The following example involves a 50% amount down payment on a
(`Cabinet with Doors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) with
`Ordered quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as the
`Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Cabinet with doors product form showcasing various details and fields.](down_payment/cabinet-product-details.png)
::::

Navigate to `Sales app --> New`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and add a `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the
quotation. Then, click `Add a product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, and select the `Cabinet with Doors`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} product. When the order is confirmed (via the
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button), the quotation
turns into a sales order. Once this occurs, create and view the invoice
by clicking `Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Cabinet with doors sales order that\'s been confirmed in the Odoo Sales application.](down_payment/cabinet-sales-orders-confirmed.png)

Next, on the `Create invoice(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window that appears, select `Down
payment (percentage)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and type
[50]{.title-ref} in the `Down Payment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Income Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} attached to the
`Down payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be changed. For
more information, check out the documentation on
`income account modification on down payments
<sales/invoicing/income-account-modification>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. A `Down payment Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
can also be set on a product category. If set, this account is
prioritized for future down payments.
::::

Lastly, click `Create Draft Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to create and view the invoice draft, which includes the down payment
under the `Down Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of
the `Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. From there,
the invoice can be confirmed and posted by clicking
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Confirming the invoice
changes the status from `Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Posted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. It also reveals a new
series of buttons at the top of the page.

![A sample draft invoice with down payment mentioned in Odoo Sales.](down_payment/draft-invoice-sample.png)

From those buttons, the payment can be registered by clicking
`Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so reveals a
`Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up form, which is
auto-populated with the necessary information. Confirm the information
provided is correct, and make any necessary adjustments. When ready,
click the `Create Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![Showcase of the Pay pop-up window with create payment button.](down_payment/register-payment-pop-up-window.png)

After clicking `Create Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, Odoo
reveals the customer invoice, now with a green
`In Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner in the upper-right
corner, depending on how the database has configured and if manual
confirmation of payments is required.

![Customer Invoice with a green Paid banner located in the upper-right corner.](down_payment/customer-invoice-green-payment-banner.png)

On the sales order, a new `Down Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section is present in the `Order
Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, along with the down
payment that was just invoiced and posted. When the customer wants to
pay the remaining amount of the order, another invoice must be created.

![The down payments section in the order lines tab of a sales order.](down_payment/down-payments-section-order-lines.png)

Next, click the `Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button. On the `Create invoice(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window that appears, there is a new field:
`Already invoiced`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `Amount to
invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The deduct down payment option on the Create invoice(s) pop up in Odoo Sales.](down_payment/create-invoices-pop-up-already-invoiced.png)

If the remaining amount is ready to be paid, select the
`Regular Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. Odoo will
create an invoice for the exact amount needed to complete the total
payment, as indicated in the `Amount to invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

Once ready, click `Create Draft Invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Doing so reveals another `Customer
Invoice Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, listing all the
invoices for that specific sales order in the
`Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Each invoice
line item displays all the necessary information related to each
invoice.

To complete the flow, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to change the status of the invoice from `Draft`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to `Posted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then,
click `Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
`Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form appears, with all fields
auto-populated with the necessary information, including the remaining
amount left to be paid on the order.

![The second Pay pop-up form in Odoo sales.](down_payment/second-register-payment-popup.png)

After confirming that information, click
`Create Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so reveals
the final `Customer Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with a
green `In Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner in the upper-right
corner, depending on how the database has configured and if manual
confirmation of payments is required. Upon returning to the sales order,
both down payments are present in the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.

![The second down payment invoice with Paid banner in Odoo Sales.](down_payment/final-sales-order.png)

At this point, the flow is now complete. This flow is also possible with
the `Fixed
amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} down payment option.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If a down payment is used with a product that has a
`Delivered quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} invoicing
policy, and the cost of the product exceeds the 50% down payment, a
regular invoice is created. However, for products that cost less than
the 50% down payment, the down payments will not be able to be deducted
when it comes time to invoice the customer. This is because the
product(s) would have to be delivered *before* creating the final
invoice due to Odoo not allowing negative totals for invoices. If
nothing has been delivered, a `Credit Note`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is created, which cancels the draft invoice that was
created after the down payment.

To utilize the `Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option,
the **Inventory** application must be installed in order to confirm the
delivery. Otherwise, the delivered quantity can be entered manually
directly on the sales order.
::::

## Example: requesting a 100% down payment {#sales/invoicing/100-percent-down-payments}

Requesting a 100% down payment is similar to requesting a
`50% down payment
<sales/invoicing/50-percent-down-payments>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, but with fewer steps.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

A 100% down payment is not the same as a full payment of the sales
order. A sales order paid through the regular invoice process will not
allow any additional invoices to be generated and will not display the
`Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the Sales
Order. Instead, following this example will cause the
`Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to be
displayed on the Sales Order. This is because the system expects another
invoice to be created after the down payment to complete payment of the
sales order.
::::

The *Solar Panel Installation* product is being used in this example.

To configure a 100% down payment, navigate to
`Sales app --> New`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and add a
`Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the quote. Next, click
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the `Order
Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and select the [Solar
Panel Installation]{.title-ref} product. Upon clicking the
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, the quotation turns
into a sales order. At that point, an invoice can now be created by
clicking `Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
top-left corner. On the `Create invoice(s)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window that appears, select
`Down payment (percentage)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and type
[100]{.title-ref} in the `Down Payment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

![The Down payment (percentage) option selected with 100% set as the Down Payment.](down_payment/100p-down-payment-percentage.png)

Next, click `Create Draft Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
create an invoice draft. This will also bring the draft invoice into
view, which includes the `Down payment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} under the `Down
Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
`Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. The invoice can
now be confirmed and posted by clicking `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Confirming the invoice changes the status from
`Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to `Posted`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. It also reveals a new series of buttons at the top of
the page.

The payment can be registered by clicking the `Pay`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. This brings up the `Pay`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up form, which is auto-populated with the necessary
information. When ready, click the `Create Payment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

After clicking `Create Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, Odoo
reveals the customer invoice, now with a green
`In Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner in the upper-right
corner, depending on how the database has configured and if manual
confirmation of payments is required. The process is now complete, and
the 100% down payment has been successfully applied.

## Income account modification on down payments {#sales/invoicing/income-account-modification}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To change or adjust the income account attached to down payments, the
**Accounting** app must be installed. With the **Accounting** app
installed, the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column
becomes available on the draft invoice.
::::

Navigate to the invoice to be modified by going to
`Sales app --> Orders --> Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Open an order, then click the
`Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button. Open an
invoice, click the drop-down arrow on the entry in the
`Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column and click
`Search more...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to bring up the
`Search: Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form. In this form,
a different account can be chosen from the list of pre-existing
accounts. A new account can also be created by clicking the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

# Reinvoice expenses to customers

While working on a project for a client, employees often have to spend
their own money on various expenses related to the project.

For example, an employee may need to use their own money to pay for a
hotel, while they provide an on-site service for a client. As a company,
this expense should be reinvoiced to the customer. With Odoo, these
kinds of expenses can quickly be reinvoiced to the customer related to
the project.

## Expenses application

To be able to reinvoice a customer for an expense, the *Expenses*
application **must** be installed.

To install the *Expenses* application, navigate to
`main Odoo dashboard --> Apps`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and click `Install`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the *Expenses*
application block. When clicked, Odoo installs the application,
refreshes the page, and returns to the main Odoo dashboard.

## Add expenses to sales orders

To begin, have a sales order confirmed in the *Sales* app to which a
reinvoiced expense can be added. Or, create a new sales order from
scratch. To do that, navigate to the `Sales
app --> New`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Doing so reveals a
blank quotation form.

Then, add a `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and add a
product to the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, by
clicking `Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Next,
select a product from the drop-down menu.

Lastly, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm
the sales order.

![This is how a confirmed sales order looks in the Odoo Sales application.](expense/confirmed-sales-order.png){.align-center}

With the sales order confirmed, it\'s time to create an expense.

To do that, navigate to the *Expenses* application, by going to
`main Odoo dashboard
--> Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Then, from the *Expenses* dashboard, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to reveal a blank expenses form.

![A blank expenses form in the Odoo Expenses application.](expense/blank-expenses-form.png){.align-center}

On the expenses form, add a `Description`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to easily reference the expense.

Then, in the `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select
one of the following options from the drop-down menu:

- `Communication`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: any form of
  communication related to a project/order.
- `Others`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: expense that doesn\'t fit
  into any other categories.
- `Meals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: any form of meal costs
  related to a project/order.
- `Gifts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: any form of gift costs
  related to a project/order.
- `Mileage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: any form of mileage
  (gas) costs related to project/order.
- `Travel \& Accommodation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: any
  travel or accommodation costs related to a project/order.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

New expense categories can be created from an expense form, by clicking
the `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field drop-down menu,
selecting `View All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and clicking
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
`Search:Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

![The Search:Category expenses pop-up window from a blank expenses form in Odoo Expenses.](expense/expense-category-pop-up.png){.align-center}
::::

For this sample workflow, which will reinvoice a customer for a brief
hotel stay, the `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for this
example is `[TRANS \& ACC] Travel \& Accommodation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The following example requires the *Sales*, *Accounting*, and *Expense*
apps to view/modify all the fields mentioned during the workflow.
::::

Beneath the `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, enter
in the amount to be expensed in the `Total`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

Next, designate if there are any `Included taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If a
preconfigured tax amount is selected from the
`Included taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, Odoo
auto-calculates the taxed amount, based on the amount entered in the
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Then, choose which `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} was
responsible for the expense, and choose an option in the
`Paid By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field:
`Employee (to reimburse)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In this case, our employee paid for the hotel with their own money, so
the `Employee (to
reimburse)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is chosen.

On the right-hand side of the expenses form, the option to add a
`Bill Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is available.
Beneath that, the auto-populated `Expense Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields
are available.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Expense Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field can be modified, if
needed.
::::

Next, in the `Customer to Reinvoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, click the blank field to reveal a drop-down menu. From this
drop-down menu, select the appropriate sales order to which this expense
should be attached. This field **must** be filled, in order to reinvoice
a customer for an expense.

Lastly, the option to modify the
`Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields are available. These
fields are *not* required to complete a reinvoiced expense to a
customer, but are available to modify, if needed.

Also, at the bottom of the expense form, there is a
`Notes...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, wherein any notes
related to this expense can be added, if needed.

![A filled out expenses form in the Odoo Expenses application.](expense/filled-in-expense-form.png){.align-center}

At the top of the expense form, there are buttons to
`Attach Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Create
Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Split Expense`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If there is a physical or digital receipt that should be attached to the
expense, click `Attach Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If the cost of this expense needs to be split, click
`Split Expense`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This feature can be
used for a number of reasons (spitting expense with another employee, to
accommodate different tax rates, etc.).

If neither of these options are necessary, click
`Create Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to lock in the
expense report that was just configured.

Doing so reveals an `Expense Report Summary`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for the new expense.

![An expense report summary in the Odoo Expenses application.](expense/expense-report-summary-form.png){.align-center}

Here, once the details related to the expense have been confirmed, click
`Submit to
Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This sends the expense
report to the approving manager, who will review the expense.

The manager in charge of reviewing and approving the expense will
inspect the details related to the expense, and if there are no issues,
they will click the `Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
--- which *only* appears on the manager\'s view of the
`Expense Report Summary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that\'s been
submitted to the manager by the employee.

![An expense report summary that a manager will approve with an Approve button.](expense/expense-report-summary-manager-approve.png){.align-center}

Once approved, the buttons at the top of the
`Expense Report Summary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} change once
again. At this point, the buttons at the top of the
`Expense Report Summary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are: `Post
Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Report in Next Payslip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and `Reset to
Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![An expense report summary with post journal entries button at the top of the form.](expense/expense-report-summary-manager-post-journal.png){.align-center}

When the manager is satisfied with the
`Expense Report Summary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, they\'ll
click `Post Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Upon clicking `Post Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
that button disappears, and the `Analytic
Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column in the
`Expense`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab is filled with the
sales order that was initially configured to the expense in the
`Customer to Reinvoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

By default, the `Customer to Reinvoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field is enabled for the `[TRANS &
ACC] Travel & Accommodation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`[COMM] Communication`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`[FOOD] Meals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`[MIL] Mileage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} expense category.

It should be noted that **not** all of the default expense categories
that come installed with the *Expenses* application have reinvoicing
policies activated. The setting may have to be manually activated.

To do that, navigate to
`Expenses app --> Configuration --> Expenses Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to view a list of all expense categories in the
database.

Look in the `Re-Invoice Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column to see which selections have been made for each expense category.

![The Re-Invoice Expenses column on the Expense Categories page in the Odoo Expenses app.](expense/expense-categories-page.png){.align-center}

To modify an expense category, click the
`fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(right arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, to reveal that
specific expense from.

Under the `Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, in the
`Re-Invoice Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select
either `At cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Sales price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Re-Invoice Expenses field on an Expense Category form in the Odoo Expenses app.](expense/reinvoice-expenses-field.png){.align-center}

## Reinvoice expense

With those steps completed, it\'s time to return to the sales order to
complete the reinvoice of the expense to the customer.

To do that, navigate to
`main Odoo dashboard --> Sales app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the appropriate sales order that
should be reinvoiced for the expense.

On the sales form, the newly-configured expense is now in the
`Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, with its
`Delivered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column filled in, and
ready to be invoiced.

![A sales order with the configured expense ready to be invoiced in the Order Lines tab.](expense/sales-order-with-expense-order-lines.png){.align-center}

After confirming the details of the expense, click
`Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the
sales order. When clicked, a `Create invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears.

![A create invoices pop-up window that appears when the Create Invoice is clicked.](expense/create-invoices-popup.png){.align-center}

From this pop-up window, leave the `Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field on the default
`Regular invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, and click
`Create Draft Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Doing so reveals a `Customer Invoice Draft`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} showing *only* the expense in the
`Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![A customer invoice draft with the expense in the Invoice Lines tab of the form.](expense/customer-invoice-draft-with-expense.png){.align-center}

If all the information related to the expense is correct, click
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the invoice.
Doing so moves the status of the invoice from `Draft`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to `Posted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To send the invoice to the customer, click
`Send \& Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so reveals a
`Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, with a
preconfigured message and PDF invoice in the body of the message. The
message can be reviewed and modified, if needed.

Once ready, click `Send \& Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
send the invoice to the customer. When clicked, the pop-up window
disappears, and Odoo sends the message/invoice to the customer.
Additionally, a PDF of the invoice is automatically downloaded for
record-keeping and/or printing purposes.

Back on the `Customer Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click
the `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button when
the customer pays for the invoiced expense.

![A customer invoice with the register payment button ready to be clicked.](expense/customer-invoice-register-payment.png){.align-center}

When `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is clicked, a
`Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears. In this pop-up window, the necessary fields are auto-populated
with the correct information. After reviewing the information, click
`Create Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![A register payment pop-up window on a customer invoice in Odoo Sales.](expense/register-payment-popup.png){.align-center}

Once `Create Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is clicked, the
pop-up window disappears, and a green `In
Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner is in the upper-right
corner of the invoice, signifying this invoice is paid for in full.
Thus, completing the workflow.

# Invoicing policies

Depending on business needs, it may be advantageous to choose whether to
invoice customers based on the goods and services that they order or
when those goods and services are delivered to them. To allow businesses
maximum flexibility to best meet their needs, Odoo offers two invoicing
policies that can be enabled in the **Sales** app:
`Invoice what is ordered <invoice-on-order>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and
`Invoice what is delivered <invoice-on-delivery>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

## Configuring an invoicing policy

To configure an invoicing policy, go to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and under the `Invoicing`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} heading, select an `Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option: `Invoice what is ordered`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Invoice what is delivered`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Activating an invoicing policy option automatically applies the chosen
option to all newly created products. Existing products **must** have
their invoicing policy manually updated on their product forms.

![Choosing an invoicing policy in the Sales app.](invoicing_policy/invoicing-policy-setting.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If the `Invoice what is delivered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option is chosen, it is **not** possible to activate the
`Automatic Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature, which
automatically generates invoices when an online payment is confirmed.
::::

### Changing the invoicing policy for existing products

After the invoicing policy has been configured in *Settings*, navigate
to a product\'s form through
`Sales app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and choosing a product. Locate the
`Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option located
under the `General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
Use the drop-down menu to change the policy.

![How to change invoicing policy on a product form in the \*\*Sales\*\* app.](invoicing_policy/invoicing-policy-general-info-tab.png)

## Invoicing what is ordered {#invoice-on-order}

The *Invoice what is ordered* option is used as the default mode in the
**Sales** app, which means customers are invoiced once a quotation has
been sent to the customer and confirmed. The creation of a quotation in
turn leads to the creation and confirmation of a sales order. An invoice
can then be created as soon as the sales order is confirmed.

This invoicing policy has no impact on the basic Odoo sales flow.

### Invoice ordered quantity workflow

Confirm that the product\'s invoicing policy is set to
`Ordered quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the product
form.
`Create a quotation and sales order <sales/create-quotation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} as normal. After the sales order has been confirmed, create
an invoice by clicking the `Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the sales order form. Choose the type of
invoice to be sent, click `Create Draft Invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, confirm the invoice when ready, and proceed with the
payment flow as normal.

::: example
A independent artisan with a small business sells handmade jewelery
nationwide online. Because they have direct control over their inventory
levels and ship with 3rd party carriers, they invoice their customers
after a sales order has been confirmed.

The artisan receives an order for a necklace. They send their customer a
quotation, confirm it, and create a sales order. After the sales order
has been confirmed, an invoice can be created and sent to the customer
for payment without any additional steps be taken. The invoice gets
paid, the necklace is shipped and delivered, and the transaction is
complete.
:::

## Invoicing what is delivered {#invoice-on-delivery}

The *Invoice what is delivered* option invoices customers as different
amounts of the ordered goods are delivered. This option is often used
for businesses that sell large quantities of physical goods in each
sales order, but may not always be able to completely fulfill a given
order all at once. In these cases, the ordered quantity may differ
slightly from the delivered quantity based on product availability. Once
a quotation is confirmed, and the status changes from
`Quotation sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Sales order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, Odoo automatically
adds both the delivered and invoiced quantities to the invoice and sales
order. Both partial and complete deliveries are tracked. `Backorders
<inventory/shipping/backorders>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} can be
created for partial orders that will be completed at a later time.

This invoicing policy has a minor impact on the sales flow because the
delivered quantity of a product needs to be manually entered on the
sales order.

![How to see delivered and invoiced quantities on Odoo Sales.](invoicing_policy/invoicing-policy-order-lines.png)

### Invoice delivered quantity workflow

Confirm that the product\'s invoicing policy is set to
`Delivered quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the product
form.
`Create a quotation and sales order <sales/create-quotation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} as normal. After the sales order has been confirmed, the
product must be delivered before an invoice can be created.

Once the product has been shipped and delivery has been confirmed, click
the `Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button on the
sales order screen and click `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to validate the delivery order. Once at least a partial
delivery has been confirmed, return to the sales order form. The
`Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is now purple
to indicate that an invoice can be created and confirmed, and that it is
possible to proceed with the payment flow as normal.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

If a user attempts to create an invoice without validating the delivered
quantity, the system returns an error message alerting them to the
issue.

![If Delivered Quantities invoicing policy is chosen, ensure a quantity has been
delivered.](invoicing_policy/invoicing-policy-error-message.png)
::::

::: example
A produce distributor using the invoice what is delivered option sells
50 heads of lettuce to a local restaurant. At the time the delivery is
made, only 40 heads are available. The distributor delivers the
available heads of lettuce and creates an invoice for what was
delivered. Later, when more supply comes in, the distributor delivers
the remaning 10 heads of lettuce and creates a second invoice to
complete the order.

# Invoice project milestones

Invoicing based on project milestones can be used for expensive or
large-scale projects. The series of milestones in a project represent a
clear sequence of work that will inevitably result in the completion of
a project and/or contract.

This method of invoicing ensures the company gets a consistent flow of
money throughout the lifetime of the project. Customers can closely
monitor every phase of the project\'s development as it happens, in
addition to paying a large bill in several installments, instead of all
at once.

## Create milestone products

In Odoo, each milestone of a project is considered as an individual
product.

To create and/or configure products to work like this, first navigate to
`Sales app
--> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Then, click on a product, or create a new one by clicking
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The option to invoice based on milestones is only available for certain
product types.

On the product form, under the `General Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, the `Product Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field *must* be set on any of the following options:
`Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Event Ticket`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Event Booth`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Course`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The invoicing policy field drop-down menu with options on product form.](milestone/product-type-field.png){.align-center}

With any of those `Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
options selected, choose `Based on Milestones`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the `Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu.

![The invoicing policy field drop-down menu with options on product form.](milestone/invoicing-policy-field.png){.align-center}

Beneath that is the `Create on Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

To ensure workflows are as seamless as possible, it is recommended that
an option in the `Create on Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field is selected.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Leaving it on the default `Nothing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option won\'t negatively affect the desired workflow. However, a project
*must* then be created directly from a sales order form with that
specific product. Once a project is created *then* milestones and tasks
can be created and configured.
::::

When the `Create on Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} default
option of `Nothing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is clicked, a
drop-down menu is revealed with the following options:

- `Task`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Odoo creates a task related
  to this milestone product in the *Projects* app when this specific
  product is ordered.
- `Project \& Task`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Odoo creates a
  project and task related to this milestone product in the *Projects*
  app when this specific product is ordered.
- `Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Odoo creates a project
  related to this milestone product in the *Projects* app when this
  specific product is ordered.

When `Task`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, a
`Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears. In this
field, select to which existing project in the *Projects* app this
created task should be connected.

![The Project field appears when the Task option is selected in Create on Order field.](milestone/task-option-project-field.png){.align-center}

When `Project \& Task`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, two new fields
appear: `Project Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Workspace Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Project template and workspace template fields that appear on milestone product.](milestone/project-task-option-project-workspace-fields.png){.align-center}

The `Project Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field provides
template options to use for the project that will be created when this
specific product is ordered.

The `Workspace Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
provides template options to use for the workspace (for the *Documents*
app, not the *Projects* app) that will be automatically generated for
the project when this specific product is ordered.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

For organizational purposes, click the `Sales`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab on the product form, and enter a custom
\'Milestone\' related descriptor in the
`Sales Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. This
information appears in the `Description`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column on the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of the sales order.

Or, directly edit/modify the `Description`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field on the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of the sales order.

This is *not* a requirement.
::::

## Invoice milestones

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The following flow features a trio of milestone products that have
`Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set as their
`Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Task`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set on their
`Create on Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![Product with Service \"Product Type\" and \"Task\" in the Create on Order field on form.](milestone/settings-for-workflow.png){.align-center}

Those tasks are then attached to a pre-existing
`Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which, in this case, is
titled, `Rebranding Projects`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

To invoice milestones, create a sales order with the milestone
product(s). To do that, go to `Sales app --> New`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Doing so reveals a blank quotation form.

From this quotation form, add a `Customer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, click `Add a product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab. Next, add the milestone product(s) to the
`Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

Once the corresponding milestone product(s) have been added, click
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the order, which
turns the quotation into a sales order.

When the order is confirmed, new smart buttons appear at the top of the
sales order based on what was selected in the
`Create on Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the
product form.

From the sales order, click the `Milestones`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button. Doing so reveals a blank
`Milestones`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page. Click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add milestones.

![Adding milestones to a sales order with milestone products.](milestone/adding-milestones.png){.align-center}

Enter a `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the milestone.
Next, apply it to the corresponding `Sales
Order Item`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Lastly, assign a
`Deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the milestone, if
desired.

Repeat that process for all milestone sales order items.

Then, return to the sales order, via the breadcrumbs. From the sales
order, click the `Tasks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button. Doing so reveals a `Tasks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
page with a task for each sales order item with that option designated
in the `Create on Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![Sample tasks page accessed via the smart button from a sales order with milestone products.](milestone/tasks-page.png){.align-center}

To manually assign a configured milestone to a task, click the desired
task, which reveals the task form. On the task form, select the
appropriate milestone to which this task should be connected, in the
`Milestone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![The milestone field on the task form when dealing with milestone products in Odoo Sales.](milestone/milestone-field-on-task-form.png){.align-center}

Repeat this process for all milestone tasks.

With those tasks properly configured, employees log in their progress as
they work on the task, in addition to adding any notes related to the
task.

Then, when that task is complete, that means that milestone has been
reached. At that point, it is time to invoice that milestone.

To invoice a milestone, first return to the sales order --- either via
the breadcrumb links, or by navigating to
`Sales app --> Orders --> Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and picking the appropriate sales order.

Back on the sales order form, click the `Milestones`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button, and check the box in the
`Reached`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column for that particular
task.

![What it looks like to mark a milestone as reached via the milestone smart button.](milestone/reached-milestone.png){.align-center}

Next, return to the sales order --- either by clicking
`View Sales Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
`Milestones`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, or via the
breadcrumb links.

Back on the sales order, the line item for the milestone that\'s been
reached has its `Delivered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column
filled. That\'s because the milestone has been reached, and therefore
delivered.

![A milestone product that\'s been reached marked as delivered on the sales order in Odoo.](milestone/delivered-milestone-product-sales-order.png){.align-center}

Click `Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
upper-left corner. Doing so reveals a `Create
invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

![The create invoices pop-up window that appears when create invoice button is clicked.](milestone/create-invoices-pop-up.png){.align-center}

On the `Create invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, leave the `Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option on the default `Regular Invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} selection, and click the
`Create Draft Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

Upon clicking `Create Draft Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
Odoo reveals the `Customer Invoice Draft`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, *only* showing that reached milestone in the
`Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![A customer invoice draft showing only the milestone product that\'s been reached.](milestone/invoice-draft-milestone.png){.align-center}

From this invoice page, click the `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to confirm the invoice. Then, when the customer
has paid for this milestone, click `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

When `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is clicked, a
`Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears.

![The Register Payment pop-up window that appears when Register Payment is clicked.](milestone/register-payment-pop-up.png){.align-center}

On this pop-up window, confirm the accuracy of the auto-populated
fields, then click `Create Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

When clicked, the pop-up window disappears, and Odoo returns to the
invoice for that milestone, which now has a green
`In Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner in the
upper-right corner. This banner signifies the invoice has been paid.

![An invoice with a milestone product that has been paid with an In Payment banner.](milestone/in-payment-invoice.png){.align-center}

Then, return to the sales order, via the breadcrumb links. Back on the
sales order, in the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, the reached milestone that\'s been invoiced and paid for, now has
its `Invoiced`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column filled.

![The Invoiced column of a milestone product that\'s been paid for is filled.](milestone/invoiced-column-filled-milestone.png){.align-center}

There is also a new `Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button at the top of the sales order. Clicking that reveals all the
invoices that are connected to this sales order.

![The invoices smart button that appears at the top of a sales order with milestones.](milestone/invoices-smart-button.png){.align-center}

Simply repeat the above process for each milestone as it is worked on,
and subsequently, completed.

Continue that process until the entire project has been completed, each
milestone has been invoiced, and the entire order has been paid for in
full.

# Pro-forma invoices

A *pro-forma invoice* is an abridged or estimated invoice sent in
advance of a delivery of goods. It notes the kind and quantity of goods,
their value, and other important information, such as weight and
transportation charges.

Pro-forma invoices are commonly used as preliminary invoices with a
quotation. They are also used during importation for customs purposes.
They differ from a normal invoice, in that they are *not* a demand (or
request) for payment.

## Configuration

In order to utilize pro-forma invoices, the *Pro-Forma Invoice* feature
**must** be activated.

To enable this feature, navigate to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and in the
`Quotations \& Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, click
the checkbox next to `Pro-Forma
Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save all changes.

![The Pro-Forma Invoice feature setting in the Odoo Sales application.](proforma/pro-forma-setting.png){.align-center}

## Send pro-forma invoice

With the `Pro-Forma Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature
activated, the option to send a pro-forma invoice is now available on
any quotation or sales order, via the
`Send Pro-Forma Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![The Send Pro-Forma Invoice button on a typical sales order in Odoo Sales.](proforma/send-pro-forma-invoice-button.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Pro-forma invoices can **not** be sent for a sales order or quotation if
an invoice for a down payment has already been sent, or for a recurring
subscription.

In either case, the `Send Pro-Froma Invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button does **not** appear.

However, pro-forma invoices **can** be sent for services, event
registrations, courses, and/or new subscriptions. Pro-forma invoices are
not limited to physical, consumable, or storable goods.
::::

When the `Send Pro-Forma Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button is clicked, a pop-up window appears, from which an email can be
sent.

In the pop-up window, the `Recipients`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field is auto-populated with the customer from the
sales order or quotation. The `Subject`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field and the body of the email can be modified, if
necessary.

The pro-forma invoice is automatically added as an attachment to the
email.

When ready, click `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and Odoo
instantly sends the email, with the attached pro-forma invoice, to the
customer.

# Invoicing based on time and materials

Invoicing based on time and/or materials is typically used when
accurately estimating the size of a project isn\'t possible, or when the
requirements of a project may change.

This is different from a fixed-price contract, when a customer agrees to
pay a specified total for the fulfillment of the contract\-\--no matter
what needs to be paid to the employees, sub-contractors, vendors,
suppliers, and so on.

The Odoo *Sales* app can invoice for time and various other expenses
(e.g. transport, lodging), as well as purchases needed to fulfill an
order.

## App and settings configuration

First, in order to accurately keep track of the progress of a project,
the Odoo *Project* and *Accounting* apps **must** be installed.

To install the *Project* app, navigate to
`Odoo main dashboard --> Apps`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Then, on the `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, locate the
`Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app block, and click
`Activate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The page automatically
refreshes and returns to the main Odoo dashboard, where the *Project*
app is now available to access.

Repeat the same process to install the *Accounting* application.

After installation, click the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} app icon from the main Odoo dashboard, and navigate to
`Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. On
the `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, scroll down to
the `Analytics`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and ensure
the box next to `Analytic
Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is checked.

![How it looks to activate the Analytic Accounting setting in Odoo Accounting Setting page.](time_materials/analytic-accounting-setting.png){.align-center}

Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save all
changes.

Then, navigate to
`Odoo main dashboard --> Project app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. On the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, in the
`Time Management`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, ensure the
box beside the `Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature
is checked.

Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save all
changes.

![What the Timesheets feature looks like on the Odoo Project settings page.](time_materials/timesheets-feature.png){.align-center}

## Service product configuration {#sales/invoicing/configured-service-product}

With the *Timesheets* feature activated in the *Project* app, it is now
possible to invoice for time spent on a project, but **only** when the
following product configurations have been made.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Invoicing for time spent on a project is **only** possible with products
that have *Service* set as the *Product Type* on their product form.
::::

To configure a service product, first navigate to
`Sales app --> Products -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. On the
`Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, select the desired
service product to be configured, or click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to create a new product.

From the product form, in the `General Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, set the `Product Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to `Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then,
open the drop-down menu in the `Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, and select
`Based on Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Next, from the `Create on Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down menu, select `Project \& Task`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. That setting indicates that, when a sales order is
created with this specific service product, a new project and task is
created in the *Project* app.

![The correct settings for Invoicing Policy and Create on Order fields for service product.](time_materials/service-product-general-settings.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The option `Task`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be chosen
instead from the `Create on Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down menu. If `Task`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is chosen,
select an existing project that the task will appear in from
`Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, which only appears
if `Task`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is chosen in the
`Create on Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
::::

## Add time spent to sales order

After properly configuring a service product with the correct *Invoicing
Policy* and *Create on Order* options, it is possible to add time spent
to a sales order.

To see that in action, navigate to `Sales app --> New`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to open a blank quotation form. Then, proceed to
add a `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and in the
`Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select the
properly `configured service product
<sales/invoicing/configured-service-product>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} from the drop-down menu.

Next, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the
order.

After confirming the sales order, two smart buttons appear at the top of
the order form: `Projects`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Tasks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![How the Projects and Tasks smart buttons look on a Sales Order in Odoo Sales.](time_materials/projects-tasks-smart-buttons.png){.align-center}

If the `Projects`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button is
clicked, it reveals the specific project related to this sales order. If
the `Tasks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button is clicked,
it reveals the specific project task related to this sales order. Both
are also accessible in the *Project* app.

In order to add time spent on a sales order, click the
`Tasks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button.

On the task form, select the `Timesheets`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. From the `Timesheets`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, employees can be assigned to work on the project,
and the time they spend working on the task can be added by the
employees or by the person who created the sales order.

To add an employee, and the time spent working on the task, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Then, select the
appropriate `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. There is also the option
to add a brief description of the work done during this time in the
`Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, but it\'s not
required.

Lastly, enter the amount of time worked on the task in the
`Hours Spent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, and click away
to complete that line in the `Timesheets`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The time entered in the `Hours Spent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column is immediately reflected in the
`Allocated Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field (located near
the top of the task form) as a percentage, which reflects how much of
the total allocated work hours have been done so far.

That same information is found as numerical hours in the
`Hours Spent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Remaining Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields, located at
the bottom of the `Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![How the Timesheets tab appears on a task form in Odoo Sales and Odoo Project.](time_materials/timesheets-tab-on-task.png){.align-center}
::::

Repeat this process for however many employees and hours have been
worked on the project.

## Invoice time spent

Once all the necessary employees and time spent have been added to the
project task, return to the sales order to invoice the customer for
those hours. To do that, either click the `Sales
Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the top of the
task form, or return to the sales order via the breadcrumb links,
located in the upper-left of the screen.

Back on the sales order form, the time that was added to the task is
reflected in the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
(in the `Delivered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column) and in
the new `Recorded
Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the top of the
sales order.

To invoice the customer for time spent on the project, click
`Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select
`Regular invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
`Create invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.
Then, click `Create Draft Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Doing so reveals a `Customer Invoice Draft`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, clearly showing all the work that\'s been done in the
`Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Pay attention to the `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column in the `Customer
Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, as that information is
necessary to ensure other time/material invoicing tasks are completed
properly and accurately.

![Invoice draft showing time spent on sales order in Odoo Sales.](time_materials/invoice-lines-time.png){.align-center}
::::

Click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the

## Expenses configuration

In order to track and invoice expenses related to a sales order, the
Odoo *Expenses* app **must** be installed.

To install the *Expenses* app, navigate to
`Odoo main dashboard --> Apps`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Then, on the `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, locate the
`Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app block, and click
`Activate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The page automatically refreshes and returns to the main Odoo dashboard,
where the `Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app is now
available to access.

## Add expenses to sales order {#sales/invoicing/add-expenses-sales-order}

To add an expense to a sales order, first navigate to the
`Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app. Then, from the
main *Expenses* dashboard, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, which reveals a blank expense form.

On the expense form, add a `Description`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of the expense (e.g. [Hotel Stay]{.title-ref}, [Plane
Ticket]{.title-ref}). Next, in the `Category`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, select the appropriate option from the drop-down
menu (e.g. `Meals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Miles`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Travel \& Accommodation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Expense categories can be added and modified by navigating to
`Expenses app -->
Configuration --> Expense Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

Then, enter the total amount of the expense in the
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, as well as any
`Included Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that may apply.
Next, ensure that the correct `Employee`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is selected, and designate who paid for the expense in
the `Paid By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field: the
`Employee (to reimburse)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or the
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Next, in the `Customer to Reinvoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, select the appropriate sales order from the drop-down menu. Then,
select that same sales order information from the `Analytic
Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, as well.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
will **only** have the corresponding sales order as an option if the
sales order contains a service product that is billed based on
*Timesheets*, *Milestones*, or *Delivered Quantities*.
::::

![How to properly fill out an expense form that\'s attached to a sales order in Odoo.](time_materials/expense-detail-form.png){.align-center}

If there are any receipts that should be uploaded and attached to the
expense, click the `Attach Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button, and upload the necessary documents to the expense. This is
**not** required, but it may affect whether or not an expense is
approved.

When all the information has been entered, click
`Create Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create an expense
report detailing all the expense information that was just entered.

![How an Expense Report Summary looks in Odoo Expenses.](time_materials/expense-report-summary.png){.align-center}

Then, there\'s the option to `Submit to Manager`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for approval. Once approved, the
`Report in Next Payslip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears.

To showcase a complete flow in this example, select
`Submit to Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, the
manager would click `Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
approve this expense, and click `Post Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to post this expense to the accounting journal.

## Invoice expenses

To invoice a customer for an `expense on a sales order
<sales/invoicing/add-expenses-sales-order>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, navigate to the related sales order, either from the
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app or from the expense
report in the `Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app.
From the expense report, click the `Sales Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button at the top of the page.

If the expense report was linked to the sales order, the
newly-configured expense now has its own line in the
`Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and can be
invoiced to the customer.

![An expense appearing on Order Lines tab of a Sales Order in Odoo Sales application.](time_materials/invoice-expense-from-sales-order.png){.align-center}

To invoice the customer for the expense on the sales order, click
`Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select
`Regular Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
`Create invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, then
click `Create Draft Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Doing so reveals a `Customer Invoice Draft`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for the expense. Then, the invoicing process can be
completed as usual.

## Purchase configuration

In order to invoice a customer for purchases made on a sales order, the
*Purchase* application **must** be installed.

To install the *Purchase* application, navigate to
`Odoo main dashboard --> Apps`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Then, on the `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, locate the
`Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app block, and click
`Activate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The page automatically
refreshes and returns to the main Odoo dashboard, where the
`Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app is now available to
access.

## Add purchase to sales order {#sales/invoicing/add-purchase-to-sales-order}

To add a purchase to a sales order, a purchase order must first be
created. To create a purchase order, navigate to
`Purchase app --> New`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} to reveal
a blank purchase order form.

First, add a `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the purchase
order. Then, under the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, click the `extra column options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down menu, represented by two horizontal lines with dots on them,
located to the far-right of the column headers. From that drop-down
menu, select `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![How to add analytic distribution column on purchase order form in Odoo Purchase.](time_materials/extra-column-analytic-distribution-option.png){.align-center}

After adding the `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column to the headers on the
`Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the purchase order
form, proceed to add the product(s) to the purchase order. To do that,
click `Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select the
desired product from the drop-down menu. Repeat for all the products to
add.

:::: important
::: title

In order for a purchase to be properly invoiced on a sales order, the
product on the purchase order **must** be marked as
`Can be Expensed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, have an
`Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set to
`Delivered quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and have the
`At cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option selected in the
`Re-Invoice Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on its
product form.

![Product settings for a purchase order to be invoiced on a sales order in Odoo.](time_materials/product-form-settings-invoice-purchase.png){.align-center}
::::

Then, select the appropriate `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} associated with the sales order to which this purchase
order is related. To do that, click the empty
`Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
reveal an `Analytic`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

Then, from the `Departments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down menu, select the analytic distribution associated with the
desired sales order to be invoiced for the purchase.

![How to select the Analytic Distribution department from a purchase order in Odoo.](time_materials/analytic-drop-down-distribution.png){.align-center}

Once all the information is entered in the `Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of the purchase order, confirm the order by
clicking `Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, click
`Receive Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} when the products
have been received. This creates a receipt form.

:::: note

If any serial/lot numbers must be entered before validating the receipt
of products, then on the receipt form, click the
`details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon represented by four
horizontal lines located to the far-right of the product line.

This reveals a `Detailed Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, in which the necessary `Lot/Serial
Number(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} quantity can be added. When
ready, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the
data.
::::

Then, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to validate
the purchase order.

Next, return to the purchase order, via the breadcrumb links at the top
of the page, and click `Create Bill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to create a vendor bill that can be invoiced to the customer on the
attached sales order.

![Vendor bill draft for a purchase order to be invoiced to a customer in Odoo.](time_materials/vendor-bill-draft.png){.align-center}

:::: note

Make sure to enter a `Bill Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on
the `Vendor Bill Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} before
confirming. If a `Bill Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is *not*
entered, an error window appears, requesting that information to be
entered before confirmation can occur.
::::

Then, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the
vendor bill, which is then automatically added to the sales order, where
it can be invoiced directly to the customer attached to it.

## Invoice purchase

To invoice a customer for a purchase on a sales order, first
`add the purchase to the sales
order <sales/invoicing/add-purchase-to-sales-order>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, then navigate to the desired sales order in the
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app.

On the sales order that was attached to the purchase order, the
purchased product now has its own product line under the
`Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and it is ready to
be invoiced.

![Purchase order product on sales order to be invoiced to customer via Odoo Sales.](time_materials/purchase-order-on-sales-order.png){.align-center}

To invoice the customer for the purchase, simply click
`Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select
`Regular Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
`Create invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, then
click `Create Draft Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Doing so reveals a `Customer Invoice Draft`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} with the newly-added purchase order product in the
`Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![Customer invoice draft with purchase product attached to sales order in Odoo.](time_materials/draft-invoice-with-purchase-product.png){.align-center}

To complete the invoicing process, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text

# Use eWallets and gift cards

With Odoo, customers can use **eWallets** and **gift cards** for online
and in-store shopping.

To enable eWallets and gift cards for eCommerce and Point of Sale (PoS),
first enable `Discounts, Loyalty & Gift Card`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} under `Sales app --> Configuration -->
Settings --> Pricing section`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Once enabled, go to `Sales app --> Products --> Gift
cards & eWallet`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} a new eWallet or gift card
program.

## eWallets

eWallets allow customers to save credits on their online account and use
these credits as a payment method when buying items in an online store
or a brick-and-mortar store. eWallets can also be used to centralize
multiple `gift cards <ewallet_gift/gift-cards>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Before creating an eWallet program, it is necessary to create an eWallet
**top-up** product. Top-ups are pre-defined digital credit values added
to an eWallet in exchange for its equivalent in real currency. These
credits can then be used as a payment method in the eCommerce shop or
`PoS
(Point of Sale)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Top-up values can be of
different amounts.

::: example
A \$50 top-up can be bought for \$50, and adds that same amount of
credits to the eWallet.
:::

To create a top-up product, go to
`Sales app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} a
new product. On the product template, configure the options as follows:

- `Product Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter a name for
  the top-up product (for example, [\$50 Top-Up]{.title-ref})
- `Can be Sold`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enabled
- `Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Prepaid/Fixed Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Create on Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Nothing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the amount of
  the top-up

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In order to have eWallet top-ups of different amounts, create multiple
top-up products and modify the `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} accordingly.
::::

Once the top-up is created, go to
`Sales app --> Products --> Gift cards & eWallet`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} an
eWallet program. The following configuration options are available:

- `Program Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter a name for
  the eWallet program
- `Program Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `eWallet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `eWallet Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the
  eWallet top-up created earlier. Repeat the process if you created
  top-ups of different amounts.
- `Email template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the email
  template used for the email sent to the customer. To create a new
  template, click on the field, select `Search More`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, and then click `Create`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the currency to
  use for the eWallet program
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the company for
  which the program is valid and available
- `Available On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the
  applications on which the program is valid and available
- `Website`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the website on
  which the program is valid and available. Leave this field empty to
  include all websites.
- `Point of Sale`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the
  `PoS (Point of Sale)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in which the
  program is valid and available. Leave this field empty to include all
  `PoS (Point of Sale)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

![eWallet program configuration page](ewallets_giftcards/ewallet-configuration.png){.align-center}

Once the program is configured, click the
`Generate eWallet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
upper-left corner to generate eWallets. eWallets can be generated based
on `Customers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and/or
`Customer Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The quantity is
automatically adapted according to the `Customers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Customer Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
selected. Then, set the `eWallet
value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Finally, set the
`Valid Until`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} period if applicable.

Generated eWallets can be accessed through the
`eWallets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button in the
upper-right corner. From there, `Send`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Share`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the
eWallets via email or a URL link.

![eWallets send and share buttons](ewallets_giftcards/ewallet-share.png){.align-center}

Click on an eWallet to change the `Expiration Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
`Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of an eWallet *cannot* be
changed, deleted, or duplicated.

## Gift cards {#ewallet_gift/gift-cards}

Gift cards can be purchased by customers, and in turn used as a payment
method upon checkout at an eCommerce shop or
`PoS (Point of Sale)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Before creating a new gift card program, it is necessary to first create
gift cards as products. To do so, go to
`Sales app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} a
product. On the product template, configure the options as follows:

- `Product Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter a name for
  the gift card product
- `Can be Sold`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enabled
- `Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Prepaid/Fixed Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Create on Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Nothing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the amount of
  the gift card

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In order to have gift cards of different amounts, create multiple gift
card products and modify the `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} accordingly.
::::

Once the gift card product is created, go to
`Sales app --> Products --> Gift cards
& eWallet`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} to
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} a gift card program. The
following configuration options are available:

- `Program Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter a name for
  the gift card program
- `Program Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Gift Card`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Gift Card Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the
  gift card product created earlier. Repeat the process if you created
  gift card products of different amounts.
- `Email template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the
  default `Gift Card: Gift Card Information`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} template, or create a new template by clicking on the
  field, selecting `Search More`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  then clicking `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Print Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Gift Card`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the currency to
  use for the gift card program
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the company for
  which the program is valid and available
- `Available On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the
  applications on which the program is valid and available
- `Website`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the website on
  which the program is valid and available. Leave this field empty to
  include all websites.
- `Point of Sale`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the
  `PoS (Point of Sale)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in which the
  program is valid and available. Leave this field empty to include all
  `PoS (Point of Sale)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

![Gift card program configuration page](ewallets_giftcards/giftcard-configuration.png){.align-center}

Once the program is configured, click the
`Generate Gift Cards`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
upper-left corner to generate gift cards. Gift cards can be generated
either for `Anonymous
Customers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Selected Customers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Set the
`Quantity to generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
`Anonymous Customers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or select the
`Customers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and/or `Customer
Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
`Selected Customers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, set the
`Gift Card value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Finally, set the
`Valid Until`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} period if applicable.

Generated gift cards can be accessed through the
`Gift Cards`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button in the
upper-right corner. From there, `Send`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Share`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the gift
cards via email or a URL link.

# Discount and loyalty programs

The Odoo *Sales*, *eCommerce*, and *Point of Sale* applications allow
users to create discount and loyalty programs that customers can use for
online and in-store shopping. These programs offer more varied, public,
and time-sensitive pricing options than `pricelists
</applications/sales/sales/products_prices/prices/pricing>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

## Configure the settings

To begin using discount and loyalty programs, navigate to
`Sales --> Configuration
--> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Under the
`Pricing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading, activate the
`Discounts, Loyalty &
Gift Card`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting by checking the
box next to the feature. Finally, click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to save the changes.

## Configure discount and loyalty programs {#sales/products/loyalty-programs}

To create discount and loyalty programs, go to
`Sales --> Products --> Discount &
Loyalty`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

If no discount or loyalty programs have been created yet, Odoo provides
a choice of templates to help create the first program. Choose one of
the template cards, or click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
create a new program from scratch.

Or, if there are already existing programs, select an existing program
to edit it.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Templates **only** appear when no programs have been created, and they
disappear once the first program is created.
::::

Creating or editing a program opens the program form.

![Program options on the loyalty program form.](loyalty_discount/price-programs.png){.align-center}

The program form contains the following fields:

- `Program Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the name of
  the program in this field. The program name is **not** visible to the
  customer.
- `Program Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the desired
  `program type
  <sales/pricing_management/program-types>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} from the drop-down menu.
- `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the currency
  used for the program.
- `Pricelist`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If desired, select a
  pricelist from the drop-down menu to have this loyalty program applied
  to a specific pricelist (and customers attached to the pricelist).
  More than one pricelist can be selected in this field. When a single
  loyalty program is linked to several pricelists, it makes it viable
  for different customer segments to have different pricelists, but the
  *same* loyalty programs. If this field is left blank, the program
  applies to everyone, regardless of pricelist.
- `Points Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the name of
  the points used for the `Loyalty Cards`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} program (e.g. [Loyalty Points]{.title-ref}). The
  points unit name *is* visible to the customer. This field is **only**
  available when the `Program Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  is set to `Loyalty Cards`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the date on
  which the program becomes valid. Leave this field blank if the program
  should always be valid and not expire.
- `End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the date on
  which the program stops being valid. Leave this field blank if the
  program should always be valid and not expire.
- `Limit Usage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If desired, tick
  this checkbox, and enter a number of `usages`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to limit the number of times the program can be used
  during the validity period.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If working in a
  multi-company database, choose the one company for which the program
  is available. If left blank, the program is available to all companies
  in the database.
- `Available On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the apps on
  which the program is available.
- `Website`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select a website on
  which the program is available. Leave this field blank to make it
  available on all websites.
- `Point of Sale`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  point(s) of sale at which the program is available. Leave this field
  blank to make it available at all
  `PoS (Point of Sale)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

:::: note

The options available on the program form vary depending on the
`Program Type
<sales/pricing_management/program-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
selected.

### Program types {#sales/pricing_management/program-types}

The different `Program Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
available on the program form are:

- `Coupons`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Generate and share
  single-use coupon codes that grant immediate access to rewards.
- `Loyalty Cards`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: When making
  purchases, the customer accumulates points to exchange for rewards on
  current and/or future orders.
- `Promotions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Set conditional rules
  for ordering products, which, when fulfilled, grant access to rewards
  for the customer.
- `Discount Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Set codes which,
  when entered upon checkout, grant discounts to the customer.
- `Buy X Get Y`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: for every (X) item
  bought, the customer is granted 1 credit. After accumulating a
  specified amount of credits, the customer can trade them in to
  receive (Y) item.
- `Next Order Coupons`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Generate and
  share single-use coupon codes that grant access to rewards on the
  customer\'s next order.

### Conditional rules

Next, configure the `Conditional rules`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} that determine when the program applies to a
customer\'s order.

In the `Rules & Rewards`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} next to
`Conditional rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add
*conditions* to the program. This reveals a
`Create Conditional rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up

  code to be used for the `Discount Code`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} program, or use the default one generated by Odoo.
  This field is only available when the `Program Type`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} is set to `Discount Code`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- `Minimum Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  minimum number of products that must be purchased in order to access
  the reward. Set the minimum quantity to at least [1]{.title-ref} to
  ensure that the customer must make a purchase in order to access the
  reward.
- `Minimum Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  minimum amount (in currency), with `tax
  Included`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `tax Excluded`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, that must be spent
  in order to access the reward. If both a minimum quantity *and*
  minimum purchase amount are entered, then the customer\'s order must
  meet both conditions.
- `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the specific
  product(s) for which the program applies. Leave this field blank to
  apply it to all products.
- `Categories`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the category
  of products for which the program applies. Choose
  `All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to apply it to all product
  categories.

# Foreign currencies

With Odoo, pricelists can be used to manage prices in a number of
foreign currencies. Specifically, Odoo has the ability to work with 167
total currencies.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In order to use multiple currencies in Odoo *Sales*, the *Accounting*
application **must** be installed.
::::

## Settings

Once the *Accounting* app has been installed, foreign currencies can be
added to the database. Navigate to
`Accounting app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, scroll to the `Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, and locate the
`Main Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting.

![How the main currency feature appears on settings page in Odoo Accounting.](currencies/main-currency-setting-page.png){.align-center}

Odoo automatically sets the main currency as the currency of the country
the company is based in.

To change the main currency of the company, select the drop-down menu in
the `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select the
desired currency, and be sure to `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} the changes.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To ensure currency rates are updated automatically, enable the
*automatic currency rates* feature on the *Accounting* settings page
(`Accounting app --> Configuration --> Settings
--> Currencies section`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}).

![How the main currency feature appears on settings page in Odoo Accounting.](currencies/automatic-currency-rates.png){.align-center}

Click the checkbox beside the
`Automatic Currency Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature,
choose a designated bank to get the currency rates from in the
`Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field drop-down menu, and
select an `Interval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of time for the
updates to take place. Then determine when the date of the
`Next Run`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should be.

To instantly update the currency rates, click the
`🔁 (circular arrows)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, located
to the right of the `Next Run`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

When all configurations are complete, be sure to
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} all changes.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

All payment methods **must** be in the same currency as the sales
journal, or the company currency, if the company currency is not set. If
it is not the same, a `Validation
Error`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} message appears.
::::

## View, edit, and add currencies

To view, edit, and add currencies to the database, making them available
on pricelists and on the `Main Currency`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu, click the
`Currencies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} link, located beneath
the `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the
`Accounting app --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
page.

When the `Currencies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} link is
clicked, a separate `Currencies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page
is revealed.

![How the main currencies page appears in Odoo Accounting.](currencies/main-currencies-page.png){.align-center}

On this page, Odoo provides a master list of 167 global currencies. Each
row shows the corresponding `Currency`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Symbol`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, date of the
`Last Update`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Current Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (compared to the
default currency of the country in which the company is based).

To the far right, there are two columns, which can be toggled on or off:

- `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this currency is
  activated, which means it can be added to a pricelist, or used as the
  main currency of the company, if desired (via `Accounting app -->
  Configuration --> Settings --> Currencies section`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

By default, all the `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} currency
options are at the top of the list.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

It is recommended that *at least* one pricelist is created per
`Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} currency. See
`./pricing`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to learn more about pricelist
configuration.
::::

To toggle options on/off, click the toggle switch in the row for the
corresponding column. When *on* the color of the switch is green. When
*off*, the color of the switch is grey.

### Currency detail form

To edit any currency on the `Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, click the desired currency to reveal the detail
form for that specific currency, and proceed to make any necessary
changes.

![How a currency detail form looks in Odoo Accounting.](currencies/currency-detail-form.png){.align-center}

On the currency detail form, the relevant currency code appears in the
`Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Beneath that, the
name for the currency is in the `Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

Then, toggle the currency\'s availability with the
`Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} toggle: *on* is indicated
with a green switch, and *off* is indicated with a grey switch.

On the right of the currency detail form, the appropriate
`Currency Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (e.g.
[Dollars]{.title-ref}) and `Currency Subunit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} (e.g. [Cents]{.title-ref}) can be found.

Next, under the `Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, the
various conversion rates can be viewed, added, or deleted. Each row
shows the `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of that specific
rate, the `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to which it is
connected, followed by the `Unit per...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `...per Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The *\...* in each of the last two columns represents the main currency
set for the company. For example, if the main currency is set to
[USD]{.title-ref}, the columns are titled
`Unit per USD`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`USD per Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

To add a new rate, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
in the `Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and proceed to
fill in the necessary information in the aforementioned columns.

### Main currency detail form

If the selected currency is the main currency of the company, a blue
banner appears at the top of the currency detail form with the message:
`This is your company's currency.`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![How a main currency detail form looks in Odoo Accounting.](currencies/main-currency-detail-form.png){.align-center}

All the fields are the same as a typical currency detail form, but there
will **not** be a `Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab because
all other currency rates are based off the main currency of the company.

## Create new currency

If a desired currency isn\'t on the `Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to open a blank currency template form.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The same `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is located in
the upper-right corner of any currency detail form.
::::

![How a blank currency detail form looks in Odoo Accounting.](currencies/blank-currency-detail-form.png){.align-center}

On the blank currency detail form, proceed to enter the desired currency
code in the `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Beneath
that, enter the name for the currency in the `Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

Then, toggle the currency\'s availability with the
`Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} toggle switch.

On the right of the currency detail form, enter the appropriate
`Currency Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (e.g.
[Dollars]{.title-ref}) and appropriate
`Currency Subunit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (e.g.
[Cents]{.title-ref}).

Next, under the `Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, add a
new rate by clicking `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Then, proceed to confirm and adjust the `Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Unit per...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`...per Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields to ensure all
the auto-populated information is accurate.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The *\...* in each of the last two columns represents the main currency
set for the company. For example, if the main currency is set to
[USD]{.title-ref}, the columns are titled
`Unit per USD`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`USD per Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

## Currency-specific pricelists {#sales/products/currencies/currency-specific-pricelists}

It is recommended that *at least* one pricelist is created per active
currency in the database. To create (or assign) a pricelist to a
specific currency, start by navigating to `Sales
app --> Products --> Pricelists`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

From the `Pricelists`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, either
select an existing pricelist to edit, or click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to create a new pricelist.

On the pricelist detail form, for either a new or existing pricelist,
adjust the `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field as
desired.

::: seealso
`./pricing`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to learn more about pricelist
configuration.
:::

## Auto-conversion from public price

It should be noted that the public price seen on products is directly
related to the main currency the company has set, which is configured by
navigating to `Accounting app -->
Configuration --> Settings --> Currencies section --> Main Currency --> Currency drop-down menu`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

The sales price automatically updates if the pricelist is changed to a
different pricelist that has a different currency than the company\'s
main currency. The change in price is directly related to the updated
conversion rate for that currency.

## Set product prices

In order to have product prices set in place to avoid any changes in
currency rates, start by navigating to
`Sales app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

From the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, select the
desired product to modify. Or, create a new product by clicking the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

Then, on the product detail form, click the
`Extra Prices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button, located
in the upper-left corner. Doing so reveals a separate
`Price Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, specific to that
particular product.

![How to set product prices based on foreign currency pricelists in Odoo Sales.](currencies/price-rules-currencies.png){.align-center}

Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select the desired
pricelist from the drop-down menu in the `Pricelist`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column.

The `Applied On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
auto-populated with the product, so proceed to enter in the desired
figures in the `Min. Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The figure in the `Min. Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field means the `Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} being set
will **only** trigger if at least that amount of product is purchased.
::::

If necessary, configure a `Start Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
the set prices. Leaving those columns blank ensures the set price will
remain valid, regardless of the date of sale.

If working in a multi-company environment, designate to which company
this price rule should be applied in the `Company`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. Leaving that field blank ensures the price rule
applies to all companies in the database.

With those configurations complete, regardless of any changes/updates in
conversion, whenever those designated pricelists are applied to a
customer trying to purchase this specific product, these pre-determined
set prices appear.

# Discounts

The *Discounts* feature allows users to decrease or increase the price
on item lines in a sales quotation or order. This is calculated as a
percentage of the products\' sales price.

To access discounts in the **Sales** app, navigate to
`Sales app --> Configuration
--> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. In the
`Pricing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, tick the
`Discounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox, then click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

After the setting has been activated, navigate to the desired quotation
by going to `Sales app --> Orders --> Quotations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} at the top of the page. Once there, click on the
desired quote from the list.

## Discounts on product lines

In the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
quotation form, a new column heading appears labeled
`Disc.%`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This column is used to set
discounts on individual line items. Enter the desired discount for each
product line and the new price is automatically calculated in the
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the bottom of the page.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

A discount can also be added directly to a sales order in the same way.
Navigate to `Sales app --> Orders --> Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click the desired sales order, and add the
discount to `Disc.%`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field as
described above.
::::

![The Dis.% heading will now appear in Order Lines.](discounts/discount-on-sales-order.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Positive values for `Disc.%`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} will
apply a *discount*, while negative values can be used to *increase* the
price.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Positive values, or price decreases, will be visible to the customer,
while negative values, or price increases, will *not* be visible to the
customer. Instead of a discount column, the negative discount will
change the product\'s unit price.
::::

## Discount button {#sales/discounts/discount-button}

With the *Discounts* settings enabled, a `Discount`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button appears at the bottom of sales orders.

![The discount button located at the bottom of a sales order form in the Odoo Sales app.](discounts/discount-button-sales-order.png)

Clicking the `Discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on a
sales order opens a pop-up window, where the
`Discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} percentage, and options
are configured:

- `On All Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Add the
  specified discount percentage (configured in the
  `Discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field of the pop-up
  window) on all existing order lines of the sales order.

- `Global Discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Add a discount
  product line to the order, which has the cumulative value equivalent
  to the specified discount percentage.

  ::: example
  A global discount of 10% is added in the last line of a sales order
  with a subtotal of \$4,200 by adding a discount line with a -\$420
  value (which is 10% of \$4,200).

  ![The sales order with the applied global discount option in the Odoo Sales application.](discounts/global-discount-option.png)
  :::

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  Any product added (or removed) *after* the global discount line is
  added does **not** affect the discount value on the discount line. To
  include new products or amend current products in the global discount,
  delete the current global discount line and repeat the steps.
  ::::

- `Fixed Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Add a monetary
  amount to the `Discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
  Once applied, this amount is added to the order as a product line,
  with the monetary value subtracted from the order total.

  ::: example
  A fixed discount of \$20 appears as a product line, with a negative
  `Unit Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  ![The sales order with the applied fixed discount option in the Odoo Sales application.](discounts/fixed-discount-on-sales-order.png)
  :::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It is more beneficial to add a `Fixed Amount`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} discount after **all** desired products have been added
to a sales order. If there are changes made to the sales order *after*
the discount is added, adjust the value on the
`Discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line, or remove the line
and add the discount again, as needed.

# Pricelists

A *pricelist* is a method of dynamic pricing that applies a list of
prices (or price rules) to adjust sales prices. This adjustment can
apply to specific customers, customer groups, sales orders, time
periods, etc., and is useful for creating pricing strategies and
optimizing sales margins.

Odoo **Sales** has a useful pricelist feature that can be tailored to
fit any unique pricing strategy. Pricelists suggest certain prices, but
they can always be overridden on the sales order.

## Configuration {#sales/products/pricelist-configuration}

To enable pricelists in the Odoo **Sales** app, first navigate to
`Sales app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. In
the `Pricing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, tick the
checkbox next to the `Pricelists`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
feature, and click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save all
changes.

![How the pricelist feature setting looks in Odoo Sales.](pricing/pricelist-feature-setting.png)

After activating and saving the `Pricelists`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} feature, the `Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page reloads. From here, either select the
`oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Pricelists`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} link (beneath the
`Pricelists`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature on the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page), or navigate to
`Sales app --> Products --> Pricelists`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Either option reveals the `Pricelists`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, in which pricelists can be created and/or
modified at any time.

![How the pricelists page looks in Odoo Sales.](pricing/18-sales-pricelist-page.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If there is no specific pricelist configured on a sales quotation, the
`Default`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pricelist is applied. The
`Default`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pricelist is the first
pricelist found in
`Sales app --> Products --> Pricelists`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} without an assigned `Country
Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Odoo will read the
`Pricelist Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column from top to
bottom to determine the `Default`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pricelist.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Selectable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column is only
applicable to Odoo **eCommerce**. This option allows website visitors to
choose a pricelist when shopping in your **eCommerce** website.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In Odoo 17 (and above), you are *not required* to enter a pricelist in
the `Pricelist`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on a sales
quotation form in order to confirm it (i.e. turn it into a sales order).

The chatter section is available on pricelist forms, which allows you to
add notes and communications on each pricelist page.
::::

### Creating and editing pricelists

From the `Pricelists`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, either
select the pricelist to edit, or click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to create a new pricelist, which reveals a blank
pricelist form that can be configured in a number of different ways.

![How the pricelist detail form looks in Odoo Sales.](pricing/18-sales-new-pricelist-form.png)

When creating a new pricelist, start by adding a name for the pricelist
at the blank field at top of the form. Next, select which
`Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should be used.

If working in a multi-company environment, select which company this
pricelist should apply to in the `Company`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. If this field is left blank, the pricelist is
automatically applied to all companies in the database.

If working in a multinational company, select the countries where this
pricelist will apply under the `Country Groups`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column.

### Price Rules tab {#sales/products/price-rules}

In the `Price Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, each line
creates a new record that will implement customized pricing to the sales
order where the pricelist is applied. To create a new price rule, click
on `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which opens a new
pricelist rules form.

Then, select whether to apply this set of rules to a
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

From here, there are several configuration options:

- `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If selected in the
  `Apply To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, use this field to
  choose one or more products to which this pricelist will apply.
- `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select one or more
  product categories to which this pricelist will apply.
- `Price Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select whether the
  specialized pricing will fall under `Discount`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Formula`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Fixed Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Depending on the
  price type, there will be additional configurations on how to apply
  the pricelist.
  - `Discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the percentage
    to be discounted. A mark-up can be configured by using a negative
    value in this field.

    :::: important
    ::: title
    Important
    :::

    If a pricelist is applied to a sales quotation with the discount
    `Price Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set as
    `Discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the discount will
    visible to the customer.

    ![A pricelist rule using Price Type: Discount to create a discount.](pricing/sales-pricelist-pricerule-discount.png)

    ![How a pricelist rule using Price Type: Discount appears on customer preview.](pricing/sales-pricelist-pricerule-discount-customer.png)
    ::::

  - `Formula`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Calculate the
    pricelist rules based the following configuration:

    - `Discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Percentage discount
      to be applied. Negative values can be entered to increase prices.

    :::: important

    If a pricelist is applied to a sales quotation with the discount
    `Price Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set as
    `Formula`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the discount will
    *not* be visible to the customer.
    ::::

    - `Round off to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Numerical value
      to act as round-off multiple, to be applied after discount. The
      rounding method sets the price so that it is a multiple of the
      value in this field.

      :::: note

        role="guilabel"} and `Round off to`{.interpreted-text
        role="guilabel"} have been applied.
      - `Fixed Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter fixed
        price for this pricelist. When applied, all product lines in the
        quotation form will be updated to this price.
      ::::
- `Min Qty`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Specify the minimum
  quantity of selected products for this pricelist to apply.
- `Validity Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Specify the
  start and end date during which this pricelist can be applied to
  quotations.

::: example
To formulate a 100% markup (or two times the price of the product), with
a \$5 minimum margin, set the `Based price`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field to `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and the `Discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to [-100]{.title-ref}. This is often seen in retail situations.

::::

### Recurring Prices tab

Time-based rules are used specifically with subscription products. Be
sure to check out the Odoo
`Subscriptions </applications/sales/subscriptions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation for more information.

In the `Recurring Prices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
pricelists are configured with the same options as in the
`Price Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, with additional
columns for `Product Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Recurring Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

`Product Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are configured
under products that have one or more values, such as color, size, etc.
Once a product has been selected under the
`Products Tab`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, if applicable, select
the desired product variants to be included in the price rule.

Then, select the blank field in the `Recurring Plan`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column to reveal a drop-down menu of pre-designated
recurrence periods (e.g. [Monthly]{.title-ref}, [Quarterly]{.title-ref},
[Weekly]{.title-ref}, etc.).

![The recurring prices tab in a pricelist configuration form.](pricing/sales-pricelist-recurringprices.png)

New recurrence periods can also be created from this column. To do so,
type in the name for the new `Recurring Plan`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, then select `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the resulting drop-down menu to create the time
period, which can be edited later. Alternatively, select `Create and
edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to reveal a
`Create Recurring Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up form.
From this pop-up form, the new recurrence period can be configured, with
specific `Details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Self-Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Pricing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options. When the
configurations are complete, click the `Save &
Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![Custom time period pop-up form in Odoo Sales.](pricing/time-period-popup.png){.align-center}

Lastly, add the desired price for this recurring price rule in the
`Recurring Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

::: seealso
`../../../subscriptions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}

### Rental rules tab

Price rules can be configured for
`rental products <../../../rental>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} under
the `Rental rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, using the
same methodology as the `Price Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Recurring Prices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tabs.

To add a rental rule, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and select a desired product in the
`Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. Then, select any
specific `Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, if necessary.

Next, designate a `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of time
for the rental rule (e.g. [Daily]{.title-ref}, [Hourly]{.title-ref},
etc.).

Lastly, configure a `Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
rental rule in the respective column.

## Customer pricelist application {#sales/products/customer-pricelist-application}

While the default pricelist applied to any customer is the
`Public Pricelist`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, Odoo provides the
opportunity to directly apply a different pricelist to customers on
their contact form.

To do that, open the desired customer\'s contact form, either by
navigating to `Sales
app --> Orders --> Customers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
and selecting the customer from the main `Customers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, or by clicking on the customer\'s name on a sales
order.

![Sample customer detail form in Odoo Sales.](pricing/customer-detail-form.png){.align-center}

On the desired customer\'s contact form, under the
`Sales & Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, in the
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, designate what
pricelist should be applied to this specific customer from the drop-down
menu in the `Pricelist`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![The pricelist field in a customer detail form in Odoo Sales.](pricing/customer-form-pricelist-field.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When a customer is added to the database, the default pricelist is
automatically applied to them. There is **no way** to have a blank
*Pricelist* field on a contact form. Even if that field is left blank,
the default pricelist appears when that contact form is opened again.

However, when that contact is added to a quotation, and the *Pricelist*
field is auto-populated (based on the information from their contact
form), that predetermined pricelist can be removed from the *Pricelist*
field, and the quotation can still be confirmed, and subsequently,
turned into a sales order.
::::

### Conditions

At the bottom of the `Create Pricelist Rules`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up form is the `Conditions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section.

Here, start by selecting one of the options in the
`Apply On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field:

- `All Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the advanced
  pricelist rule will be applied to all products.
- `Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the advanced
  pricelist rule will be applied to a specific category of products.
- `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the advanced pricelist
  rule will be applied to a specific product.
- `Product Variant`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the advanced
  pricelist rule will be applied to a specific product variant.

If any of those options, apart from `All Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, are selected, a new option-specific field appears, in
which the specific `Product Category`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Product Variant`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be chosen.

Then, select a minimum quantity to be applied to the advanced pricelist
rule in the `Min.
Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Lastly, select a
range of dates for the pricelist item validation in the
`Validity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Once all configurations are complete, either click
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the advanced
pricelist rule, or click `Save & New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to immediately create another advanced pricelist rule on a fresh form.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If a price rule is set for a particular product, and another one for its
product category, Odoo takes the rule of the product itself.

# Import products

Odoo *Sales* provides a template for importing products with categories
and variants, which can be opened and edited with any spreadsheet
software (Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice, Google Sheets, etc.).

When this spreadsheet is filled out properly, it can be quickly uploaded
to the Odoo database. When uploaded, those products are instantly added,
accessible, and editable in the product catalog.

## Import template

In order to import products with categories and variants, the *Import
Template for Products* **must** be downloaded. Once downloaded, the
template can be adjusted and customized, and then uploaded back into the
Odoo database.

To download the necessary import template, navigate to
`Sales app --> Products -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. On the
`Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, click the
`⚙️ (gear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the upper-left
corner. Doing so reveals a drop-down menu.

From this drop-down menu, select the `Import records`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option.

![The Import records option selectable from the gear icon on the Products page in Odoo Sales.](import/gear-import-records-option.png){.align-center}

Selecting `Import records`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} reveals a
separate page with a link to download the
`Import Template for Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click
that link to download the template.

![The Import records option selectable from the gear icon on the Products page in Odoo Sales.](import/import-template-products.png){.align-center}

Once the template download is complete, open the spreadsheet file to
customize it.

## Customize product import template

When the import template has been downloaded and opened, it\'s time to
modify its contents. However, before any changes are made, there are a
few elements to keep in mind during the process:

- Feel free to remove any columns that aren\'t deemed necessary. But, it
  is *strongly* advised that the `Internal Reference`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} column remains.

  While it\'s not mandatory, having a unique identifier (e.g.
  [FURN_001]{.title-ref}) in the `Internal
  Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column for each product
  can be helpful in many cases. This can even be from previous software
  spreadsheets to ease the transition into Odoo.

  For example, when updating imported products, the same file can be
  imported several times without creating duplicates, thus enhancing the
  efficiency and simplicity of imported product management.

- Do **not** change the labels of columns that are meant to be imported.
  Otherwise, Odoo won\'t recognize them, forcing the user to map them on
  the import screen manually.

- Feel free to add new columns to the template spreadsheet, if desired.
  However, to be added, those fields **must** exist in Odoo. If Odoo
  can\'t match the column name with a field, it can be matched manually
  during the import process.

  During the import process of the completed template, Odoo reveals a
  page showcasing all the elements of the newly-configured product
  template spreadsheet, separated by `File
  Column`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Odoo Field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Comments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  To manually match a column name with a field in Odoo, click the
  `Odoo Field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu next to
  the `File Column`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that needs a
  manual adjustment, and select the appropriate field from that
  drop-down menu.

  ![The Odoo Field drop-down menu next to a Field Column that needs to be manually adjusted.](import/odoo-field-dropdown-menu.png){.align-center}

## Import product template spreadsheet

After customizing the product template spreadsheet, return to the Odoo
product import page, where the template download link is found, and
click the `Upload File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
upper-left corner.

![The upload file button on the import products template download page in Odoo Sales.](import/upload-file-button.png){.align-center}

Then, a pop-up window appears, in which the completed product template
spreadsheet file should be selected and uploaded to Odoo.

After that, Odoo reveals a page showcasing all the elements of the
newly-configured product template spreadsheet, separated by
`File Column`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Odoo Field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Comments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The import a file page in Odoo Sales after a product template has been uploaded.](import/import-a-file-page.png){.align-center}

From here, the `File Column`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be
manually assigned to an `Odoo Field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
if necessary.

To make sure everything is appropriate, and all the columns and fields
are lined up accurately, click the `Test`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the upper-left corner.

If everything is lined up and applied correctly, Odoo reveals a blue
banner at the top of the page, informing the user that
`Everything seems valid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The everything seems valid message that appears if file columns are entered correctly.](import/everything-seems-valid-message.png){.align-center}

If there are any errors, Odoo reveals a red banner at the top of the
page, with instructions of where to locate the specific issues, and how
to fix them.

![The import error message that appears if file columns don\'t match an Odoo Field.](import/import-error-message.png){.align-center}

Once those errors are fixed, click `Test`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} again to ensure all necessary issues have been remedied
appropriately.

If additional product template spreadsheets need to be uploaded, click
the `Load File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, select the
desired product template spreadsheet, and repeat the process.

When everything is ready, click the `Import`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

When clicked, Odoo instantly imports those products, and reveals the
main `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, with a pop-up
message in the upper-right corner. This pop-up message informs the user
how many products were successfully imported.

![The pop-up window that appears after a successful product import process in Odoo Sales.](import/successful-import-popup.png){.align-center}

At this point, all the newly-imported products are accessible and
editable via the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.

## Import relation fields, attributes, and variants

It\'s important to note that an Odoo object is always related to many
other objects. For example, a product is linked to product categories,
attributes, vendors, and things of this nature. These links/connections
are known as relations.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In order to import product relations, the records of the related object
**must** be imported *first* from their own list menu.
::::

### Relation fields

On product forms in Odoo, there are a number of fields that can be
modified and customized at any time. These fields are found under every
tab on a product form. While these fields are easily editable directly
on the product form, they can also be modified via a product import.

As mentioned, relation fields of this nature can **only** be imported
for products if they already exist in the database. For example, if a
user attempts to import a product with a *Product Type*, it can only be
one of the preconfigured product types existing in the database (e.g.
*Storable Product*, *Consumable*, etc.).

To import information for a relation field on a product import template
spreadsheet, add the name of the field as a column name/title on the
spreadsheet. Then, on the appropriate product line, add the desired
relation field option.

When all desired relation field information has been entered, save the
spreadsheet, and import it to the database, per the process mentioned
above (`Sales app --> Products -->
Products --> ⚙️ (gear) icon --> Import records --> Upload File`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}).

Once the spreadsheet with the newly-configured relation field
information has been uploaded, click `Import`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and Odoo returns to the `Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page.

When the newly-changed/modified products, complete with the new relation
field information, has been imported and uploaded, that new information
can be found on the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.

### Attributes and values

Odoo also allows users to import product attributes and values that can
be used for products that already exist in the database, and/or with
imported products.

To import attributes and values, a separate spreadsheet or CSV file
dedicated to attributes and values **must** be imported and uploaded
before they can be used for other products.

The column names/titles of the attributes and values spreadsheet should
be as follows: `Attribute`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Display Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Variant Creation Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Values / Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![An attributes and values spreadsheet template for imports.](import/attributes-and-values-spreadsheet.png){.align-center}

- `Attribute`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: name of the attribute
  (e.g. [Size]{.title-ref}).
- `Display Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: display type used
  in the product configurator. There are three display type options:
  - `Radio`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: values displayed as
    radio buttons
  - `Selection`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: values displayed in
    a selection list
  - `Color`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: values denoted as a
    color selection
- `Variant Creation Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: how the
  variants are created when applied to a product. There are three
  variant creation mode options:
  - `Instantly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: all possible
    variants are created as soon as the attribute, and its values, are
    added to a product

  - `Dynamically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: each variant is
    created **only** when its corresponding attributes and values are
    added to a sales order

  - `Never`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: variants are **never**
    created for the attribute

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    The `Variants Creation Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    **cannot** be changed once the attribute is used on at least one
    product.
    ::::
- `Values/Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: values pertaining
  to the corresponding attribute. If there are multiple values for the
  same attribute, the values need to be in individual lines on the
  spreadsheet.

Once the desired attributes and values have been entered and saved in
the spreadsheet, it\'s time to import and upload it into Odoo. To do
that, navigate to `Sales app --> Configuration
--> Attributes --> ⚙️ (gear) icon --> Import records --> Upload File`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Once the spreadsheet with the newly-configured attributes and values has
been uploaded, click `Import`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
Odoo returns to the `Attributes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
page. That\'s where those newly-added attributes and values can be found
and edited, if necessary.

As mentioned previously, when attributes and values have been added to
the Odoo database, they can be used for existing or imported products.

### Product variants

When product attributes and values are configured in the database, they
can be used on product import spreadsheets to add more information and
detail to products being imported.

To import products with product attributes and values, the product
import template spreadsheet must be configured with specific
`Product Attributes / Attribute`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Product
Attributes / Values`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns.

There can be other columns, as well, but these columns are **required**
in order to properly import products with specific variants.

![Product variants spreadsheet with product attributes and variants for import purposes.](import/product-attribute-spreadsheet-import.png){.align-center}

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: product name
- `Product Attributes / Attribute`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  name of attribute
- `Product Attributes / Values`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  values pertaining to the corresponding attribute

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To import multiple values, separate them by *just* a comma, **not** a
comma followed by a space, in the product import template spreadsheet
(e.g. [furniture,couch,home]{.title-ref}).
::::

When the desired products and product variants have been entered and
saved in the spreadsheet, it\'s time to import and upload them into
Odoo. To do that, navigate to `Sales app -->
Products --> Products --> ⚙️ (gear) icon --> Import records --> Upload File`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Once the spreadsheet with the newly-configured products and product
variants has been uploaded, click `Import`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and Odoo returns to the `Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page. That\'s where the newly-added products can be
found.

To view and modify the attributes and variants on any products, select
the desired product from the `Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, and click the
`Attributes \& Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

# Product images with Google Images

Having appropriate product images in Odoo is useful for a number of
reasons. However, if a lot of products need images, assigning them can
become incredibly time-consuming.

Fortunately, by configuring the *Google Custom Search* API within an
Odoo database, finding product images for products (based on their
barcode) is extremely efficient.

## Configuration {#product_images/configuration}

In order to utilize *Google Custom Search* within an Odoo database, both
the database and the Google API must be properly configured.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Free Google accounts allow users to select up to 100 free images per
day. If a higher amount is needed, a billing upgrade is required.
::::

### Google API dashboard {#product_images/google-api-dashboard}

## Product images in Odoo with Google Custom Search API {#product_images/get-product-images}

Adding images to products in Odoo can be done on any product or product
variant. This process can be completed in any Odoo application that
provides access to product pages (e.g. *Sales* app, *Inventory* app,
etc.).

Below is a step-by-step guide detailing how to utilize the *Google
Custom Search API* to assign images to products in Odoo using the Odoo
*Sales* application:

1.  Navigate to the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page
    in the *Sales* app (`Sales app -->
    Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}). Or,
    navigate to the `Product Variants`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} page in the *Sales* app
    (`Sales app --> Products --> Product Variants`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}).

2.  Select the desired product that needs an image.

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    Only products (or product variants) that have a barcode, but **not**

    it will continue where it stopped the day before.

# Product variants

Product variants are used to give single products a variety of different
characteristics and options for customers to choose from, such as size,
style, or color, just to name a few.

Products variants can be managed via their individual product template,
or by navigating to either the `Product Variants`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Attributes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
page. All of these options are located within the Odoo *Sales*
application.

::: example
An apparel company has the following variant breakdown for one their
best-selling t-shirts:

- Unisex Classic Tee
  - Color: Blue, Red, White, Black
  - Size: S, M, L, XL, XXL

Here, the **T-shirt** is the product template, and **T-shirt: Blue, S**
is a specific product variant.

**Color** and **Size** are *attributes*, and the corresponding options
(like **Blue** and **S**) are *values*.

In this instance, there is a total of twenty different product variants:
four **Color** options multiplied by five **Size** options. Each variant
has its own inventory count, sales totals, and other similar records in
Odoo.

## Configuration

To use product variants, the *Variants* setting **must** be activated in
the Odoo *Sales* application.

To do that, go to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and locate the
`Product Catalog`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section at the top
of the page.

In that section, check the box to enable the
`Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature.

![Activating product variants on the Settings page of the Odoo Sales application.](variants/activating-variants-setting.png){.align-center}

Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.

## Attributes

Before product variants can be set up, attributes **must** be created.
To create, manage, and modify attributes, navigate to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Attributes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The order of attributes on the `Attributes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page dictates how they appear on the *Product
Configurator*, *Point of Sale* dashboard, and *eCommerce* pages.
::::

To create a new attribute from the `Attributes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Doing so reveals a blank attributes form that can be customized and
configured in a number of ways.

![A blank attribute creation form in the Odoo Sales application.](variants/attribute-creation.png){.align-center}

First, create an `Attribute Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
such as [Color]{.title-ref} or [Size]{.title-ref}.

Next, select one of the options from the
`Display Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. The `Display
Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} determines how this product is
shown on the online store, *Point of Sale* dashboard, and *Product
Configurator*.

The `Display Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options are:

- `Pills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: options appear as
  selectable buttons on the product page of the online store.
- `Color`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: options appear as small,
  colored squares, which reflect any HTML color codes
- `Radio`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: options appear in a
  bullet-style list on the product page of the online store.
- `Select`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: options appear in a
  drop-down menu on the product page of the online store. set, on the
  product page of the online store.
- `Multi-checkbox (option)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: options
  appear as selectable checkboxes on the product page of the online
  store.

![Display Types on Product Configurator on the online store in Odoo.](variants/display-types.png){.align-center}

The `Variant Creation Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
informs Odoo when to automatically create a new variant once an
attribute is added to a product.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Variant Creation Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
**must** be set to `Never (option)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
in order for the `Multi-checkbox (option)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to work properly as the `Display
Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

- `Instantly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: creates all possible
  variants as soon as attributes and values are added to a product
  template.
- `Dynamically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: creates variants
  **only** when corresponding attributes and values are added to a sales
  order.
- `Never (option)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: never
  automatically creates variants.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Once added to a product, an attribute\'s
`Variants Creation Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} cannot be
edited.
::::

The `eCommerce Filter Visibility`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field determines whether or not these attribute options are visible to
the customer on the front-end, as they shop on the online store.

- `Visible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the attribute values are
  visible to customers on the front-end.
- `Hidden`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the attribute values are
  hidden from customers on the front-end.

Lastly, in the optional `eCommerce Category`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, select a category from a drop-down menu to group
similar attributes under the same section for added specificity and
organization.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To view the details related to the attribute category selected, click
the internal link `fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(right arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the far-right
of the `eCommerce Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
once an option has been selected. Doing so reveals that attribute
category\'s detail form.

![A standard attribute category detail page accessible via its internal link arrow icon.](variants/attribute-category-internal-link.png){.align-center}

Here, the `Category Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is displayed at the top.
Followed by `Related Attributes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
associated with the category. These attributes can be
dragged-and-dropped into a desirable order of priority.

Attributes can be directly added to the category, as well, by clicking
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To create an attribute category directly from this field, start typing
the name of the new category, then select either
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
drop-down menu that appears.

Clicking `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} creates the
category, which can be modified later. Clicking
`Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} creates the
category and reveals a `Create Category`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window, in which the new attribute category can
be configured and customized.
::::

### Attribute values

Attribute values should be added to the
`Attribute Values`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Values can be
added to an attribute at any time, if needed.

To add a value, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
the `Attribute Values`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

Then, enter the name of the value in the `Value`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column. Next, check the box in the
`Is custom value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, if the
value is custom (i.e. the customer gets to provide unique specifications
that are specific to this particular value).

#### Colors

Next to `Display Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select the
`Color`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. Go to the
`Attribute Values`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to modify the
value settings.

![Add an image of the pattern to an attribute.](variants/attribute-value-add-image.png)

To choose a color, click the blank circle in the
`Color`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, which reveals an HTML
color selector pop-up window.

![Selecting a color from the HTML color pop-up window that appears on attribute form.](variants/picking-a-color.png)

In this pop-up window, select a specific color by dragging the color
slider to a particular hue, and clicking on the color portion directly
on the color gradient window.

Or, choose a specific color by clicking the *dropper* icon, and
selecting a desired color that\'s currently clickable on the screen.

If you sell products with specific patterns, you can also add an image
to display the pattern of the product. To do so, click the
`fa-camera`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(camera)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon, then click the `fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(pencil)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and
select an image from your local drive. This pattern will appear as a
color option on the ecommerce product page.

![Pattern as color option on the ecommerce page.](variants/ecommerce-pattern-option.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Attributes can also be created directly from the product template by
adding a new line and typing the name into the
`Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
::::

Once an attribute is added to a product, that product is listed and
accessible, via the attribute\'s `Related Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button. That button lists every product in the
database currently using that attribute.

## Product variants

Once an attribute is created, use the attribute (and its values) to
create a product variant. To do that, go to
`Sales app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select an existing product to view that
desired product\'s form. Or, click `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to create a new product, to which a product variant can
be added.

On the product form, click the
`Attributes \& Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to view,
manage, and modify attributes and values for the product.

![The attributes and values tab on a typical product form in Odoo Sales.](variants/attributes-values-tab.png){.align-center}

To add an attribute to a product, and subsequent attribute values, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Attributes \& Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Then,
choose the desired attribute from the drop-down menu that appears.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Attributes can be created directly from the
`Attributes \& Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of a
product form. To do that, start typing the name of the new attribute in
the blank field, and select either `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the mini drop-down menu that appears.

Clicking `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} creates the
attribute, which can be customized later. Clicking
`Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} creates the
attribute, and a `Create Attribute`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up form appears. In the pop-up form, proceed to modify the attribute
in a number of ways.
::::

Once an attribute is selected in the `Attribute`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column, proceed to select the specific attribute values
to apply to the product, via the drop-down menu available in the
`Values`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

There is no limit to how many values can be added.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Similar product variant creation processes are accessible through the
Purchase, Inventory, and eCommerce applications.
::::

### Configure variants {#products/variants/configure-variants}

To the far-right of the attribute line is a
`Configure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. When clicked,
Odoo reveals a separate page showcasing those specific
`Product Variant Values`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Product Variant Values page accessible via the Configure button on a product form.](variants/product-variant-values.png){.align-center}

Here, the specific `Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} name,
`HTML Color Index`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (if applicable),
and `Value Price Extra`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are viewable.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Value Price Extra`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} represents
the increase in the sales price if the attribute is selected.
::::

When a value is clicked on the
`Product Variant Values`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, Odoo
reveals a separate page, detailing that value\'s related details.

![A Product Variant Values page accessible via the Product Variants Values general page.](variants/product-variant-value-page.png){.align-center}

On the specific product variant detail page, the
`Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Value Price Extra`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields can be
found, along with an `Exclude for`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

In the `Exclude for`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, different
`Product Templates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and specific
`Attribute Values`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be added. When
added, this specific attribute value will be excluded from those
specific products.

### Variants smart button

When a product has attributes and variants configured in its
`Attributes \& Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, a
`Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button appears at
the top of the product form. The `Variants`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button indicates how many variants are currently
configured for that specific product.

![The variants smart button at the top of the product form in Odoo Sales.](variants/variants-smart-button.png){.align-center}

When the `Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button is
clicked, Odoo reveals a separate page showcasing all the specific
product variant combinations configured for that specific product.

![The variants page accessible via the variants smart button on the product form in Odoo.](variants/variants-page.png){.align-center}

## Impact of variants

In addition to offering more detailed product options to customers,
product variants have their own impacts that can be taken advantage of
throughout the Odoo database.

- `Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: barcodes are associated
  with each variant, instead of the product template. Each individual
  variant can have its own unique barcode/SKU.

- `Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: every product variant has
  its own public price, which is the sum of the product template price
  *and* any extra charges for particular attributes.

  ::: example
  A red shirt\'s sales price is \$23 \-- because the shirt\'s template
  price is \$20, plus an additional \$3 for the red color variant.
  Pricelist rules can be configured to apply to the product template, or
  to the variant.
  :::

- `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: inventory is counted
  for each individual product variant. On the product template form, the
  inventory reflects the sum of all variants, but the actual inventory
  is computed by individual variants.

- `Picture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: each product variant can
  have its own specific picture.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Changes to the product template automatically apply to every variant of
that product.

# Returns and refunds

The Odoo *Sales* app provides two different ways to process returns. The
method used depends on whether or not an invoice has been sent.

## Before invoicing

Returns are completed using *Reverse Transfers* when a customer decides
to return a product **before** an invoice has been sent or validated.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In order to use *Reverse Transfers*, the *Inventory* app **must** be
installed.
::::

To start a return before invoicing, navigate to the
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, select the desired
sales order, and click on the `Delivery`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button to open the associated delivery order.

![A typical sales order with a highlighted delivery smart button in Odoo Sales.](returns/sales-order-delivery-smart-button.png){.align-center}

On the validated delivery order, click `Return`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![A validated delivery order with a highlighted Return button in Odoo Sales.](returns/validated-delivery-order-return-button.png){.align-center}

This opens a `Reverse Transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window.

By default, the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} matches
the validated quantities from the delivery order. Update the quantities,
if necessary. Click on the `🗑️ (trash)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon next to a line item to remove it from the return.

![The \"Reverse Transfer\" pop-up window, to make a return before invoicing the customer.](returns/reverse-transfer-popup.png){.align-center}

Next, click `Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the
return. This generates a new warehouse operation for the incoming
returned product(s).

![Warehouse operation after a return has been confirmed in Odoo Sales.](returns/warehouse-operation-confirmed-return.png){.align-center}

Upon receiving the return, the warehouse team validates the warehouse
operation by clicking `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Then, on the original sales order, the `Delivered`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} quantity updates to reflect the difference between the
initial validated quantities and the returned quantities.

![The updated \"Delivered\" quantity on the sales order after the reverse transfer.](returns/updated-sales-quantities.png){.align-center}

When an invoice is created, the customer receives an invoice **only**
for the products they are keeping, if any.

## After invoicing

Sometimes, customers return an item after they receive and/or pay for
their invoice. In these cases, a return using only *Reverse Transfers*
is insufficient since validated, or sent, invoices cannot be changed.

However, *Reverse Transfers* can be used in conjunction with *Credit
Notes* to complete the customer\'s return.

To start a return after invoicing, navigate to the relevant sales order
in the `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app.

If there is a payment registered on the sales order, the payment details
appear in the chatter, and the invoice (accessible through the
`Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button) has a green
`In
Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner.

![Sample of a green in payment banner in Odoo Sales.](returns/green-in-payment-banner.png){.align-center}

From the sales order, click on the `Delivery`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button to view the validated delivery order.
Then, click `Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open the
`Reverse Transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

Next, edit the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and/or
`Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, as needed for the return.
Then, click `Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This generates
a new warehouse operation for the incoming returned product(s), which is
validated by the warehouse team once the return is received by clicking
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then, on the sales order, the `Delivered`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} quantity updates to reflect the difference between the
initial validated quantities and the returned quantities.

To process a refund, navigate to the relevant invoice (from the sales
order, click on the `Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button). Then, click the `Credit Note`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button at the top of the validated invoice.

![A typical customer invoice with a Credit Note button highlighted in Odoo Sales.](returns/credit-note-button.png){.align-center}

Doing so reveals a `Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up form.

![Typical credit note pop-up form that appears in Odoo Sales.](returns/credit-note-pop-up-form.png){.align-center}

Start by entering a `Reason displayed on Credit Note`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and a specific `Journal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to process the credit. Then, select a specific
`Reversal Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

After the information is filled in, click `Reverse`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Reverse and Create
Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, edit the draft, if
needed.

Lastly, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm
the credit note.

When complete, a blue banner reading:
`You have outstanding credits for this customer. You
can allocate them to mark this invoice as paid.`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} appears at the top of the page.

# Create quotations

In Odoo **Sales**, quotations can be created and sent to customers. Once
a quotation has been confirmed, it officially turns into a *sales
order*, which can then be invoiced and paid for.

## Quotation settings {#sales/quotation-settings}

To access these setting options, navigate to
`Sales app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and scroll to the
`Quotations & Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

![The Quotations and Orders section on the Odoo Sales app Settings page.](create_quotations/quotations-orders-section.png){.align-center}

- `Quotation Templates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enable this
  option to create quotation templates featuring standard product
  offers, which are then selectable on quotation forms. When this
  checkbox is ticked, an additional field,
  `Default Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, appears, along
  with a link to the `Quotation Templates`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} page.
- `Online Signature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Request an
  online signature to confirm orders.
- `Online Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Request an online
  prepayment from customers to confirm orders. Request a full or partial
  payment (via down payment). When this checkbox is ticked, an
  additional field, `Prepayment amount (%)`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, appears. There is also a link to the `Payment
  Providers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.
- `Default Quotation Validity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  Determine a set amount (in `days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"})
  that quotations can remain valid for.
- `Default Recurrence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select a
  default period from the drop-down menu to use as a recurrence period
  for a new quotation.
- `Sale Warnings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Get warning
  messages about orders that include specific products or customers.
- `PDF Quote builder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Customize the
  look of quotations with header pages, product descriptions, footer
  pages, and more.
- `Lock Confirmed Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Ensure no
  further edits can be made to confirmed orders.
- `Pro-Forma Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Send pro-forma
  invoices to customers.

To activate any of these settings, tick the checkbox beside the desired
option(s). Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Quotations dashboard

The *Quotations* dashboard is the page that appears when the
`Sales app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} is opened.

By default, the `Quotations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
dashboard displays all quotations in the database related to the current
user, as indicated by the default `My Quotations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} filter present in the search bar.

![The Quotations dashboard present in the Odoo Sales application.](create_quotations/quotations-dashboard.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To view *all* quotations in the database, remove the
`My Quotations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter from the
search bar.
::::

Quotations on this page appear in a default list view, but can also be
viewed in a `oi-view-kanban`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Kanban`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view,
`fa-calendar`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Calendar`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Pivot`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} table, `fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Graph`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`fa-clock-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Activity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} view.

To view and/or modify any listed quotation from the
`Quotations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, click on the
desired quotation line from the list, and Odoo reveals the specific form
for that selected quotation.

## Create quotation {#sales/create-quotation}

To create a quotation, open the `Sales app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, located in the upper-left corner of the main
`Quotations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is **only** present
if the `Quotations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard is in
list or Kanban view.
::::

Clicking the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button reveals a
blank quotation form, with various fields and tabs to configure.

![A typical quotation form in the Odoo Sales application.](create_quotations/quotation-form.png){.align-center}

Begin by entering the customer\'s name in the
`Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field at the top of the
form. This is a **required** field.

If the customer\'s information is already in the database, the
`Invoice Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Delivery Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields
auto-populate with the saved information for those respective fields,
based on the data from that customer\'s contact record (found in the
**Contacts** application).

If the customer was referred by another customer or contact, enter their
name in the `Referrer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

If a `Referrer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, a new
field, `Commission Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears, in
which a commission can be selected from the drop-down menu. This
commission is rewarded to the contact selected in the
`Referrer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Next, if they have not already been auto-populated with the customer\'s
information, enter the appropriate addresses in the
`Invoice Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Delivery Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields. Both of
these fields are **required**.

Then, if desired, choose a `Quotation Template`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down field to apply to this quotation. It
should be noted that some additional fields may appear, depending on the
template selected.

The default date that appears in the `Expiration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field is based on the number configured in the
`Default Quotation Validity setting <sales/quotation-settings>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (in
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}).

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

When using a quotation template, the date in the
`Expiration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is based off the
`Quotation Validity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} figure on the
template form.
::::

If the quotation is for a recurring product or subscription, select the
desired `Recurring
Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from that specific drop-down
menu.

If desired, select a specific `Pricelist`{.interpreted-text

Lastly, select any specific `Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to be used for this quotation.

### Order Lines tab

The first tab on the quotation form is the
`Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

In this tab, select products, and quantities of those products, to add
them to the quotation.

There are two ways to add products to the quotation from this tab.

Click `Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select the
desired item from the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down field, and proceed to adjust the quantity of that selected
product, if necessary.

Or, click `Catalog`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to reveal a
separate page, showcasing every item (and every potential product
variant) in an organized catalog display, with items organizable by
`Product
Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Attributes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![A product catalog accessible via a quotation in the Odoo Sales application.](create_quotations/product-catalog.png){.align-center}

From here, simply locate the desired items, click the
`fa-shopping-cart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the product card, and
adjust the quantity, if needed. When complete, click the
`Back to Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
upper-left corner to return to the quotation, where the newly-selected
catalog items can be found in the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.

If multiple items should be presented in a more organized way on the
quotation, click `Add
a section`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, enter a name for the
section, and drag-and-drop that section heading in the desired location
amongst the items in the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. The section heading appears in bold.

If needed, click `Add a note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} beneath
a certain product line to add a custom note about that specific product.
The note appears in italics. Then, if needed, proceed to drag-and-drop
the note beneath the desired product line.

Beneath the product lines, there are buttons that can be clicked to
apply any of the following: `Coupon Code`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Promotions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and/or `Add
shipping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::

### Optional Products tab

Open the `Optional Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to
select related products that can be presented to the customer, which may
result in an increased sale.

For example, if the customer wants to buy a car, an optional product
that could be offered is a *Trailer Hitch*.

# Quotation deadlines

In the Odoo *Sales* application, it is possible to set deadlines on
sales quotations. Doing so encourages customers to act quickly during
sales negotiations, for they might fear for missing out on a good deal.
As well, deadlines also can also act as protection for a company in case
an order has to be fulfilled at a price that is no longer profitable for
the business.

## Quotation expiration

In Odoo *Sales*, there\'s the option to add an expiration date to a
quotation.

To add an expiration date to a quotation, navigate to
`Sales app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select a
desired quotation, or create a new one by clicking
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

On the quotation form, click the `Expiration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field to reveal a pop-up calendar. From this pop-up
calendar, select the desired month and date as the expiration date for
the quotation.

![The expiration field on a standard quotation form in Odoo Sales.](deadline/quotation-deadlines-expiration-field.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

By clicking the `Preview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on a
quotation, Odoo clearly displays when that specific offer expires.

![How customers will see deadlines on Odoo Sales.](deadline/quotation-deadlines-preview.png){.align-center}
::::

## Quotation template expiration

The Odoo *Sales* application also makes it possible to add a deadline
expiration date to quotation templates.

To add a deadline expiration date to a quotation template, navigate to
`Sales app -->
Configuration --> Quotation Templates`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and either select the desired quotation template
to which a deadline should be added, or click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to build a new quotation template from scratch.

On the quotation template form, add a specific number of days to the
`Quotation expires
after`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, located beneath the
quotation template name. The number of days represents how long the
quotation will be valid for, before it expires.

![The quotation expires after field on a quotation template form in Odoo Sales.](deadline/quotation-deadlines-expires-after.png){.align-center}

Then, whenever that specific quotation template is used in a quote, an
expiration date is automatically calculated, based on the number of days
designated above. However, this date can be overwritten before sending
the quotation to the customer.

# Deliveries and invoices to different addresses

People and businesses often use separate addresses for billing
(invoicing) and shipping (delivery) purposes. With the Odoo **Sales**
app, contacts can have different specified addresses for delivery and
invoicing.

## Settings

To properly utilize multiple addresses in Odoo, go to the
`Accounting app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
scroll down to the `Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text

Contact forms can be accessed in the **Contacts** application, as well.
::::

From the contact form, click the `Add`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, which is located under the
`Contacts & Addresses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. This
brings up the `Create Contact`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
form, in which additional addresses can be configured.

![Add a contact/address to the contact form.](different_addresses/contact-form-add-address.png)

On the `Create Contact`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up form,
select any of the following options:

- `Contact`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Adds another contact,
  such as an employee at a company, to the contact form.
- `Invoice Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Adds a default
  invoice address to the contact form.
- `Delivery Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Adds a default
  delivery address to the contact form.
- `Follow-up Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Adds a default
  contact address that is used for follow-up communications about
  billing and other issues to the contact form.
- `Other Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Adds an alternate
  address to the contact form.

![Create a new contact/address on a contact form.](different_addresses/create-contact-window.png)

Once the corresponding information has been entered, click
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the address
and close the `Create Contact`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
window. To save the address and input additional contact information,
click `Save & New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} instead.

## Quotations and autopopulated addresses

When a customer with invoice and delivery addresses in their contact
form is added to a quotation, the `Invoice Address`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Delivery Address`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} fields autopopulate with the corresponding addresses.

![Invoice and Delivery Addresses autopopulate on a quotation.](different_addresses/quotation-address-autopopulate.png)

The `Invoice Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Delivery Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can also be edited
directly from the quotation by mousing over the address and clicking the
`oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Internal Link)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon.

# Online signatures for order confirmations

The Odoo **Sales** application provides customers with the ability to
confirm orders, via an online signature, directly on the sales order.
Once the sales order is electronically signed by the customer, the
salesperson attached to the sales order is instantly notified that the
order is confirmed.

## Activate online signatures

In order to have customers confirm orders with an online signature, the
*Online Signature* feature **must** be activated.

To activate the *Online Signature* feature, go to
`Sales app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, scroll to the
`Quotations \& Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading, and
activate the `Online Signature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
feature by checking the box beside it.

![The Online Signature feature option in the Settings of the Odoo Sales application.](get_signature_to_validate/signature-setting.png)

Then, click the `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
top-left corner.

:::: note
::: title
Note

When making a quotation template, the online signature feature is the
`Signature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, located in the
`Online confirmation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field of the
quotation template form.

![The Online confirmation signature option found on every quotation template in Odoo.](get_signature_to_validate/signature-feature-quotation-template.png)

On standard quotations, the online signature feature is the
`Signature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, located under the
`Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the quotation
form.

## Order confirmations with online signatures

When clients access quotations online through their customer portal,
there\'s a `Sign \&
Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button directly on the
quotation.

![The Sign and Pay button present on online quotations in Odoo Sales.](get_signature_to_validate/sign-and-pay-button.png)

When clicked, a `Validate Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window appears. In this pop-up window, the
`Full Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is auto-populated,
based on the contact information in the database.

![The Validate Order pop-up window for online signatures in Odoo Sales.](get_signature_to_validate/validate-order-popup.png)

Then, customers have the option to enter an online signature with any of
the following options: `Auto`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Draw`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or `Load`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

`Auto`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} lets Odoo automatically
generate an online signature based on the information in the
`Full Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
`Draw`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} lets the customer use the
cursor to create a custom signature directly on the pop-up window. And
`Load`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} lets the customer upload a
previously-created signature file from their computer.

After the customer has chosen any of the three previously mentioned
signature options (`Auto`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Draw`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or `Load`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}), they will click the `Accept \&
Sign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

When `Accept \& Sign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is clicked, the
various payment method options become available for them to choose from
(if the *online payment* option applies to this quotation).

Then, when the quotation is paid and confirmed, a delivery order is
automatically created (if the Odoo **Inventory** app is installed).

### View online signatures in Developer Mode

Clients can view the online signature in
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

To view a online signature from a paid invoice, go to
`Sales app --> Orders -->
Orders`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select the desired
sales order. A new tab, `Customer Signature`{.interpreted-text

signature as well as the `Signed By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Signed On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} information.

# Margins

The sales margin is the profit gained from the sale of a product or
service after all the costs related to it have been accounted for.

In the Odoo **Sales** application, it is possible to show sales margins
on quotations and sales orders. Salespeople can use the feature for
better management and monitoring of profitability.

## Configuration

To activate the *Margins* feature, go to the
`Sales app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. In the
`Pricing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, tick the
`Margins`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox. Then click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Margins checkbox.](margin/margins-checkbox.png)

### Configure price and cost {#sales_quotations/margin/configure-price-and-cost}

To automatically calculate the sales margin for each quotation or sales
order line item, go to
`Sales app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Fill out the `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields in
the `General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab for
every product.

Odoo calculates the margin by:

$$Sales~Margin = Sales~Price - Cost$$

The margin percentage is calculated by:

$$\frac{Sales~Price - Cost~Price}{Sales~Price} \times 100$$

![Cable Management box product page.](margin/product-view.png)

## Compute margins on sales orders

Go to `Sales app --> Orders --> Quotations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to begin a new quotation. Fill out the quotation
with the necessary information. While adding products to the quotation,
a new field, `Margin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, automatically
appears at the bottom of the document. This field displays the order\'s
total margin in the configured currency as well as the percentage.

![Sales order with Margin field on the bottom.](margin/so-with-margin-field.png)

To display a product\'s margin and the margin percentage per line item,
click the `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(settings adjust)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
`Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

Then, tick the checkboxes for `Margin`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Margin(%)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
`Margin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column shows the profit to
earn from the sale after accounting for all associated costs. It
displays in the configured currency value. The
`Margin(%)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} shows the margin value as
a percentage. The margin for one unit is multiplied by the quantity to
determine the margin for the entire line.

The `Margin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Margin(%)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns are not displayed
by default, but once enabled, the columns appear on all new and existing
quotations and `SOs (sales orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

![Sales order with Margin and Margin(%) columns displayed.](margin/so-with-margins-checkboxes.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note

The `Margin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Margin (%)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns are not editable
since they are automatic calculations. To change the calculation, refer

## Margin calculation with a pricelist

To calculate the margin with an applied pricelist, begin with
configuring a pricelist for the product. Follow these steps:

1.  Go to `Sales app --> Products --> Pricelists`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and click the `New`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} button.
2.  Enter the name of the pricelist and click
    `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a new
    pricelist rule.
3.  Configure the pricelist and click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} button.
4.  Go to `Sales app --> Orders --> Quotations`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and create a quotation.
5.  In the `Pricelist`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select
    the newly made pricelist.
6.  Click on `Update Prices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
    refresh the product price and margin.

::: example
To apply a seasonal 5% discount on blue denim jeans that requires a
minumim of two pairs of jeans in an order and is valid only from October
to the end of December, the pricelist rule should look like this:

![Pricelist Rules pop-up window.](margin/pricelist-configuration.png)

After saving the pricelist, go to the desired
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and select the newly
created pricelist, and adjust the quantity according to the pricelist\'s
rule.

![Sales order with a new pricelist selected.](margin/so-with-pricelist.png)

After the changes are made, click `fa-refresh`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Update Prices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
update the `Margin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Margin (%)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The margin is recalculated
based on the pricelist-adjusted product\'s sales price and cost.

![Sales order with margins recalculated based on the price-list adjustment.](margin/so-with-applied-pricelist.png)

Another way to visualize the impact of margins on sales orders is to go
to `Sales
app --> Orders --> Quotations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
select the `fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(area chart)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon or
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, click
`Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and change it to
`Margin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to see margin contributions
across the customer base.

# Optional products

The use of optional products is a marketing strategy that involves the
cross-selling of products along with a core product. The aim is to offer
useful and related products to customers, which may result in an
increased sale.

For instance, if a customer wants to buy a car, they have the choice to
order massaging seats, as well, or ignore the offer and simply buy the
car. Presenting the choice to purchase optional products enhances the
customer experience.

## Optional products on quotations

With the Odoo *Sales* application, it is possible to add or modify
optional products directly on quotations by navigating to the
`Optional Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on a
quotation form.

![How to add optional products to your quotations on Odoo Sales.](optional_products/optional-products-tab.png){.align-center}

To add an optional product(s) to a quotation, click
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Optional Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of a
quotation. Doing so reveals a blank field in the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

When clicked, a drop-down menu with products from the database appear.
Select the desired product from the drop-down menu to add it as an
optional product to the quotation template.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If the desired product isn\'t readily visible, type the name of the
desired product in the field, and the option appears in the drop-down
menu. Then, select that desired product to add it to the quotation.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When a product is added, the default `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is [1]{.title-ref}, but that can be edited at any time.
::::

To delete any line item from the `Optional Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, click the `🗑️ (trash
can)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon.

Click the `Preview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, located
in the upper-left corner of the quotation, to reveal a preview of the
quotation customers would receive, via email, along with the optional
products they can potentially add to their order, located in the
`Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

![Preview your quotations on Odoo Sales.](optional_products/optional-products-checkout.png){.align-center}

Customers are able to add different optional products to an order by
clicking the `🛒
(shopping cart)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, located to the
right of the optional product line.

If a customer selects optional products, these are automatically added
to the quotation managed by the salesperson.

When the customer adds an optional product(s) to an order, the
salesperson is instantly notified about the change, along with any other
change the customer makes to an order. This allows salespeople to stay
up-to-date with everything related to an order in the backend of the
*Sales* application.

## Optional products on quotation templates

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Be sure to review the `quote_template`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation to better understand how quotation templates work before
reading the following information.
::::

For quotation templates, just like a typical quotation form, there is
also an `Optional
Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, wherein related
products or services can be added to a quotation template.

To add optional products to a quotation template, navigate to
`Sales app -->
Configuration --> Quotation Templates`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, either select an existing quotation
template to edit, or create a new one by clicking
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

On the quotation template form, click the
`Optional Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Under the
`Optional Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select the desired
product to add as an optional product to the quotation template.

![Preview your quotations on Odoo Sales.](optional_products/optional-products-tab-quotation-template.png){.align-center}

The products added in the `Optional Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab are present in the quotation, by default, whenever
that particular quotation template is used. These products can be
removed, and additional products can be added, before the quotation is
sent to a customer.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

It\'s best to offer optional products that would encourage a customer to
add additional items to their order, or entice them to purchase a more
expensive version of their initially selected product.

For example, if a customer purchases a wooden chair, some optional
products could be: a warranty on that chair and/or a wooden chair with
leather seats.

There is no limit to how many optional products can be added to a
quotation template.

# Product variants on quotations and sales orders

Before getting into detail about how to use product variants on
quotations and sales orders, it\'s recommended to learn about
`../products_prices/products/variants`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} in
Odoo.

Once familiarized with the basics surrounding product variants, the
following covers how product variants can be added to quotations and
sales orders using the *product configurator* or *order grid entry*.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It should be noted that the setting is titled, *Variant Grid Entry* on
the *Sales* app settings page, and titled, *Order Grid Entry* on product
forms. So, be sure to keep that in mind.
::::

## Settings

When working with product variants, Odoo uses the product configurator,
by default. To add the variant grid entry option, that feature **must**
be enabled in the Odoo *Sales* application. The variant grid entry
option provides a pop-up window on the quotation/sales order to simplify
the variant selection process.

To enable that setting, go to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and scroll to the
`Product Catalog`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Then,
check the box next to the `Variant Grid
Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, and click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The variant grid entry setting in the Odoo Sales application.](orders_and_variants/order-grid-entry-setting.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Of course, the `Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature
**must** also be activated, in order to use product variants on
quotations and sales orders.
::::

## Product configuration

Once the `Variant Grid Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting
is enabled, both options (*Product Configurator* and *Order Grid Entry*)
become available on every product form.

To configure a product form to use either a product configurator or
variant grid entry, start by navigating to
`Sales app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to view all the products in the database.

Then, select the desired product to configure, or click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, to create a new product from
scratch. Once on the product form, click into the
`Attributes \& Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, where
product variants can be viewed, modified, and added.

At the bottom of the `Attributes \& Variants`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, there is a `Sales Variant
Selection`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section with two options:
`Product Configurator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Order Grid
Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It should be noted that these options **only** appear if at least two
values of an attribute have been added to the record.
::::

![Sales variant selection options on the attributes and variants tab on product form.](orders_and_variants/attributes-variants-tab-selection-options.png){.align-center}

These options determine which method is used when adding product
variants to quotations or sales orders.

The `Product Configurator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} provides a
pop-up window that neatly displays all the available product variants
for that particular product when it\'s added to a quotation. However,
only one variant can be selected/added at a time.

The `Order Grid Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} provides the
same information as the `Product
Configurator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in a table layout,
allowing the user to select larger numbers of unique product variants,
and add them to a quotation/sales order, in a single view.

## Product configurator

The product configurator feature appears as a
`Configure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window, as soon as
a product with (at least two) variants is added to a quotation or sales
order, but **only** if the `Product Configurator`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option is selected on its product form.

![The product configurator pop-up window that appears on a quotation or sales order.](orders_and_variants/product-configurator-window.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This `Configure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window also
appears if the `Order Grid Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
setting is **not** activated, as it is the default option Odoo uses when
dealing with product variants on quotations and/or sales orders.
::::

The `Product Configurator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option
lets salespeople choose exactly which product variant to add to the
quotation or sales order using a format similar to online shopping.

## Order grid entry

The order grid entry feature appears as a
`Choose Product Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, as soon as a product with (at least two) variants is added to a
quotation or sales order, but **only** if the
`Order Grid Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is selected
on its product form.

![The choose product variants pop-up window that appears on a quotation in Odoo.](orders_and_variants/choose-product-variants-popup.png){.align-center}

The `Choose Product Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window features all the variant options for that particular product.
From this pop-up window, the salesperson can designate how many of each
variant they\'d like to add to the quotation/sales order at once.

When all the desired quantities and variants have been selected, the
salesperson simply clicks `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and those orders are instantly added to the quotation/sales order in the
`Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![Populated order lines tab after order grid entry has been chosen to select products.](orders_and_variants/order-grid-entry-order-lines-tab.png){.align-center}

# PDF quote builder

The *PDF Quote Builder* in Odoo *Sales* provides the opportunity to send
customers a fully customized PDF file for quotes, showcasing the company
and products, with various information and design elements, instead of
just showing the price and total.

The PDF Quote Builder groups header pages, product descriptions, the
price(s), and footer pages to create a detailed quote. It can also
inject dynamic texts or custom notes in the PDF to personalize the offer
for the customer.

Having a customized PDF in quotes provides a heightened conclusion to
the shopping experience for customers, and adds an elegant level of
professionalism to a company.

::: seealso
[Odoo Quick Tips - Create a PDF quote
\[video\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQNydBZt-VI)
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It is recommended to edit PDF forms with Adobe software. The form fields
on the header and footer PDF templates are necessary to get dynamic
values with Odoo.
::::

## Configuration

In order to add custom PDF files for quotes, the
`PDF Quote builder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature *must* be
configured.

To do that, navigate to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, on the `Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, scroll to the
`Quotations & Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and
locate the `PDF Quote builder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
feature.

## Add PDF as Header/Footer

In Odoo *Sales*, it\'s possible to add a custom PDF that can be used
either as a header or a footer. When the PDF quote builder is activated
in a quotation, you can then select as many headers and footers as you
wish to use, these PDF will then also be inserted in the final PDF.

To add a custom PDF as header or footer, start by navigating to
`Sales app -->
Configuration --> Headers/Footers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. From this page, either click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Upload`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Clicking `Upload`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} instantly provides
the opportunity to upload the desired document. Then, the document can
be further configured on the document card, or by clicking the
`fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(vertical ellipsis)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the top
right corner of the document card, and then clicking
`Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} reveals a blank
documents form, in which the desired PDF can be uploaded via the
`Upload your file`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
form, located in the `File Content`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

Various information and configurations related to the uploaded document
can be modified here.

The first field on the documents form is for the
`Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the document, and it is
grayed-out (not clickable) until a document is uploaded. Once a PDF has
been uploaded, the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
auto-populated with the name of the PDF, and it can then be edited.

Then, in the `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
click the drop-down menu, and select either: `Header`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Footer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
define whether these files would be selectable to be at the beginning or
at the end of your quote.

Under this, in the `Quotation Templates`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, this PDF can be restricted quotation templates
only.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Alternatively, you can also navigate to `Sales app --> Configuration -->
Quotation Templates`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select a
template and directly `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Upload`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} a PDF to it in the
`Quote Builder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
::::

Lastly, beside the `File Content`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, you have the possibility to
`Configure dynamic fields`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Dynamic text in PDFs

While creating custom PDFs for quotes, use *dynamic text* for Odoo to
auto-fill the PDF content with information related to the quote from the
Odoo database, like names, prices, etc.

Dynamic text values are form components (text inputs) that can be added
in a PDF file, and Odoo automatically fills those values in with
information related to the quote.

### Dynamic text values

Below are common dynamic text values used in custom PDFs that are
already mapped to the correct fields, and what they represent.

For headers and footers PDF:

- `name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Sales Order Reference
- `partner_id__name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Customer Name
- `user_id__name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Salesperson Name
- `amount_untaxed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Untaxed Amount
- `amount_total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Total Amount
- `delivery_date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Delivery Date
- `validity_date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Expiration Date
- `client_order_ref`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Customer
  Reference

For product PDF:

- `description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Product Description
- `quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Quantity
- `uom`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Unit of Measure (UoM)
- `price_unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Price Unit
- `discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Discount
- `product_sale_price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Product List
  Price
- `taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Taxes name joined by a
  comma ([,]{.title-ref})
- `tax_excl_price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tax Excluded
  Price
- `tax_incl_price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tax Included
  Price

After uploading a PDF, you can then
`Configure dynamic fields`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This will
allow you to map any field name found in your PDF to the field you want
to show by writing down any existing path. Headers and footers starts
from the current `sale_order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} model,
whereas product document follows their path from their
`sale_order_line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Leaving that path
empty allows you to fill a custom notes, directly from the specific
quote that requires it.

::: example
When a PDF is built, it\'s best practice to use common dynamic text
values (`name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`partner_id_name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}). When uploaded
into the database, Odoo auto-populates those fields with the information
from their respective fields.

In this case, Odoo would auto-populate the Sales Order Reference in the
`name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dynamic text field, and the
Customer Name in the `partner_id_name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

![PDF quote being built using common dynamic placeholders.](pdf_quote_builder/pdf-quote-builder-sample.png){.align-center}
:::

Once the PDF file(s) are complete, save them to the computer\'s hard
drive, and proceed to upload them to Odoo via
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Headers/Footers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

::: example
When uploading PDF containing the form field
`invoice_partner_country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which is
an information available in the sales order, configure the
`path`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the
`Form Field Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to: -
`partner_invoice_id.country_id.name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
for a header or footer document -
`order_id.partner_invoice_id.country_id.name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for a product document fills the form with the invoice
partner country\'s name when the PDF is built.
:::

::: example
When uploading any PDF containing the form field
`custom_note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, leaving the
`path`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} empty allows the seller to
write down any note where that form field is in that document and shown
when the PDF is built.
:::

## Add PDF to product

In Odoo *Sales*, it\'s also possible to add a custom PDF to a product
form. When a PDF is added to a product, and that product is used in a
quotation, that PDF is also inserted in the final PDF.

To add a custom PDF to a product, start by navigating to
`Sales app --> Products
--> Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select the
desired product to add a custom PDF to.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

A document could also be added to a product variant, instead of a
product. If there are documents on a product *and* on its variant,
**only** the documents in the variant are shown.

To add a custom document to a product variant, navigate to
`Sales app -->
Products --> Product Variants`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Select the desired variant, click the `Documents`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button, and proceed to upload the custom document
to the specific product variant.
::::

On the product page, click the `Documents`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button at the top of the page to navigate to a
`Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page for that product,
where files related to that product can be uploaded. From this page,
either click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Upload`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Documents smart button on a product form in Odoo Sales.](pdf_quote_builder/documents-smart-button.png)

Clicking `Upload`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} opens the
computer\'s local file directory. An uploaded document can be further
configured on the document card, or by clicking the
`fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(vertical ellipsis)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
top-right corner of the document card, and then clicking
`Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} reveals a blank
documents form, in which the desired PDF can be uploaded via the
`Upload your file`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
form, located in the `File Content`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

### PDF form configuration

![A standard document form with various fields for a specific product in Odoo Sales.](pdf_quote_builder/blank-document-form.png)

The first field on the documents form is for the
`Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the document, and it is
grayed-out (not clickable) until a document is uploaded. Once a PDF has
been uploaded, the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
auto-populated with the name of the PDF, and it can then be edited.

Prior to uploading a document, there\'s the option to designate whether
the document is a `File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
`Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field menu.

![A standard document form with an uploaded pdf in Odoo Sales.](pdf_quote_builder/document-form-uploaded-pdf.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If a PDF is uploaded, the `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field is auto-populated to `File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and it cannot be modified.
::::

Then, in the `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, in the
`Visible at`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, click the
drop-down menu, and select either: `On quotation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `On confirmed order`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Inside quote pdf`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

- `Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the document is sent
  to (and accessible by) customers at any time.
- `Confirmed order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the document is
  sent to customers upon the confirmation of an order. This is best for
  user manuals and other supplemental documents.
- `Inside quote`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the document is
  included in the PDF of the quotation, between the header pages and the
  `Pricing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the quote.

::: example
When the `Inside quote`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option for
the `Visible at`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is chosen, and
the custom PDF file, [Corner Desk.pdf]{.title-ref} is uploaded, the PDF
is visible on the quotation in the *customer portal* under the
`Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![Sample of an uploaded pdf with the on quote option chosen in Odoo Sales.](pdf_quote_builder/pdf-on-quote-sample.png)
:::

Beside the `File Content`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, you
have the possibility to `Configure dynamic fields`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. When doing so, remember that the starting model is the
`sale_order_line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, unlike for headers
and footers that start from the `sale_order`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Lastly, in the `E-Commerce`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
decide whether or not to `Publish on Website`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} so that the PDF appears on the product page in the
online store.

::: example
When the `Publish on Website`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option
is enabled, a link to the uploaded document, [Corner
Desk.pdf]{.title-ref}, appears on the product\'s page in the online
store.

It appears beneath a `Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
heading, with a link showcasing the name of the uploaded document.

> ![Showing a link to an uploaded document on a product page using Odoo Sales.](pdf_quote_builder/show-product-page.png)
:::

## PDF quote

On a sales order, in the `Quote Builder`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, select additional documents to be merged into the
final PDF. If a selected document has custom fields, they appear as
editable text boxes to be filled in.

![Selectable quotation headers and footers under the Quote Builder section in a quotation.](pdf_quote_builder/quote-builder-headers.png)

Once a quote with a pre-configured PDF has been confirmed, Odoo provides
the option to print the confirmed quote to check for errors, or to keep
for records.

To print the PDF quote, navigate to the confirmed quote, and click the
`⚙️ (gear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to reveal a
drop-down menu. From this drop-down menu, select
`Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then select
`PDF Quote`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Print pdf quote option on drop-down menu located on confirmed sales order in Odoo Sales.](pdf_quote_builder/drop-down-print-pdf.png)

Doing so instantly downloads the PDF quote. When opened, the PDF quote,
along with the configured product PDF that was set to be visible inside
the quote, can be viewed and printed.

# Quotation templates

Reusable quotation templates can be made in Odoo\'s **Sales** app for
common products or services.

By using these templates, quotations can be tailored and sent to
customers at a quicker pace, without having to create new quotations
from scratch every time a sales negotiation occurs.

## Configuration

To use quotation templates, begin by activating the setting in
`Sales app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
scroll to the `Quotations &_Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
heading.

Under the heading, tick the `Quotation Templates`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox. Doing so reveals a new
`Default Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, in which a
default quotation template can be chosen from the drop-down menu.

![How to enable quotation templates on Odoo Sales.](quote_template/quotations-templates-setting.png)

Upon activating the `Quotation Template`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} feature, an internal `fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Quotation Templates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
link appears beneath the `Default Template`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

Clicking this link reveals the `Quotation Templates`{.interpreted-text

do not forget to click the `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button to save all changes made during the session.

## Create quotation templates {#sales/send_quotations/create_templates}

To create a quotation template, click the
`Quotation Templates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} link on the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page once
`Quotation templates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are enabled, or
navigate to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Quotation Templates`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Both options reveal the
`Quotation Templates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, where
quotation templates can be created, viewed, and edited.

![Quotation templates page in the Odoo Sales application.](quote_template/quotation-templates-page.png)

To create a new quotation template, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, located in the upper-left corner. Doing so
reveals a blank quotation template form that can be customized.

![Create a new quotation template on Odoo Sales.](quote_template/blank-quotation-form.png)

Start by entering a name for the template in the
`Quotation Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Then, in the `Quotation Validity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, designate how many days the quotation template will remain valid
for, or leave the field on the default [0]{.title-ref} to keep the
template valid indefinitely.

Next, in the `Confirmation Mail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, click the blank drop-down menu to select a preconfigured email
template to be sent to customers upon confirmation of an order.

:::: tip

To create a new email template directly from the
`Confirmation Mail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, start
typing the name of the new email template in the field, and select
either: `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
drop-down menu that appears.

Selecting `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} creates the email
template, which can be edited later.

Selecting `Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
creates the email template, and a `Create
Confirmation Mail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears, in which the email template can be customized and configured
immediately.

![Create confirmation mail pop-up window from the quotation template form in Odoo Sales.](quote_template/create-confirmation-mail-popup.png)

When all modifications are complete, click
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the email
template and return to the quotation form.
::::

If working in a multi-company environment, use the
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to designate to which
company this quotation template applies.

If a journal is set in the `Invoicing Journal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, all sales orders with this template will invoice
in that specified journal. If no journal is set in this field, the sales
journal with the lowest sequence is used.

If the `Online Signature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and/or
`Online Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} features are
activated in the `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
(`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}), those options are available on quotation
template forms.

Check the box beside `Online Signature`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to request an online signature from the customer to
confirm an order.

Check the box beside `Online Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to request an online payment from the customer to confirm an order. When
`Online Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is checked, a new
percentage field appears, in which a specific percentage of payment can
be entered.

Both options, `Online Signature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Online Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be enabled
simultaneously, in which case the customer must provide **both** a
signature **and** a payment to confirm an order.

### Lines tab

In the `Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, products can be
added to the quotation template by clicking
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, organized by
clicking `Add a section`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (and
dragging/dropping section headers), and further explained with
discretionary information (such as warranty details, terms, etc.) by
clicking `Add a note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To add a product to a quotation template, click
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of a quotation template
form. Doing so reveals a blank field in the `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column.

When clicked, a drop-down menu with existing products in the database
appears. Select the desired product from the drop-down menu to add it to
the quotation template.

If the desired product is not readily visible, type the name of the
desired product in the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, and the option appears in the drop-down menu. Products can also
be found by clicking `Search More...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
from the drop-down menu.

:::: tip

`fa-trash`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(remove record)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon on the
far-right side of the line.

### Optional Products tab

Using *optional products* is a marketing strategy that involves the
cross-selling of products along with a core product. The aim is to offer
useful and related products to customers, which may result in an
increased sale.

::: example
If a customer wants to buy a car, they have the choice to order
massaging seats as an additional product that compliments the car, or
ignore the offer and buy the car alone.
:::

Optional products appear as a section on the bottom of sales orders and
eCommerce pages. Customers can immediately add them to their online
sales orders themselves, if desired.

# Sales quotations

A *sales quotation* or quote is a document sent to a customer that
outlines the estimated costs and terms for goods and services. Once
accepted, a quotation can be converted into a sales order, which serves
as the final agreement before delivery and invoicing.

## Sales flow overview

Quotations fit into a broader sales flow that connects different stages
of customer interactions from initial interest to payment.

The typical flow follows these steps:

1.  *Quotation*: A proposal sent to the customer with product details
    and pricing.
2.  *Sales order*: Created automatically when the customer accepts the
    quotation, confirming the sale.
3.  *Delivery* (if applicable): Products are shipped or services are
    delivered.
4.  *Invoice*: The final bill is issued based on the sales order or
    delivered products/services.
5.  *Payment*: The customer settles the invoice, completing the sales
    cycle.

This flow helps businesses track the entire lifecycle of a sale while
keeping information consistent across apps.

In Odoo, quotations are configured in the **Sales** app. They can also
be generated from other apps as part of the sales workflow:

- **CRM**:
  `Convert opportunities <../crm/acquire_leads/send_quotes>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} into quotes to follow up on potential deals.
- **Helpdesk**:
  `Generate quotes from tickets <../../services/helpdesk/advanced/after_sales>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} when offering paid services or products.
- **Subscriptions**:
  `Offer recurring services <../subscriptions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} before starting an automatic billing cycle.

## Sales quotations in business deals

Sales quotations serve as a key step in the sales process, bridging the
gap between a customer\'s initial inquiry about goods and services and
the final contractual agreement for payment and delivery. The quotation
also provides transparency in pricing, helping both parties negotiate
and finalize the terms before making a commitment.

Sales quotations play a crucial role in business transactions by
defining the scope and cost of what is being sold to the end-customer;
setting clear expectations on pricing, delivery, tax, and payment terms;
and providing a documented stage where the business deal can be
negotiated before agreed upon.

## Key components of a sales quotation

A well-structured sales quotation comprises the following:

- Quotation number and date: A unique identifier for tracking and
  reference, as well as the
  `dates of issue and expiration <sales_quotations/deadline>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}. In Odoo **Sales** app, the quotation number is assigned
  under a standard naming convention once it is confirmed.
- Customer information: Customer name and contact information, as well
  as
  `invoicing and delivery address <sales_quotations/different_addresses>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.
- Products and services: Itemized listing of items to be purchased,
  including quantity, specifications (as needed), and unit price.
- Payment terms and
  `pricelists <products_prices/prices/pricing>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: Configured agreements and rules for the pricing and
  payment of this particular sales quotation.
- Special pricing: Optional `discounts and promotional pricing
  <products_prices/prices/pricing>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to
  update and/or modify individual product lines.
- Total cost and currency: Summary totals of product or service and
  shipping prices, including relevant taxes.

In Odoo\'s **Sales** app, quotations can include additional details and
configurations that add more detail and information, such as
`quotation templates <sales_quotations/quote_template>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"},
`subscription plans <../../sales/subscriptions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, and `sales team referrer name
<sales_quotations/create_quotations>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

# Shopee order management

## Product catalog mapping

### New Odoo customers with no existing products

If you are starting a new Odoo database and your products are only on
Shopee, you can import your Shopee product catalog into Odoo.

1.  **Export Shopee catalog:** Use the *Mass Function* drop-down to
    export the product catalog from Shopee, ensuring it includes the
    Shopee SKUs.

    ![Mass Function drop-down in Shopee.](manage/shopee-seller-centre-product-extract.png)

2.  **Import into Odoo:**
    `Import <../../../essentials/export_import_data>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} the exported catalog into Odoo. During the import
    process, it is *crucial* to map the Shopee SKU to the *Internal
    Reference* field in Odoo. This field will serve as the link between
    your Shopee and Odoo products.

### Existing Odoo customers with products already in Odoo

If you already have products in your Odoo database, you\'ll need to map
your Shopee listings to your existing Odoo products.

1.  **Export Shopee catalogs:** Use the *Mass Function* drop-down to
    export the product catalog from Shopee (including Shopee SKUs) and
    `export <../../../essentials/export_import_data>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} your product catalog from Odoo (including *Internal
    References*).
2.  **Map in a spreadsheet:** Use a spreadsheet to map the products.
    Match the Shopee SKU from the Shopee export with the corresponding
    *Internal Reference* from the Odoo export. Create a column that
    links the Shopee SKU with the Odoo *Internal Reference*.
3.  **Update Odoo products:** Import the updated spreadsheet back into
    Odoo. Use the mapping you created in the spreadsheet to update the
    *Internal Reference* field of your existing Odoo products with the
    corresponding Shopee SKU. This establishes the link between your
    Odoo and Shopee products.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Product catalog synchronization between Odoo and Shopee is **not
automatic**. It is a **manual operation** that you must initiate. The
process differs depending on whether your products already exist in
Odoo.
::::

## Order synchronization

Orders are automatically fetched from Shopee, and synchronized in Odoo,
at **regular intervals**.

The synchronization is based on the Shopee orders status: only orders
whose status has changed since the last synchronization are fetched from
Shopee. This includes changes on Shopee only.

When an order is canceled on Shopee, it will update the order\'s status
in Odoo. On the other hand, if an order is canceled on Odoo, the change
won\'t be reflected on Shopee.

For every synchronized order, Odoo creates a sales order and a customer
(contact), as long as the customer hasn\'t been previously imported from
Shopee or doesn\'t already exist in the database.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The principal of the synchronization is to *only fetch orders that needs
to be shipped* (i.e., [SHIPPED]{.title-ref}, [CANCEL]{.title-ref},
[UNPAID]{.title-ref}, [COMPLETED]{.title-ref}).
::::

## Force synchronization

In order to force the synchronization of an order, whose status has
**not** changed since the previous synchronization:

Then, navigate to the Shopee account in Odoo
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Shopee
--> Account --> Shop`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Modify
the date for `Last Order Sync`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under
`Orders
Follow-up`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Be sure to pick a date that occurs prior to the last status change of
the desired order to synchronize and save. This will ensure
synchronization occurs correctly.

## Manage deliveries in `FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}

Whenever an FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant) order is synchronized in Odoo, a
picking is instantly created in the **Inventory** app, along with a
sales order and customer record.

When a picking related to the order is confirmed, you also have to click
on `Arrange
Shipment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in your Shopee Seller
Account in order to be able to generate and fetch the
`Shipping Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Tracking Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Shopee delivery statuses

Understanding the different Shopee delivery statuses is crucial for
managing your orders effectively. Here\'s a breakdown:

- **Ready to ship:** The seller can now arrange shipment for this order.
- **Shipment arranged:** The seller has arranged shipment online and
  received a tracking number from the third-party logistics (3PL)
  provider.
- **Shipped:** The parcel has been dropped off at the 3PL location or
  picked up by the 3PL provider.
- **Cancelled:** The order has been canceled.
- **Pickup failed:** The 3PL parcel pickup attempt failed. The seller
  needs to rearrange shipment, and the rest of the order fulfillment
  content.

![Shopee delivery status in Odoo.](manage/shopee-delivery-orders-status.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Unsupported for Non-Shopee Supported Logistics (NSSL)

This feature is not available for
`NSSL (Non-Shopee Supported Logistics)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
you have to manually create shipping label and tracking number via the
logistics provider\'s website/app. Check your region for list of
supported logistics (e.g.
[Malaysia](https://seller.shopee.com.my/edu/article/388)).

Shopee requires users to provide a tracking reference with each
delivery. This is needed to assign a carrier.

If the carrier doesn\'t automatically provide a tracking reference, one
must be set manually. This rule applies to all Shopee marketplaces.
::::

## Follow deliveries in Odoo

For `FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} orders,
the stock move is automatically created in Odoo by the Shopee connector,
thanks to the shipping status of Shopee.

![Stock move created for Shopee order in Odoo.](manage/shopee-wh-out.png)

### Order fulfillment process

This section describes the process of fulfilling Shopee orders within
Odoo, from order creation to inventory updates.

1.  **New order creation:** When a new order is placed on Shopee, it is
    automatically created in Odoo.
2.  **Arrange shipment on Shopee:** Before the order can be shipped, you
    **must** arrange the shipment through the Shopee platform itself.
    This usually involves selecting a shipping provider, generating a
    shipping label, and scheduling pickup or drop-off. Odoo does *not*
    handle the physical shipping arrangements; this is managed entirely
    within Shopee.
3.  **Fetch Shopee shipping label (delivery note):** Once the shipment
    is arranged on Shopee, Odoo fetches the generated shipping label
    (which serves as the delivery note). This label contains crucial
    information like the tracking number and is essential for printing
    and attaching to the package. The shipping label is imported into
    Odoo and associated with the corresponding sales order.
4.  **Validate stock out in Odoo:** After the shipping label is
    retrieved, you need to validate the stock movement in Odoo. This
    confirms that the ordered items have left your warehouse or
    inventory. Validating the stock out will decrease the stock levels
    in Odoo.
5.  **Inventory update on Shopee:** Finally, Odoo pushes the updated
    stock levels back to Shopee. This ensures that your Shopee listings
    reflect the current inventory, preventing overselling and keeping
    your product availability accurate. This synchronization keeps your
    Shopee storefront up-to-date with your Odoo inventory.

## Register payments

Since customers pay Shopee as an intermediary, creating a dedicated
*Bank* journal (e.g. named [Shopee Payments]{.title-ref}), with a
dedicated *Bank and Cash* intermediary account is recommended.

Additionally, as Shopee makes a single weekly or monthly payment,
selecting all the invoices linked to a single payment is necessary when
registering payments.

To do that, use the appropriate `Journal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dedicated to Shopee payments, and select
`Batch Deposit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as the
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then, select all the generated payments, and click
`Actions --> Create batch payment
--> Validate`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

This same action can be performed with vendor bills from Shopee
dedicated to fees/commissions.

When the balance is received in the bank account at the end of the
week/month, and the bank statements are recorded, credit the Shopee
intermediary account by the amount received.
::::

## Analyzing Shopee sales with Odoo\'s reporting

Odoo\'s dashboard consolidates sales data from all your connected sales
channels, providing a comprehensive overview of your business
performance. To specifically analyze your Shopee sales, you will need to
configure sales teams for your Shopee shops. This setup enables you to
filter and isolate Shopee sales data within the Odoo dashboard.

### Setting up sales teams for Shopee reporting

By default, the Shopee account\'s sales team is shared across all of
your company\'s accounts. To generate separate reports for specific
Shopee shops or marketplaces, you\'ll need to assign dedicated sales
teams.

1.  **Assign a sales team to your Shopee shop:** Navigate to the Shopee
    account configuration (typically found under
    `Sales --> Configuration --> Accounts`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}). Within the account details, assign a
    specific sales team to your Shopee shop.
2.  **Filtering Shopee sales on the dashboard:** Once sales teams are
    assigned, you can use the dashboard filters to view sales data
    specifically for your Shopee shops. Select the appropriate sales
    team to isolate and analyze your Shopee performance.

# Shopee Connector configuration

Odoo allows users to synchronize with Shopee Seller account in the
database, but users **must** have a registered **Shopee Seller account**
and a **Shopee Open account** prior to completing the configuration.

Set up an Open Shopee account by first going to the [Shopee Open
Platform](https://open.shopee.com/), and click the
`Get Access (Now)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button located in
the middle of the page.

::: title
Important
:::

Shopee Open Platform access and seller account requirements are
**regionally specific**. This means the rules, qualifications, and
processes differ from country to country. Before proceeding with Odoo\'s
Shopee Connector setup, verify the requirements for *your* specific
Shopee region.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Shopee Seller Status & Business Type:** You must have an active
  Shopee seller account (Individual or Registered Business). Your
  eligibility depends on your region and business registration.
- **Order Volume/Seller Tier (If Applicable):** Many regions require a
  minimum number of orders within a specific time frame or a certain
  seller tier (e.g., Mall, Preferred, Managed) to access the Open
  Platform.

**Action Required:**

1.  Identify your Shopee region.
2.  Locate the official Shopee documentation for your region. [Open
    Shopee Developer Guide](https://open.shopee.com/developer-guide/12)
3.  Carefully review the requirements for seller accounts and Open
    Platform access in your region.
4.  Ensure your Shopee account meets all the necessary criteria *before*
    proceeding with the Odoo Shopee Connector configuration.
::::

## Connect Shopee seller account to Odoo {#shopee/setup}

`Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
`Shopee Connector`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
([sale_shoppe]{.title-ref}) by going to `Apps`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Shopee offers several API endpoints for production and testing.
Selecting the correct endpoint is crucial for successful integration.
Choose the endpoint that corresponds to your marketplace location.

- `Shopee Production Endpoint (Singapore)`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: This is the primary endpoint for sellers in most
  APAC countries. Select this option unless you are specifically
  operating within mainland China or Brazil.
- `Shopee Production Endpoint (China)`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: This endpoint is exclusively for sellers operating
  within mainland China. It is designed to comply with local regulations
  and business practices.
- `Shopee Production Endpoint (Brazil)`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: This endpoint is dedicated to sellers operating
  within Brazil. Select this option if your Shopee store is based in
  Brazil.
- `Shopee Testing Endpoint`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This
  endpoint is for development and testing purposes only. Use it to
  simulate interactions with the Shopee API without affecting your live
  data. **Do not use this endpoint for production.**
- `Shopee Testing Endpoint (China)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  Similar to the general testing endpoint, this one is specifically for
  testing integrations related to the China-specific production
  endpoint. **Do not use this endpoint for production.**
::::

After selecting the correct API Endpoint in the
`Credentials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form, input your Open
Shopee `Partner ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Partner Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the corresponding
fields. Then click `Save And Authorize`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

You\'ll need your Open Shopee `Partner ID`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Partner Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
complete this step. Here\'s how to find them in the Shopee Open
Platform:

1.  **Log in to the Shopee Open Platform:** [Log
    in](https://open.shopee.com/) with the credentials you used to
    register your Open Shopee account.
2.  **Navigate to App Management:** Go to the
    `App Management`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, then
    select `App List`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
3.  **Select your app:** Choose the specific app you want to synchronize
    with Odoo (either your test app or your production app).
4.  **Find your credentials:** Within the app details, you\'ll find your
    Partner ID and Partner Key. These are the values you\'ll need to
    copy and paste into the corresponding fields in Odoo.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- **Copy carefully:** Copy the Partner ID and Partner Key accurately,
without any extra spaces or characters. These are case-sensitive. -
**Keep your key secure:** Your Partner Key is sensitive information. Do
not share it with anyone. Treat it like a password.
::::

## Authorization and account registration

After entering connecting the
`Shoppe Seller account to Odoo <shopee/setup>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, the authorization process begins.

### Shopee seller account selection/login

Upon clicking `Save and Authorize`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
Odoo redirects to the Shopee seller account selection page.

- **Already logged in:** If you are already logged in to a Shopee
  account, your email address or username will be displayed. Click on
  your account to proceed.
- **Not logged in:** If you are not logged in, you will be prompted to
  enter the credentials (email/username and password) of the Shopee
  seller account you wish to connect to Odoo.

### Granting access to Odoo

After selecting or logging into your Shopee seller account, you will be
directed to the authorization (or consent) page. Here, confirm that you
allow Shopee to grant Odoo access to your account and related data. This
step is essential for the integration to function correctly.

## Account registration and Shopee shop creation

Upon confirming access, Shopee redirects you back to Odoo. An indicator
appears, confirming that your Shopee account has been successfully
registered.

### Post-synchronization configuration

After the redirection, you should perform the following steps within
Odoo:

1.  **Rename the Shopee Account (Optional):** The newly created Shopee
    account in Odoo will likely have a default name. You can rename it
    to something more descriptive (e.g., the name of your Shopee shop)
    for easier management.
2.  **Set the Last Order Synchronization Date:** This setting determines
    the starting point for fetching orders from Shopee. Choose a date
    from which you want Odoo to retrieve past orders.
3.  **Configure Inventory Synchronization:** Decide whether you want to
    synchronize your product inventory between Odoo and Shopee. Enable
    the `Synchronize Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    option to automatically push stock updates from Odoo to Shopee.
    Disabling this option prevents automatic inventory updates.
4.  **Assign a Default Sales Team:** Assign a default sales team to your
    Shopee account in Odoo. This helps with reporting and order
    management.

With the Shopee account successfully registered, the marketplaces
available with this specific account can later be synchronized the exact
same way, and listed under the `Shops`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

## Shopee orders in Odoo

When a Shopee order is synchronized, only lines for items are created on
the sales order in Odoo. Each one represents one for the product that
was sold on Shopee.

![Shopee synchronized sale order in Odoo.](setup/shopee-sales-odoo.png)

Any necessary price reconciliation related to shipping or income versus
fees can be managed later using Shopee\'s weekly / monthly financial
reports, which can then be imported into the Odoo **Accounting** app.

The selection of a database product for a sales order item is done by
matching its `Internal Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (a
customizable product reference identifier in Odoo, like
[FURN001]{.title-ref}) with the Shopee *SKU*.

If no database product with a matching internal reference is found for a
given `Shopee SKU`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then a default
database product, *Shopee Item*.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To modify default products, activate the
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
navigate to `Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. In the `Connectors`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, under `Shopee Sync`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, find the `Default Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

## Product tax configuration

To allow for tax reporting of Shopee sales with Odoo, the taxes applied
to the sales order items are those set on the product, or determined by
the `fiscal position
<../../../finance/fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

Make sure to have the correct taxes set on your products in Odoo, or
have it done by a fiscal position, to avoid discrepancies in the
subtotals between *Shopee Seller Central* and Odoo.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

As shopee does not necessarily apply the same taxes as those configured
in Odoo, it may happen that order totals differ by a few cents between
Odoo and *Shopee Seller Central*. Those differences can be resolved with
a write-off when reconciling the payments in Odoo.
::::

## Add a new marketplace {#shopee/add-new-marketplace}

To add a new marketplace, follow these steps:

1.  **Navigate to Shopee Accounts:** Go to
    `Sales --> Configuration --> Accounts`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
2.  **Create a New Shopee Account:** Click `New`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} to create a new Shopee marketplace account.
3.  **Select the API Endpoint:** Choose the appropriate API endpoint for
    your local market. (Typically, this will be
    `Shopee Production Endpoint (Singapore)`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} unless you are operating in mainland China or
    Brazil. Refer to the documentation for details on endpoint
    selection).
4.  **Enter Credentials:** Your `Partner ID`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} and `Partner Key`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} are the same as those linked to your unique Open
    Shopee account. Enter these values in the corresponding fields.
5.  **Name Your Shop:** Give the new shop a descriptive name (e.g.,
    [Shopee Philippines]{.title-ref}) to identify it later.
6.  **Assign a Sales Team:** Assign a relevant sales team (e.g., [Shopee
    Sales Philippines]{.title-ref}) to enable advanced reporting
    capabilities.
7.  **Synchronize Your Account:** If none of your existing marketplaces
    are listed, click `Log in with another account`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} to synchronize a new one. This will initiate the
    Shopee authorization process.

### Automatic synchronization

Newly added marketplaces are automatically added to the list of
synchronized marketplaces. If a new marketplace does *not* appear in the
list after synchronization, it indicates that the marketplace is either
incompatible with the Shopee Open Platform or unavailable for your
specific seller account. Consult the Shopee Open Platform documentation
or contact their support for further assistance.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

While Odoo allows creating the same Shopee shop multiple times, only one
instance will function due to token limitations. To avoid order
management issues, synchronize each shop only once. For connection
updates, manually fetch orders first before re-establishing the
connection.

# Shopee Connector

The **Shopee Connector** synchronizes orders between Shopee and Odoo,
which considerably reduces the amount of time spent manually entering
Shopee orders (from the Shopee Seller account) into Odoo. It also allows
users to accurately keep track of Shopee sales in Odoo.

## Supported features

The **Shopee Connector** is able to:

- Synchronize (Shopee to Odoo) all confirmed orders, and their order
  items, which include:
  - Product name
  - SKU reference
  - Quantity
- Synchronize (Odoo to Shopee) all available quantities of your products
  (`FBM (Fulfilled by
  Merchant)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}).
- Support multiple seller accounts.
- Support multiple Shopee marketplaces (shops) per seller account.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The **Shopee Connector** is designed to synchronize sales orders data.
Other actions, such as downloading weekly/monthly income/fees reports,
handling disputes, or issuing refunds, **must** be managed from the
*Shopee Seller Central*, as usual.

# Automation rules

With subscriptions up-and-running, it is important to stay up-to-date
with customers. It is efficient to use automation to avoid having to
manually go through the list of subscribers to see how things are going.
That is where Odoo\'s *automation rules* feature comes into play.

The Odoo *Subscriptions* application allows users to set up automatic
emails, create tasks for salespeople, and even send satisfaction surveys
for subscribers to evaluate their experience.

## Create automation rules

To create an automated rule, start by navigating to
`Subscriptions app -->
Configuration --> Automation Rules`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. This is where all the automation rules for
subscriptions can be found.

The `Automation Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page shows
each rule\'s `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Action To Do`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, what the automated
rule is set to `Trigger On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to which the rule applies.

To view or modify any existing automation rule, simply click the desired
rule from this page.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When modifying an existing automation rule, Odoo \"grays-out\" the
`Action`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the form, and
provides the following warning: *Action data can not be updated to avoid
unexpected behaviors. Create a new action instead.*
::::

To create a new automation rule, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![The Automation Rules page in the Odoo Subscriptions application.](automatic_alerts/automation-rules-page.png){.align-center}

Clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} reveals a blank
`Automation Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form with numerous
fields to configure.

![A sample Automation Rules form in the Odoo Subscriptions application.](automatic_alerts/automation-rules-form.png){.align-center}

### Automation rule form fields

- `Action Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: title of the
  automated action rule.

#### Apply On section

The `Apply On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section dictates which
subscription orders/customers this automated action applies to.

- `MRR Between`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: designate a range of
  monthly recurring revenue to target.
- `MRR Change More`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: designate a
  change of monthly recurring revenue to target, in either percentage or

- `Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the status of the
  subscriptions to be included in this automation rule. The options are:
  `Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Quotation Sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Sales Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Cancelled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Stage goes from`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: designate when
  the automation rule should be activated using two fields that
  represent two different stages of the subscription.
- `Subscription Plans`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: choose
  specific subscription plans to target with the automation rule.
- `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select specific
  product(s) to target with the automation rule.
- `Customers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select specific
  customer(s) to target with the automation rule.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: in a multi-company
  environment, select a specific company\'s subscription data to target
  with the automation rule.
- `Sales Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the data of
  specific sales team(s) to target with the automation rule.

# Subscriptions and automatic payments

By default, the **Subscriptions** app will automatically generate
quotations and invoices for customers, but it can also support automatic
payments. Setting up automatic payments requires additional
configuration, including choosing an automatic payment provider and
either setting up a customer portal or an **eCommerce** website. Here\'s
an overview of how to get started.

## Setting up a payment processor that supports automatic payments

Setting up automatic recurring payments requires using a payment
provider that supports tokenization. Tokenization lets customers save
their payment details, such as credit card or banking account
information, for automatic billing. The following payment providers
support tokenization:

- `Adyen <../../finance/payment_providers/adyen>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}
- `Authorize.net <../../finance/payment_providers/authorize>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}
- `Flutterwave <../../finance/payment_providers/flutterwave>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}
- `Razorpay <../../finance/payment_providers/razorpay>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}
- `Stripe <../../finance/payment_providers/stripe>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}
- `Xendit <../../finance/payment_providers/xendit>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}

Here are the steps to setting up automatic payments.

1.  Choose a payment provider that supports tokenization.
2.  Follow the provider\'s own setup guide to create an account and
    begin configuring their API credentials in Odoo.
3.  `Enable <payment_providers/add_new>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    the payment provider.
4.  `Configure the payment methods <payment_providers/payment_methods>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} for the chosen payment provider.
5.  `Configure the tokenization <payment_providers/tokenization>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} for the chosen payment provider.

## How customers can set up automatic payments

Once these steps are complete, payment providers will be able to create
tokens with customers\' saved payment details during the checkout
process. Saved payment details can then be used for future online or
recurring subscription charges. Customers will also be able to log into
their `customer portal <../../general/users/portal>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and enter their payment information there.

Some payment providers will automatically save customers\' payment
information as part of the checkout process. Others will give them the
option to save their information for future payments. If customers
choose not to save their payment information, they will not be able to
make automatic payments.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Building an **eCommerce** website requires the
`Website <../../websites/website>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} app.
::::

## What happens if an automatic payment fails?

When an automatic payment fails, the sales order is updated with:

- a `Payment Failure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tag
- the `Contract in exception`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  checkbox ticked (in the `Subscription`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} section of the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} tab).

Being marked `Contract in exception`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
prevents scheduled actions from running, which keeps the system from
accidentally double-charging the customer if the automatic payment
actually went through. Because the status of the payment failed to
register with the system, users must manually check if the payment has
been made before automatic payments and other scheduled actions can
resume.

To do this, navigate to
`Subscriptions app --> Subscriptions --> Quotations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click into the desired subscription, then check
the Chatter to see if the payment was made.

If the payment *was not* made, first enter
`developer mode <../../general/developer_mode>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. Then, click the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and untick the checkbox next to `Contract in
exception`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Reload the sales order
and confirm that the `Payment Failure`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tag is gone.

If the payment *was* made, a new invoice must be made and posted
manually. This automatically updates the next invoice date of the
subscription. Once the invoice is created, enter
`developer mode <../../general/developer_mode>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and navigate to the new sales order. Click the
`Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and untick the
checkbox next to `Contract in exception`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Reload the sales order and confirm that the
`Payment Failure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tag is gone.

![](renewals/contract-in-exception.png){alt="The contract in exception option selected with the payment failure tag shown."}

The `Contract in exception`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option
selected with the `Payment Failure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tag shown.

In both cases, once the `Contract in exception`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox is no longer ticked, Odoo handles renewals
automatically again. If the subscription remains in
`Payment Failure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, it is ignored by
Odoo until the sales order is closed.

# Close subscriptions

Odoo *Subscriptions* provides flexibility for businesses to decide
whether customers can self-manage their subscriptions, or restrict that
ability entirely.

## Configuration

Start by navigating to
`Subscriptions app --> Configuration --> Recurring Plans`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. From there, either create a new plan by clicking
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or select an existing one to
modify it.

Once on the `Recurring Plans`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form,
enable the `Closable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, in the
`Self-Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, to allow
customers to close their own subscriptions using the customer portal.

![The Closable option on a recurring plan form in Odoo Subscriptions.](closing/recurring-plans-closable-option.png){.align-center}

## Close a subscription

### Administrator view

After a quotation for a subscription product has been confirmed, it
becomes a sales order, and the subscription status changes to
`In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

At that point, the ability to close the subscription becomes available,
via the `Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top of
the subscription order, near the row that contains
`In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and other stages. This
option is also available after the order has been invoiced and the
payment has been registered.

![Close subscription from an administration point of view with Odoo Subscriptions.](closing/close-subscriptions-administrator.png){.align-center}

Clicking the `Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button prompts a
`Close Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window to
appear, allowing administrators to input the reason for closing the
subscription, or choose from the drop-down menu of options in the
`Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![The Close Reason pop-up when the Close button is clicked in Odoo Subscriptions.](closing/close-reason-popup.png){.align-center}

When the desired `Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is entered,
click the `Submit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

Clicking `Submit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
`Close Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window updates
the subscription sales order to show `Churned`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} status tag, along with the specified `Close
Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Customer view

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

As an administrator, the ability to visualize what customers see when
managing their subscriptions is accessible via the
`Preview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, located at the top
of the subscription sales order.
::::

From the customer\'s point of view, in the customer portal, the
`Close Subscription`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is
located on the left side of the sales order.

![Close subscription button on a customer\'s view of a sales order in Odoo Subscriptions.](closing/close-subscription-button-customer-view.png){.align-center}

When the customer clicks the `Close Subscription`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, a `Close Subscription`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears, in which the customer has to
choose from a select list of reasons why they are choosing to close the
subscription.

![The close subscription pop-up window customers see when closing a subscription.](closing/close-subscription-customer-pov.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Customers can *only* chose a pre-configured reason why the subscription
is being closed. They can *not* enter a custom reason from the customer
portal. These selections can be adjusted by navigating to
`Subscriptions --> Configuration --> Close Reasons`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

Once the customer has chosen a close reason, they would click the
`Submit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the pop-up window.

Upon closure, the subscription order in the customer portal is tagged as
`Closed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In addition, the specified `Close Reason`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} appears on the subscription order in the
*Subscriptions* app in the backend (Administrator\'s view).

# Renew subscriptions

Subscription renewal is the process customers follow when they willingly
choose to continue a subscription product or service. Subscribers go
through the renewal process at different intervals \-- weekly, monthly,
annually, etc. \-- depending on the duration of the agreed-upon
contract. Most companies that offer subscriptions prefer to automate the
renewal process for customers. However, manual subscription renewals are
still used in some cases.

With the Odoo **Subscriptions** application, a company can manage all of
its subscriptions in one place. Renewals can be processed automatically
or manually, include additional products or upsells per renewal order,
and be filtered in batch views to locate customers who need to renew
their subscriptions.

## Create a renewal manually

In order to create a renewal quotation, there are certain prerequisites
that a subscription must meet.

- A quotation with a subscription product must be confirmed.
- A configured *recurring plan* must be selected.
- Payment from the customer for the initial subscription must be
  invoiced and registered.

To check if an existing subscription quotation meets the prerequisites,
navigate to
`Subscriptions app --> Subscriptions --> Quotations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the desired quotation from the list.
Properly configured subscriptions show as being in the
`Sales Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage, have an
`In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tag, and have the
`Renew`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the row of buttons
directly above the order form.

![Renew button on subscription sales order with Odoo Subscriptions.](renewals/renew-button.png){.align-center}

When the `Renew`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is clicked,
Odoo instantly presents a new renewal quotation, complete with a
`Renewal Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tag. Important
reference information like the start date and next invoice date are
automatically added to the renewal quotation\'s chatter.

From here, follow the standard sales flow to `confirm the quotation
<sales/sales_quotations/send-and-confirm>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `invoice the order
<../../sales/sales/invoicing/invoicing_policy>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, and `register payment
<finance/accounting/register-payment-invoice-bill>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Once the renewal quotation is confirmed, it becomes a sales order and a
`fa-usd`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Sales History`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button appears
at the top of the page. When the `fa-usd`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Sales History`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button is
clicked, Odoo loads a new page showcasing the different sales orders
attached to this subscription, along with their individual `Subscription
Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Subscription reports

The Odoo **Subscriptions** app provides a series of reporting pages to
help companies analyze how subscriptions are performing.

On the *Subscriptions Analysis* reporting page, users can view specific
data related to recurring subscriptions, quantity of subscriptions,
in-progress or paused subscriptions, and more.

The *Retention Analysis* reporting page provides an organized table of
subscription retention percentages over any period of time.

The *MRR Breakdown* reporting page clearly divides
`MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
`ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} metrics
for subscriptions into various graphs, lists, and charts.

And the *MRR Analysis* reporting page offers a time-based collection of
analytics showcasing how subscription
`MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
`ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} have
changed over the course of any given period of time.

## Reporting page elements

All subscriptions-based reporting pages can be accessed via the
`Reporting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} header menu in the
**Subscriptions** app.

The following sections describe elements found on each reporting page.

### Filters and Group By

*Filters* are used to narrow down metrics to show specific analytics,
whereas groupings (via the *Group By* option) are used to gather the
data from specific sections into groups for more organized analysis.

This section refers to both filters and groupings, as a combination of
the two can be saved in the *Favorites* section.

To modify the results being shown on any reporting page, click the
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the right of
the search bar. Doing so reveals a drop-down menu of detailed filter and
grouping options.

If desired, a filter or grouping (or combination of filters and/or
groupings) can be saved in the `Favorites`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section of that drop-down menu. To do so, click the
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon beside
`Save current search`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, located
beneath the `Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

This reveals a field to assign a title to the favorite filter. Two
options are also found beneath the title field:
`Default filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Shared`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Ticking the checkbox beside `Default filter`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} makes the newly-favorited filter the default option for
that reporting page.

Ticking the checkbox beside `Shared`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
makes the newly-favorited filter available to other users in the
database.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Default filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Shared`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options are **not**
required, and only *one* of these options can be selected at a time.
::::

To save the filter, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
the `Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
drop-down filter menu.

When clicked, that saved filter appears beneath the
`Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column of the drop-down
filter menu, and a `fa-star`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(gold star)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon appears beside the
favorite filter\'s name in the search bar.

### Views

On the `Subscription Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`MRR Breakdown`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`MRR Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} reporting pages, three
different view options are located in the upper-right corner.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

There are *no* other view options available on the
`Retention Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} reporting page.
::::

The available view options, from left to right, are:

- `Graph`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `List`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Pivot`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

![The different view options available on the Subscriptions Analysis page.](reports/subscriptions-analysis-page-view-options.png){.align-center}

Each view has its own series of related view-specific visual options.

#### Graph view

With the graph view selected, the following options appear between the
search bar and visual representation of the data. These graph-specific
options are located to the right of the `Measures`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Insert in Spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} buttons.

![The different graph view options in the Odoo Subscriptions app.](reports/subscriptions-graph-specific-options.png){.align-center}

The first three options, from left to right, represent different
graph-related views. The remaining options represent different ways to
organize and visualize that specific graph-related data.

From left to right, the specific graph-related view options are:

- `fa-bar-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Bar Chart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: showcases the data in
  a bar chart format.
- `fa-line-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Line Chart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: showcases the data in
  a line chart format.
- `fa-pie-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Pie Chart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: showcases the data in
  a pie chart format.

Each graph view option has its own series of specific visual options,
which are represented by the available buttons that appear to the right
of the selected graph-related view option.

When the `fa-bar-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Bar Chart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} graph view is selected,
the following visual options are available:

- `fa-database`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Stacked`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: showcases the data in a
  stacked visual format.
- `fa-sort-amount-desc`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Descending`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: showcases the data in
  descending order.
- `fa-sort-amount-asc`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Ascending`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: showcases the data in
  ascending order.

When the `Line Chart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} graph view is
selected, the following visual options are available:

- `fa-database`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Stacked`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: showcases the data in a
  stacked visual format.
- `fa-signal`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Cumulative`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: showcases the data in
  accumulated, increasing format.
- `fa-sort-amount-desc`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Descending`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: showcases the data in
  descending order.
- `fa-sort-amount-asc`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Ascending`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: showcases the data in
  ascending order.

When the `Pie Chart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} graph view is
selected, there are no additional visual options.

#### List view

With the list view selected, the subscription metrics being analyzed are
displayed in a simple list, which can be fully customized by using any
of the available filters or groupings in the drop-down filter menu
(accessible via the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the right of
the search bar).

:::: note
::: title

With list view selected, the `Measures`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu and `Insert in
Spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button are *not*
available.
::::

#### Pivot view

With the pivot view selected, the subscription metrics are displayed in
a data table, which can be fully customized.

The pivot data table can be customized using the options available in
the `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu, and/or
the filter grouping options available in the filter drop-down menu
(accessible via the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the right of
the search bar).

Three pivot-specific options are available, located to the right of the
`Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu and
`Insert in Spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![The pivot-specific view options available in the Odoo Subscriptions app.](reports/subscriptions-pivot-view-options.png){.align-center}

From left to right, those pivot-specific view options are:

- `fa-exchange`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Flip axis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the [x]{.title-ref}
  and [y]{.title-ref} axis of the pivot data table flip.
- `fa-arrows`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Expand all`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: all the available
  rows and columns of the pivot data table expand fully.
- `fa-download`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Download .xlsx`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the pivot data
  table is downloaded as an `.xlsx`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file.

### Measures

The graph and pivot reporting pages have their own metric-specific
`Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu of
data-related options to choose from, located in the upper-left corner,
above the visual representation of metrics.

![The standard measures drop-down menu in the Odoo Subscriptions app.](reports/subscriptions-measures-drop-down.png){.align-center}

When the `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is
clicked, a series of selectable measures becomes available, via a
drop-down menu. When any of the options are selected from the

# Scheduled actions

*Scheduled actions* are pre-configured processes that allow users to
automate certain tasks within a database, based on a designated schedule
or number of occurrences. These tasks can include sending emails,
generating invoices, data clean-up, and so much more.

In Odoo, some scheduled actions are active, by default, to ensure that
certain functions are triggered automatically, however there are *also*
many scheduled action options that appear in the database that are
**not** activated by default.

In Odoo *Subscriptions*, there are two scheduled actions that initiate
the billing process for active recurring subscriptions, as well as when
billing should stop due to subscription expiration.

They are turned on, by default and can be deactivated at any time in
order to manage subscriptions manually.

## Access scheduled actions

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

In order to access scheduled actions,
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} **must**
be activated.
::::

With developer mode activated, navigate to
`Settings app --> Technical --> Scheduled
Actions`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

![The scheduled actions option under the technical menu in the Odoo Settings application.](scheduled_actions/scheduled-actions-technical-settings-page.png){.align-center}

Doing so reveals a dedicated `Scheduled Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard. On this page, there is a complete list of
scheduled actions for the entire database.

From here, enter [Subscription]{.title-ref} in the search bar. Doing so
provides three subscription-specific results. The following
documentation focuses on the last two results in the list:

- `Sale Subscription: generate recurring invoices and payments`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `Sale Subscription: subscriptions expiration`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}

![The subscription-related results on the scheduled actions page in Odoo Settings.](scheduled_actions/scheduled-actions-page-subscription-results.png){.align-center}

Determine if a scheduled action is active by looking under the
`Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, in the corresponding
row on the `Scheduled Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
dashboard, for a ticked checkbox; if the checkbox is green with a check
mark, the scheduled action is active.

If a scheduled action needs to be activated, click into the desired
scheduled action from the list.

![The scheduled action form in the Odoo Settings application.](scheduled_actions/scheduled-action-form.png)

Then, from the scheduled action form, toggle the switch in the
`Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to the right. Doing so
turns the switch green, indicating that the scheduled action is now
[Active]{.title-ref}.

The ability to set up how often the scheduled action runs is also
available on the scheduled action form, in the
`Execute Every`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The scheduled action does **not** function correctly if the execution
time is less than five minutes. This is a general rule for all scheduled
actions.

For more information, read the `Frequent Technical Questions
</administration/odoo_sh/advanced/frequent_technical_questions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation.
::::

## Generate recurring invoices and payments

In order for the
`Sale Subscription: generate recurring invoices and payments`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} scheduled action to properly generate recurring
invoices and payments on subscriptions, the *Deferred Expense* and
*Deferred Revenue* accounts **must** be set up, in order for Odoo to
process various invoices and payments related to subscriptions.

To set up *Deferred Expense* and *Deferred Revenue* accounts, navigate
to `Accounting
app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Both accounts can be configured in the `Default
Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

![The necessary deferred account settings in the Odoo Accounting app\'s settings page.](scheduled_actions/deferred-settings-accounting.png){.align-center}

Once the correct accounts are entered in the
`Deferred Expense`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `Deferred
Revenue`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu fields, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the upper-left corner.

### Create invoice

Elements related to the
`Sale Subscription: generate recurring invoices and payments`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} scheduled action can be found on confirmed subscription
sales orders.

To examine these elements, open any confirmed sales order in the
*Subscriptions* application to reveal the subscription sales order form.

On a confirmed subscription sales order form, focus on the
`Recurring Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Date of Next Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields.

![A confirmed subscription sales order in the Odoo Subscriptions application.](scheduled_actions/confirmed-subscription-sales-order-fields.png){.align-center}

The scheduled action creates an invoice when today\'s date is the same
date as the `Date of
Next Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Odoo uses the information in the `Recurring Plan`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field to update the next invoice date accordingly.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

If the product invoicing policy is set to *Based on Delivered Quantities
(Manual)*, and the delivered quantity is [0]{.title-ref}, Odoo does
**not** create an invoice, and the customer is not charged.

Instead, the subscription is processed as a free recurring product, and
is reflected as such in the *chatter* of the subscription sales order.

When this occurs, the following message appears: [Automatic renewal
succeeded. Free subscription. Next invoice:\[date\]. No email
sent.]{.title-ref}
::::

Once the invoice for the subscription sales order is created, the
invoice can be viewed by clicking the `Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button that appears at the top of the
subscription sales order.

An email is sent to the customer notifying them of the recurring
subscription charge, *if* there is a `Payment Token`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the account.

To check if there is a `Payment Token`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, open the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and look at the `Payment Token`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, under the `Subscription`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section.

If there is no `Payment Token`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
invoice is created, and sent to the customer. The payment **must** be
registered manually in this case.

![The Payment Token field under the Other Info tab on a subscription sales order form.](scheduled_actions/payment-token-field.png){.align-center}

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

If the `Online payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox is
ticked on the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
invoices are **not** automatically generated by the scheduled action on
the date of the next invoice. Instead, invoices are generated when the
client completes the manual payments for the subscription.

To use automatic payment and automatically generate invoices, this
checkbox **must** remain empty.
::::

### Closing invoices

The
`Sale Subscription: generate recurring invoices and payments`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} scheduled action also has the ability to close a
subscription, if the following conditions are met:

- If the subscription has no `Payment Token`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, create and post the invoice.

- If the subscription has a `Payment Token`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, try to charge.

  > - If the charge is successful, create and post the invoice.
  >
  > - If the charge fails, send reminders periodically.
  >
  >   > - Close the subscription if it continues to fail for more than
  >   >   fourteen days.

## Subscriptions expiration

The `Sale Subscription: subscriptions expiration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} scheduled action checks for all other conditions that
may cause a subscription to close automatically. If certain conditions
are met, the scheduled action closes that subscription.

First, the
`Sale Subscription: subscriptions expiration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} scheduled action checks to see if the end date has
passed, which is configured on the subscription sales order.

![The expiration date on a subscription sales order in Odoo Subscriptions.](scheduled_actions/subscription-expiration-date.png){.align-center}

Then, the
`Sale Subscription: subscriptions expiration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} scheduled action checks if the invoice has not been
paid within the payment terms deadline.

To access the invoices attached to a subscription, access the sales
order for the subscription product, and click the
`Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button. Then, look
at the `Invoice Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

![The Invoice Date column on subscriptions invoice page in Odoo Subscriptions app.](scheduled_actions/invoices-invoice-date-column.png){.align-center}

Unpaid subscriptions with an `Invoice Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} that are past the determined number of days in the
`Automatic Closing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field of a
`Recurring Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are automatically
closed by the
`Sale Subscription: subscriptions expiration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} scheduled action.

![The Automatic Closing field on a Recurring Plan form in Odoo Subscriptions.](scheduled_actions/automatic-closing-field.png){.align-center}

For example, if the next invoice date is July 1st, and the
`Automatic Closing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to \'30
Days\', the scheduled action would close the subscription on August 1st.

# Upsell subscriptions

Subscriptions are recurrent, and go on indefinitely. As time passes,
customers may want to modify them. With that in mind, it\'s imperative
to have the ability to adapt prices, or change quantities, to
accommodate any need. That\'s where the opportunity to upsell a
subscription can come into play.

Upselling may prove beneficial to the following customer types:

1.  | *Loyal Customers*
    | These are customers who already trust the company/brand, and
      because they have established a pattern of paying for
      products/services, there\'s more confidence behind the attempt to
      sell them a more expensive product/service.

2.  | *New Customers*
    | For brand new customers unfamiliar with the company/brand, a new,
      attractive tactic must be employed to entice them to purchase a
      more expensive product/service.

    > In these instances, discounts can be useful. Typically,
    > subscriptions end after a certain period of time.
    >
    > So, if these more expensive products/services are offered to new
    > customers at a discount, it can result in a sale, while
    > establishing a strong sense of trust between the customer and the
    > company/brand. In turn, this can increase customer retention, as
    > they\'ll grow more comfortable and trustworthy over time.

## Discount configuration

In order to have the ability to upsell a subscription to a new customer,
with the aid of a discount, the *Discounts* feature **must** be
activated.

To activate the *Discounts* feature, navigate to
`Sales app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, scroll to the
`Pricing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and tick the
checkbox beside `Discounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then,
click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Activation of the discount option in Odoo Sales.](upselling/configuration-to-upsell-a-subscription.png){.align-center}

With that feature activated, the ability to grant discounts on sales
order lines.

### Upsell subscriptions

Before upselling a subscription, check out our documentation on how to
`Create a quotation
<../subscriptions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} using subscription
products.

When a quotation with a subscription is confirmed, it officially becomes
a sales order, and a new subscription is created in the Odoo
*Subscriptions* application.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The subscription sales order **must** be invoiced *before* an upsell can
occur.
::::

When the subscription sales order is opened, either in the *Sales* or
*Subscriptions* application, the ability to upsell that subscription is
available, via the `Upsell`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at
the top of the sales order.

![Upsell button for subscription sales orders with Odoo Subscriptions.](upselling/upsell-your-subscription.png){.align-center}

When the `Upsell`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is clicked,
a new quotation form appears, with an `Upsell`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} status banner in the upper-right corner. The initial
subscription product is already in the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.

There is also a warning reminding the user that the recurring products
are discounted, according to the prorated period of time, located
beneath the initial subscription product in the
`Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The prorated amount is **only** applied to *Service* product types. It
is **not** applied to *Consumable* or *Storable* product types, even if
the message appears.
::::

From this new upsell quotation form, add new subscription products in
the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, by clicking
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and selecting the
desired subscription product.

![Adding products to your subscription via the upsell option in Odoo Subscriptions](upselling/use-of-the-upsell-button-in-odoo-sales.png){.align-center}

Once the desired upsell subscription product(s) have been added, it can
be sent to the customer for approval by clicking the
`Send by Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When the quotation is confirmed by the customer, the upsell products are
added to the initial subscription. Quotation prices are then prorated to
the remaining time of the current invoicing period.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Before sending the new quotation to the customer, the unit price, taxes,
and even discount can be applied.
::::

Once the customer approves, click the `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the quotation, making it a sales order. When
that\'s clicked, a `Sales History`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
smart button appears, displaying how many sales orders are attached to
this initial subscription order.

When the `Sales History`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button
is clicked, Odoo reveals a separate page containing a list of the
related sales orders, clearly showcasing their individual `Subscription
Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Subscriptions

The Odoo **Subscriptions** app is designed to manage recurring revenue
through subscription-based products or services. It supports automated
invoicing, renewal management, and customer lifecycle tracking.

Subscriptions can be created manually or automatically through online
sales, with varying options for recurring billing. The app integrates
with other Odoo modules such as **Invoicing**, **CRM**, **Sales**, and
**Helpdesk** to support end-to-end subscription workflows.

:::

## Set up recurring plans

To get started with subscription products in Odoo, *recurring plans*
(previously known as *recurrence periods*) must first be configured.

Recurring plans are the time periods when subscriptions are active
before they need to be renewed again. While a subscription is active,
customers receive products or services, and may also have access to
additional benefits like support desk triage. Recurring plans also set
the interval when the customer is charged in order to maintain their
subscription.

To configure recurring plans, go to
`Subscriptions app --> Configuration -->
Recurring Plans`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

The **Subscriptions** app includes `Monthly`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `6 Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Yearly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as default recurring plan
options.

Create a new recurring plan by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the `Recurring Plans`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard. A new recurring plan form is generated with
the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and some
`DETAILS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filled out by default.
These can all be changed freely.

![A blank recurring plan form in the Odoo Subscriptions application.](subscriptions/recurring-plan-blank-form.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

[Days]{.title-ref} *is not* available as an option in the
`Billing Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu.
Recurring plans cannot be configured to bill on a daily basis.
::::

### DETAILS section

After giving the recurring plan a `Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, the plan can be customized by filling out the fields
in the `DETAILS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Only the
`Billing Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is mandatory
for a recurring plan to be saved.

- `Billing Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: determines the
  interval which the subscription is billed. Set the unit of time
  (`Weeks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Years`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) in the drop-down menu and
  the numerical value in the corresponding text field.

The following fields allow for further customization and refinement of
the recurring plan.

- 

  `Automatic Closing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: sets how many days it takes for the subscription to automatically

  :   close if payment is not made.

  ::: example
  If a subscription is set to renew on the 1st of every month, and
  `Automatic Closing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
  [15]{.title-ref} `Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then the
  subscription closes on the 16th of that month if payment is not
  received.
  :::

- `Align to Period Start`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: sets new
  and recurring subscription plans to bill on the first day of the next
  `Billing Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. When a
  subscription plan is purchased in the middle of a billing period, the
  invoice shows a reduced cost. Setting a custom period start dates
  (such as the 5th of each month) requires custom development and is not
  available by default.

  ::: example
  On the 15th of July, a customer purchases a monthly subscription for a
  streaming service. Selecting `Align to Period Start`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} for this recurring plan configures this subscription
  to bill on the 1st of each month instead of the 15th. The subscription
  begins as soon as payment is confirmed. The quotation shows the full
  cost of the subscription for July 1
  \- 31, but the invoice shows an adjusted cost for July 15 - 31. On the
  1st of August, the customer is charged the full price for the month\'s
  subscription.
  :::

- 

  `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: makes the recurring plan only available for the chosen company. By default,

  :   this option is blank and the recurring plan is available to all
      companies. Only one company may be chosen for this option.
      `Multi-company <../general/companies/multi_company>`{.interpreted-text
      role="doc"} functionality must be enabled to use this option.

- `Invoice Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: assigns a
  specific email template to be used in subscriptions invoicing
  communications. The default is [Invoice: Sending]{.title-ref} which
  contains dynamic fields that autopopulate specific variables across
  the `Subject`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field and
  `Content`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, such as the
  customer\'s name, invoice number, total amount invoiced, etc.

  :::: tip
  ::: title
  Tip
  :::

  Although this field is optional, using it is recommended since this
  type of communication fulfills good business practices around price
  transparency, regular communication (especially as relates to invoiced
  amounts), and financial documentation around recurring revenues.

  ![The [Invoice: Sending]{.title-ref} email template is accessible by
  clicking the `fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  (`Internal link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) that appears
  after hovering over the `Invoice Email
  Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field in the
  `Recurring Plans`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  form.](subscriptions/subscriptions-invoice-email-template.png){alt="An email template in Odoo used to send subscriptions invoicing messages to customers."}
  ::::

### SELF-SERVICE section

The following optional fields enable customers to take administrative
actions on their own subscriptions. Enabling any of these options may
decrease customer service request volume or increase customer lifetime
value (LTV).

- `Closable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: gives customers the
  power to close their own subscriptions without having to get
  assistance from sales or support teams.

  :::: tip
  ::: title
  Tip
  :::

  Although enabling this may reduce service requests and improve the
  customer experience, sales teams with strong customer offboarding
  processes may consider leaving this option unchecked to create more
  interactions that might save the subscription or a different form of
  recurring revenue (such as in the case of a lesser subscription or a
  new trial period with an alternative plan).
  ::::

- `Add Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: allows customers to
  add new products or edit existing product quantities to their
  recurring sales orders, thereby enabling customer-driven upselling.
  When enabled,
  `Upsell quotations <subscriptions/upselling>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} are generated whenever a customer performs a quantitative
  adjustment on their sales order product lines.

- `Renew`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: allows customers to
  manually create a `Renewal quotation
  <subscriptions/renewals>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} for their
  subscription.

- `Optional Plans`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: allows customers
  to switch their subscription plans from the current recurring plan to
  one of the values chosen here. This generates a new subscription or
  renewal quote to accommodate the change request.

### Pricing tab

Make product-specific pricing adjustments, as part of the recurring
plan, by adding them to the `Pricing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab order lines. Sequentially add the `Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, along with any respective
`Product Variants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and then assign a
`Pricelist`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (if available) and a
`Recurring Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Price rules that are added here take precedent over the default pricing
information on the subscription product\'s form. This is meant to
accommodate deals, discounts, and similar pricing adjustment strategies
that would incentivize customers to purchase the recurring plan.
::::

### Smart buttons

At the top of the individual `Recurring Plans`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} form, are two smart buttons to aid in navigating the
recurring revenue sources attached to the plan:

- `Subscriptions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: shows the number
  of active subscriptions sales orders that fall under the recurring
  plan. Clicking the button leads to a tabled list view, where each row
  hyperlinks to a respective subscriptions sales order.
- `Subscription Items`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: lists all the
  individual recurring subscription services that are active, in an
  itemized fashion. `Subscription`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  and `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} values repeat if the
  customer ordered multiple subscriptions on the same sales order.

## Product form configuration

With recurring plans set up, create a subscription product by navigating
to `Subscriptions app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Edit an existing product to edit or make a new
one by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open up the
subscription product\'s form.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When making a product in the **Subscriptions** app, the
`Subscriptions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is enabled by
default. Both the `Subscriptions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options enabled to sell the
product as a subscription product.
::::

![A basic subscription product form in the Odoo Subscriptions application.](subscriptions/subscription-product-form.png)

On the product form, configure the following items in the
`General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab so the
subscription product functions correctly:

- `Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: sets the product
  type to a physical good, a provided service, or a combination of both.
  This is typically set to a `Service`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} by default.
- `Invoicing Policy <sales/invoicing/invoicing_policy>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: sets when the customer is charged for their subscription,
  such as when the good or service is rendered, when the order is
  placed, etc.
- `Unit of Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: determines how
  the product should be counted in Odoo, for stock purposes. For most
  subscriptions, the `UoM (Unit of Measure)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} is `Units`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: sets the recurring
  cost of the subscription that the customer pays per recurrence period.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When creating a subscription for a physical good, selecting the wrong
`Invoicing
Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} will lead to errors when
creating invoices. Physical products must be set to
`Ordered quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

Optionally set up information on the `Attributes & Variants
<sales/products_prices/products/variants>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
tab if the subscription contains multiple choices for customers (i.e.
food delivery, tailored fashion boxes, etc.).

In the `Recurring Prices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
clarify the pricing options for the subscription. For each option
available, click `Add a price rule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to add a new row.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Longer `Recurring Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} time periods
usually feature discounts to incentivize customers to lock in a price
and create a predictable revenue stream for businesses.
::::

## Manually creating a subscriptions quotation {#subscriptions/quotations}

A new customer subscription can be created by going to either the
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}[ or
:menuselection:\`Subscriptions]{.title-ref} app dashboards, then
clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. On the quotation
form, fill in the necessary fields such as `Customer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Recurring Plan`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, as well as the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.

Additionally, any of the following can also be added to the quotation:

- `Expiration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} date: indicates when
  the subscription offer is no longer valid.

  :::: tip
  ::: title
  Tip
  :::

  Expiration dates pair well with
  `discounts <sales/products_prices/prices/discounts>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} to incentivize faster purchases, since the discount
  expires with the quotation if it is not turned into a sales order
  within the specified date range.
  ::::

- `Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: specifies a time
  frame by which the subscription must be paid once confirmed as a sales
  order.

![A completed example of a new subscription quotation in Odoo.](subscriptions/new-subscription-form.png)

## Confirmation {#subscriptions/confirmation}

Send the quotation to the customer for confirmation by clicking on
`Send By Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or confirm it
immediately by clicking on `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Click on `Preview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to preview the
customer portal where the customer can view their quotation, sign and
pay it, and communicate with you.

If an `Online signature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Online payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is required to
confirm the quotation, set the checkboxes next to either (or both) of
these labels in the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
under the `SALES`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

## Automatically created subscriptions quotations

Products that have been marked as `Subscriptions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on their product forms, and are also sold on the
**eCommerce** website *automatically* create and confirm subscription
quotations in Odoo. Sales orders with defined recurring plans
automatically become subscriptions.

# Creating field service tasks

Tasks in Odoo Field Service can be created manually or automatically,
including from sales orders or helpdesk tickets.

## Manual task creation

To create a new field service task:

1.  Open the Field service app and go to
    `Field Service --> All Tasks --> All Tasks`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
2.  Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
3.  Fill in the task title, `Customer`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} and any other
    `optional field <task_creation/task-configuration>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, then save manually.

## Task creation from a sales order

This feature allows for field service tasks to be automatically created
from a sales order. When you create a quotation with the
`service product <sales/invoicing/configured-service-product>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and confirm it, a task is automatically created in your
Field Service project. Click the `Tasks`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button to access it from the sales order.

## Task creation from a helpdesk ticket

If you have the Helpdesk app installed, you can
`create field service tasks from a helpdesk
ticket <helpdesk/field>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

# Planning an itinerary

By default, **Odoo Field Service** shows a static map where all task
locations for the day are pinned. To make it more useful for the field
service workers, it is possible to display an itinerary on the map using
MapBox. To do so, enable the **Map Routes** feature as follows:

1.  Create or sign in to a MapBox account using the following link:
    <https://www.mapbox.com/>.
2.  [Create a
    token](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens/#adding-url-restrictions-to-access-tokens).
3.  Go to the [Access tokens page on
    Mapbox](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/) and copy your
    token.
4.  In Odoo, go to the `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app
    and scroll down to the `Integrations`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} section. Paste your Mapbox access token in the
    `Token`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field under
    `Map Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
    `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Displaying your itinerary on a map

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

For a field service task to be featured on the map, a **valid address**
must be provided for the customer.
::::

To display your tasks on a map, go to
`Field Service --> My Tasks --> Map`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. To create your itinerary, Odoo sorts out your
field service tasks based on their `Planned Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to show the way from one location to the next.

To open your itinerary on the Google Maps website or app, click
`View in Google Maps`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Google Maps
includes your current location as a starting point for your itinerary.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- By default, the map shows today's tasks. Remove the
`Today`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter in the search bar to
display all tasks. Your tasks are then sorted by date in the left
column. - Click your task in the left column or the map pin to display
the task\'s details. From there, you can `Open`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} the task or click `Navigate to`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to get an itinerary from your current location to this
specific task\'s location.

# Product management

When field service workers perform tasks on-site, they commonly use
products to complete their work. Odoo Field Service allows them to
record these products using the **product catalog** and **default
warehouse** features. Doing so keeps your inventory up-to-date in
real-time and automatically adds the products to the invoice.

## Product catalog

To activate the product catalog for Field Service, go to
`Field Service -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
enable the `Time and Material Invoicing`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} feature.

To add products to a task, proceed as follows:

1.  Go to Field Service and open a task.
2.  Click the `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
    button.
3.  Click `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on a product card to
    add it to your task.
4.  If needed, adjust the number of products using the
    `-`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `+`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} buttons.

Going back to your task, the smart button now displays the amount of
products you added and the price. You can return to the product catalog
at any time to edit the product selection.

## User default warehouse

Setting up a **default warehouse** can be useful for field technicians
who keep a supply on the go in their van or those who always resupply
from the same warehouse. It also allows field workers to switch between
warehouses from their profiles.

Products in sales orders created during field interventions are always
pulled from the default warehouse, keeping the inventory accurate.

::: seealso
`../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Configuration

To set up a user default warehouse, the `storage locations
<../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/warehouses_storage/inventory_management/use_locations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} feature needs to be activated in the **Inventory** app. It
is also necessary to have more than one warehouse in your database.

You can either set it up
`for your profile <default-warehouse/my-profile>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, or `for all
users <default-warehouse/all-users>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

::: seealso
`../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/warehouses_storage/inventory_management/use_locations`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

### For your profile {#default-warehouse/my-profile}

To set up a default warehouse for yourself, click your **profile icon**
in the upper right corner of the screen, then, go to
`My Profile --> Preferences --> Default Warehouse`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select the default warehouse from the drop-down
menu.

### For all users {#default-warehouse/all-users}

To set up a default warehouse for a specific user, go to
`Settings --> Users -->
Manage users`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select a user,
then go to the `Preferences`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
Scroll down to `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
select the default warehouse from the drop-down menu.

![Selection of a default warehouse on a user profile.](product_management/user-default.png)

## Use in field service tasks

Once a default warehouse has been configured for a user, the materials
used for a sales order related to a Field Service task are pulled from
that specific warehouse. Open the related sales order, go to the
`Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, then scroll down to
`Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The default warehouse is
applied correctly.

Once the Field Service task is marked as done, the stock of the default
warehouse is automatically updated.

# Worksheets

**Worksheets** help your field service workers perform and report their
on-site tasks. They can feature various information, such as
instructions, to-do lists, etc. You can also format your worksheet using
checkboxes, bullet points, blank fields to fill in, HTML, and add files,
images, links, and more.

It is common for businesses to have their workers perform the same type
of field service repeatedly. Making custom **worksheet templates**
eliminates the need to recreate the same worksheet each time you plan a
similar field service task.

## Configuration

To use worksheets in Field Service, go to
`Field Service --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, enable the
`Worksheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature, and click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Worksheet templates are designed using **Studio**. Enabling the
`Worksheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature automatically
installs the **Studio** app, which may impact your price plan.
::::

### Create a worksheet template

To create your **worksheet templates**, go to
`Field Service --> Configuration -->
Worksheet Templates`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and give your worksheet
template a name. Manually save, then click
`Design Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open **Studio**
and customize your worksheet template.

In Studio, drag and drop the desired fields from the left column into
your worksheet on the right. To rearrange the fields on the worksheet,
drag and drop them in the desired order. Click a field to customize its
`properties <studio/fields/properties>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

When your worksheet template is complete, click
`Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the top right corner of
the page to leave **Studio**.

::: seealso
`Fields and widgets in Studio <../../studio/fields>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Add a worksheet template to a field service task

Go to your field service task, select a
`Worksheet Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

By default, the `Default Worksheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
template is selected. To define another default worksheet template,
click the `➔`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
(`Internal link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) icon that appears
when you hover your mouse over the `Project`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field on the task form.

![Mouse on project name to setup default worksheet template](worksheets/template-default.png)

Then, in the `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, scroll
down to the `Field service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section
and select the `Worksheet Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
you want to set up as default.

## Use worksheets on site

To complete the worksheet on site, access the task and click the
`Worksheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- As soon as you save a worksheet, the label of the
`Worksheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button on the task
changes to `Worksheet Complete`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
instead, even if some fields are left blank. - Any field defined as
`Required`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} has to be filled for a
worksheet to be saved.

# After-Sales services

*After-Sales* services can be configured in the **Helpdesk** application
for individual teams. Once enabled, users can
`issue refunds <helpdesk/refunds>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`generate coupons
<helpdesk/coupons>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`process returns <helpdesk/returns>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
`schedule repairs
<helpdesk/repairs>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or
`field service interventions <helpdesk/field>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} directly from a ticket.

## Set up after-sales services

Start by enabling the after-sales services on a specific **Helpdesk**
team, by going to
`Helpdesk app --> Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click on the team the services should be
applied to. Then, scroll to the `After-Sales`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section on the team\'s settings page, and choose which
of the following options to enable:

- `Refunds`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: issues credit notes to
  refund a customer, or adjust the remaining amount due.
- `Coupons`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: offers discounts and
  free products through an existing coupon program.
- `Returns`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: initiates a product
  return from a customer through a reverse transfer.
- `Repairs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: creates repair orders
  for broken or faulty products.
- `Field Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: plans onsite
  intervention through the **Field Service** application.

![The services that are enabled can vary based on the type of support a
team
provides.](after_sales/after-sales-enable.png){alt="The after sales options enabled on a helpdesk team."}

:::: danger
::: title
Danger
:::

Since all the after-sales services in Odoo require integration with
other applications, enabling any of them may result in the installation
of additional modules or applications. Installing a new application on a
One-App-Free database triggers a 15-day trial. At the end of the trial,
if a paid subscription has not been added to the database, it will no
longer be accessible.
::::

## Issue refund with credit note {#helpdesk/refunds}

A *credit note* is a document issued to a customer informing them that
they have been credited a certain amount of money. They can be used to
provide a full refund to a customer, or to adjust any remaining amount
due. While they are usually created through the **Accounting** or
**Invoicing** applications, they can be created through a **Helpdesk**
ticket, as well.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Invoices **must** be posted before a credit note can be generated.
::::

To create a credit note, navigate to a ticket on the
`Helpdesk app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click the
`Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the top-left
corner of the ticket form. This opens a `Refund`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

![View of a refund creation page.](after_sales/after-sales-refund-details.png)

Fill out the fields with the necessary information:

> - `Sales Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if a sales order
>   was referenced on the original ticket, it automatically populates in
>   this field.
> - `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the product the ticket
>   is about. If an item is selected in this field, only the sales
>   orders, deliveries, and invoices including this product can be
>   selected.
> - `Lot/Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field
>   is **only** visible if the `Product`{.interpreted-text
>   role="guilabel"} selected has associated lot or serial numbers.
> - `Invoices to Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field
>   is **required**. If no invoices are available in the drop-down, it
>   indicates this customer currently has no posted invoices, or the
>   `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} has no related
>   invoices.
> - `Reason displayed on Credit Note`{.interpreted-text
>   role="guilabel"}: this field automatically populates with the ticket
>   number, though it can be edited with additional information.
> - `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the accounting journal
>   where the credit note should be posted. After an invoice is
>   selected, this field defaults to the journal listed on the original
>   invoice, though it can be changed, if necessary.
> - `Reversal date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: when this field
>   is clicked, use the pop-up calendar that appears to select a date
>   for the credit note invoice. This field is **required**.

After the necessary fields are filled in, click
`Reverse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Reverse and Create
Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

`Reverse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} creates a credit note in a
draft state that can be edited before it is posted. This option can be
used to provide a partial refund.

`Reverse and Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} creates
a credit note that is automatically posted as well as an invoice in a
draft state. The invoice contains the same information as the original
invoice, though this information can be altered.

Once the credit note has been posted, a `Credit Notes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button is added to the **Helpdesk** ticket.

## Generate coupons from a ticket {#helpdesk/coupons}

Coupons can be used to alter the price of products or orders.
Conditional rules define the usage constraints of a coupon. *Coupon
Programs* are configured in the **Sales**, **Point of Sale**, or
**Website** applications.

:::: important

The **eCommerce** module **must** be installed to create coupon codes
from the **Website**.
::::

To generate a coupon, open a **Helpdesk** ticket and click on the
`Coupon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the top-left
corner. Select an option from the `Coupon Program`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu in the
`Generate a Coupon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
that appears.

![View of a coupon generation window.](after_sales/after-sales-generate-coupon.png)

To create a new `Coupon Program`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
navigate to `Sales app --> Products
--> Discount & Loyalty`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To make the program
available to share with **Helpdesk** customers, the
`Program Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} **must** be set to
`Coupons`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This generates single-use
coupon codes that grant immediate access to rewards and discounts.

Coupon programs can also be created in the **Point of Sale** or
**Website** applications. Refer to
`discount and loyalty programs <../../../sales/sales/products_prices/loyalty_discount>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for more information.
::::

Click on the `Valid Until`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and
use the pop-up calendar to select an expiration date for this coupon
code. If this field is left blank, the code does **not** expire.

Click `Send by Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to compose an
email to send to the customer with the coupon code.

Click `Get Share Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to generate a
link to send directly to the customer. Doing so opens a
`Share Coupons`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window. Click
the `Copy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to the
`Share Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field and paste the
results to any communication with the customer. When the customer uses
the link, the code is automatically applied to their cart.

After a `Coupon Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} has been
generated, a `Coupons`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button
is added to the top of the ticket; click the smart button to view the
coupon code, expiration date, and additional information.

## Return products {#helpdesk/returns}

Returns are completed through *reverse transfers*, which generate new
warehouse operations for the returning products. Click the
`Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top of a
ticket to open the `Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window.

The `Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button **only** appears
on a ticket if the customer has a recorded delivery in the database.
::::

Select a `Sales Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Delivery to Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to identify the
products that need to be returned.

By default, the quantity matches the validated quantity from the
delivery order. Update the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, if necessary. To remove a line, click the
`fa-trash-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(trash)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon.

Select a `Return Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} where the
items should be directed after the return is completed.

![View of a reverse transfer creation page.](after_sales/after-sales-reverse-transfer.png)

To confirm the return, click `Return`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. This generates a new warehouse operation for the
incoming returned products.

To exchange the received item with a new one, click
`Return for Exchange`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so
generates a warehouse operation in Odoo to deliver the replacement
product.

Use the breadcrumbs to return to the helpdesk ticket. A new
`Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button can now be
accessed at the top of the ticket.

## Send products for repair from a ticket {#helpdesk/repairs}

If the ticket is related to an issue with a faulty or broken product, a
*repair order* can be created from the **Helpdesk** ticket, and managed
through the **Repairs** application.

To create a new repair order, open a `Helpdesk`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} ticket and click on the `Repair`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the top-left corner. This opens a
`Repair Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form.

![View of a repair reference page.](after_sales/after-sales-repair-reference.png)

Fill out the fields with the necessary information:

> - `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field carries
>   over from the ticket, though a new contact can been selected from
>   the drop-down menu.
> - `Product to Repair`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if a product
>   was specified in the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
>   field on the ticket, it is added to this field automatically. If
>   not, click into the field to select a product from the drop-down
>   menu.
> - `Lot/Serial`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field is
>   **only** visible if the products being repaired are tracked, via lot
>   or serial numbers.
> - `Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: return order from which
>   the product to be repaired comes from.
> - `Under Warranty`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if this box is
>   checked, the sale price for all products from the repair order are
>   set to zero.
> - `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field
>   defaults to the current date. To select a new date, click into the
>   field and select a date using the drop-down calendar.
> - `Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: assign a user from
>   the drop-down menu to manage the repair.
> - `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: click into this field to
>   assign an existing tag or create a new one. Multiple tags can be
>   assigned.

If parts are required for the repair, they can be added in the
`Parts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Additional information
for the internal repair team can be added to the
`Repair Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

Once the form is complete, click `Confirm Repair`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. To create, edit, and send a quote for this repair,
click `Create Quotation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

A `Repairs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button is then
added to the ticket, linking to the repair order.

## Create field service task from a ticket {#helpdesk/field}

On-site interventions can be planned from a ticket and managed through
the **Field Service** application. Customers with
`portal access <../../../general/users/portal>`{.interpreted-text

worksheets enabled, and has a default template assigned, that template
automatically appears in the `Worksheet
Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down field. Even so,
the field can be edited, and another template can be selected.

If the **Field Service** project does **not** have worksheets enabled,

--- SOURCE: services/helpdesk/advanced/close_tickets.md ---

# Close tickets

After work has been completed on a ticket in the **Helpdesk** app, there
are several ways it can be closed. Manually closing solved tickets keeps
the pipeline up to date, while automatically closing inactive tickets
prevents unnecessary blocking issues. Allowing customers to close their
own tickets minimizes confusion around whether an issue is considered
solved or not. This results in increased operational capacity for
support teams, and higher customer satisfaction.

## Manually close solved tickets

As work on a ticket progresses, it is moved along to the next stage in
the pipeline. When the issue is solved, the ticket is moved to a
*folded* stage. This marks the ticket as *closed*.

To fold a stage, navigate to the `Helpdesk`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} dashboard and click on a team to open the
pipeline. Hover over a stage\'s heading, and then click the
`fa-gear`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(gear)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon that appears in the top-right corner of that
stage\'s Kanban column.

![View of stage on Helpdesk pipeline with emphasis on gear icon and edit stage option.](close_tickets/closing-edit-stage-gear.png)

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Clicking the gear icon also displays the option to
`Fold`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the stage. This setting folds
the stage *temporarily* to simplify the Kanban view. This does **not**
close the tickets in this stage. It also does not permanently fold the
stage. If a stage needs to be folded so the tickets can be marked as
closed, continue following the steps below.
::::

From the menu that appears, select `Edit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. This opens the stage\'s settings. Tick the checkbox
labeled `Folded in Kanban`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and then
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the
changes. Now, tickets are *closed* once they reach this folded stage.

> ![Stage settings page.](close_tickets/closing-folded-setting.png)

## Automatically close inactive tickets

Tickets that are inactive for a set period of time can be automatically
closed. At that point, they are moved to a folded stage.

Go to the team\'s settings page by going to
`Helpdesk --> Configuration --> Helpdesk
Teams`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Under the
`Self-Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, enable
`Automatic Closing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If only one of the team\'s stages is folded in the Kanban view, it is
the default selection in the `Move to Stage`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. If the team has more than one folded stage, the
stage that occurs first in the pipeline is the default for this field.
If no stage is folded, the default selection is the last stage in the
pipeline.

The `After days of inactivity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
defaults to [7]{.title-ref}, but can be adjusted if necessary.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

The `After days of inactivity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
does **not** take the working calendar into account when tracking the
amount of time a ticket has been inactive.
::::

If only certain stages should be used to track days of inactivity, they
can be added to the `In Stages`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

::: example
A team\'s pipeline is created with the following stages:

- [New]{.title-ref}
- [In Progress]{.title-ref}
- [Customer Feedback]{.title-ref}
- [Closed]{.title-ref}

Tickets can linger in the `Customer Feedback stage`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, because once an issue is solved, customers may not
respond immediately. At that point, the tickets can be closed
automatically. However, tickets in the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
stages may remain inactive due to assignment or workload issues. Closing
these tickets automatically would result in issues going unsolved.

Therefore, the `Automatic Closing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
settings would be configured as below: -
`Automatic Closing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: *checked* -
`Move to Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
[Solved]{.title-ref} - `After`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
[7]{.title-ref} `days of inactivity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} - `In Stages`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
[Customer Feedback]{.title-ref}

![Example of Automatic Closing settings.](close_tickets/closing-automatic-settings-example.png)
:::

## Allow customers to close their own tickets

Enabling the `Closure by Customers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
setting allows customers to close their own tickets when they determine
that their issue has been resolved.

Start by navigating to
`Helpdesk --> Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select a team. On the team\'s settings page,
scroll to the `Self-Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section
and tick the checkbox for `Closure by Customers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Customer closing setting in Odoo Helpdesk.](close_tickets/closing-by-customer-setting.png)

After the ticket closing settings are enabled, a
`Close Ticket`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is available
for customers when they view their ticket through the customer portal.

![Customer view of ticket closing in Odoo Helpdesk.](close_tickets/closing-customer-view.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Customers are able to view their tickets by clicking the
`View the ticket`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} link they receive
by email. The link is included in the
`Request Acknowledgment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} template,
which is added to the first stage of a team by default. This link does
not require a customer to have access to the portal to view or respond
to their ticket.

Customers with access to the
`portal <../../../general/users/portal>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
are able to view their tickets under
`My Account --> Tickets`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Odoo **Helpdesk** provides teams with the ability to track the amount of
hours spent working on a ticket, and to bill a customer for that time.
Through integrations with the **Sales**, **Timesheets**, **Project** and
**Accounting** applications, customers can be charged once the work is
completed, or before it has even begun.

:::: danger
::: title
Danger
:::

Since the *Track & Bill Time* features require integration with other
applications, enabling them may result in the installation of additional
modules or applications.

Installing a new application on a *One-App-Free* database triggers a
15-day trial. At the end of the trial, if a paid subscription has not
been added to the database, it will no longer be active or accessible.
::::

## Configure track and bill time features

Before a customer can be invoiced for support services, the *Track &
Bill Time* features **must** be enabled on each **Helpdesk** team
individually.

### Enable track and bill time on a helpdesk team

To view and enable the *Track & Bill Time* features on a **Helpdesk**
team, first navigate to
`Helpdesk app --> Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, select a team from the list, or create a
`new one <../../helpdesk>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. This reveals a
team\'s settings page.

On the team\'s settings page, scroll to the
`Track & Bill Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Check
the boxes labeled `Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Time Billing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

After the `Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box is
checked, a new field appears, labeled `Project`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If this is the first time this feature has been enabled on this
database, the page may need to be manually saved and refreshed before
the `Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears.
::::

The project selected in this field represents where all the timesheets
for this team\'s tickets are recorded. Click into the
`Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu to select a
project.

To create a new project where the timesheets are recorded, click into
the `Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu, type a
name for the project, and then click `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu beneath.

![View of a helpdesk team settings page emphasizing the track and bill time settings.](track_and_bill/track-bill-enable-settings.png)

#### Configure service products {#helpdesk/configure-service-products}

When the `Time Billing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature is
enabled, a new product is created in the **Sales** app called *Service
on Timesheets*. This product can be found under `Sales app-->
Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Then,
search for [Service on Timesheets]{.title-ref} in the search bar. This
is the product that is used when invoicing for *post-paid support
services* **after** they have been completed.

Select `Service on Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from
the product page. This reveals the product detail form. The product is
configured with the `Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
set to `Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
`Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set to
`Based on Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Make any
necessary changes to the product record, such as the
`Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Sales Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![View of a service product with the invoicing policy set to \'Based on timesheets\'.](track_and_bill/track-bill-product-based-on-timesheets.png)

In order to invoice for support services **before** the work has been
completed (also known as *prepaid support services*), a separate product
with a different invoicing policy must be created.

To create a new service product, go to
`Sales app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. This reveals a blank product detail form.

On the new product form, add a `Product Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and set the `Product Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to `Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then,
set the `Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Prepaid/Fixed Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This means an
invoice can be generated and payment can be received for this product
before any timesheets entries have been recorded for these services.

![View of a service product with the invoicing policy set to \'prepaid/fixed\'.](track_and_bill/track-bill-product-prepaid-fixed.png)

Finally, set the `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
confirm that the unit of measure is set to `Hours`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

## Invoice prepaid support services

When support services are billed on a fixed price, an invoice can be
created before any work is completed on the issue. In this case, a
service product with the `Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} set to *Prepaid/Fixed Price* is used, like
`the section above <helpdesk/configure-service-products>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### Create a sales order with prepaid product

To invoice a customer for prepaid support services, first create a sales
order (SO) with the support services product. To do this, go to
`Sales app --> Orders --> Quotations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to reveal a blank quotation form.

Then, fill out the quotation form with the customer information.

Go to the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
quotation and click `Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Then, select the *prepaid services product* when
`configuring the service product
<helpdesk/configure-service-products>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
Update the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field with the
number of hours.

After updating any other necessary information,
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the quotation. This
converts the quotation into an `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

### Create and send an invoice for prepaid services

After the `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} has been
confirmed, click the `Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button. This opens a `Create invoice(s)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

If no down payment is collected, the `Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} type can remain as `Regular Invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. If a
`down payment <../../../sales/sales/invoicing/down_payment>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is collected, choose between either
`Down payment (percentage)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Down payment
(fixed amount)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

When the necessary information has been entered, click
`Create Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The invoice can then be sent to the customer for payment.

### Create helpdesk ticket for prepaid services

To create a **Helpdesk** ticket for prepaid services, navigate to
`Helpdesk`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and click the
`Tickets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to reveal a specific
team\'s pipeline. Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
create a new ticket.

On the blank ticket form, create a ticket `Title`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and enter the `Customer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} information.

When the customer name is added, the
`Sales Order Item`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
automatically populates with the most recent prepaid sales order item
that has time remaining.

### Track hours on helpdesk ticket

Time spent working on a **Helpdesk** ticket is tracked on the
**Timesheets** tab on the specific ticket.

On the ticket detail form, click on the `Timesheets`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab and click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Choose an `Employee`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, add a `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
of the task, and enter the number of `Hours Spent`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

As new lines are added to `Timesheets`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, the `Remaining Hours on SO`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, at the bottom-right of the tab, is automatically
updated.

![View of the timesheets tab on a ticket with an emphasis on the remaining hours on an SO.](track_and_bill/track-bill-remaining-hours-total.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the number of hours on the `Timesheets`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab exceeds the number of hours sold, the
`Remaining Hours of SO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} turns red.

![An example of a ticket with the number of hours exceeding the hours remaining.](track_and_bill/exceeded-hours-sold.png)
::::

As hours are added to the `Timesheets`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, they are automatically updated in the
`Delivered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, as well.

## Invoice post-paid support services

When support services are billed based on the amount of time spent on an
issue, an invoice cannot be created before the total number of hours
required to solve the problem have been entered on a timesheet. In this
case, a service product with the `Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} set to `Based on Timesheets`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is used, like the one that is automatically created
after `the
Time Billing <helpdesk/configure-service-products>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} feature is enabled.

### Create a sales order with a time-tracked product

To invoice a customer for post-paid support services, first create a
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} with the *Service on
Timesheets* product. To do this, go to
`Sales app --> Orders --> Quotations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to reveal a blank quotation form.

Fill out the quotation with the customer information.

On the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Select the `Service
on Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} product. After
updating any other necessary information, `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} the quotation.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Unlike with the prepaid services quotation, Odoo does **not** allow an
invoice to be created at this time. Since services were **not**
performed, nothing was delivered, so there is nothing to invoice.
::::

### Create a helpdesk ticket for time-tracked services

To record a timesheet entry for time-tracked services, go to the
`Helpdesk`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, and select the
appropriate team for which these services apply.

If there is already an existing ticket for this issue, select it from
the Kanban view. This opens the ticket details form. If there is no
existing ticket for this customer issue, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to create a new ticket and enter the necessary customer
information on the blank ticket details form.

After selecting or creating a ticket, go to the
`Sales Order Item`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu.
Select the `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} created in
the previous step.

### Track support hours on a ticket

In order to create an invoice for a product based on timesheets, hours
need to be tracked and recorded. At this point, the service is
considered *delivered*. To record hours for this support service, click
on the `Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
ticket.

Click `Add a Line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to record a new
entry. Select an `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
drop-down menu, and record the time spent in the
`Hours Spent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

Repeat these steps until all timesheet entries have been recorded.

![View of the timesheets tab on a helpdesk ticket.](track_and_bill/track-bill-record-timesheet-hours.png)

### Create an invoice for hours tracked on a ticket

If no new timesheets are needed, then create an invoice and send it to
the customer.

To do this, return to the `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} by clicking on the `Sales Order`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button at the top of the ticket.

Before creating the invoice, confirm that the number in the
`Delivered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column matches the total
number of `Hours Spent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} listed in the
`Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on the ticket.

![View of a sales order with emphasis on the delivered column.](track_and_bill/track-bill-delivered-timesheet-hours.png)

Then, click `Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This
opens a `Create invoice(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window.

If no down payment is collected, the `Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} type can remain as `Regular Invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. If a down payment is collected, choose between either
`Down
payment (percentage)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Down payment (fixed amount)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Use the `Timesheets Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field if
this invoice should **only** include timesheets from a certain time
period. If this field is left blank, **all** applicable timesheets that
have not yet been invoiced are included.
::::

When the necessary information has been entered, click
`Create Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The invoice can then
be reviewed, edited, and sent to the customer for payment.

# Help Center

Odoo **Helpdesk** integrates with the **Forums**, **eLearning**, and
**Knowledge** apps to create the *Help Center*. The *Help Center* is a
centralized location where teams and customers can search for and share
detailed information about products and services.

![Overview of the settings page of a team emphasizing the Help Center features.](help_center/help-center-enable-features.png)

## Configuration

To activate any of the *Help Center* features on a *Helpdesk* team, go
to `Helpdesk
app --> Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select a team, or create a `new one
<../../helpdesk>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. Verify the
`Visibility`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the team is set to
`Invited portal
users and all internal users (public)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `Visibility & Assignment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section.

Additionally, the `Website Form`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option on the **Helpdesk** team form **must** be enabled to activate any
of the *Help Center* features. When one or more of the *Help Center*
features is enabled, the `Website Form`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is automatically enabled, as well.

:::: danger
::: title
Danger
:::

Since all of the *Help Center* features require integration with other
applications, enabling any of them may result in the installation of
additional modules or applications.

Installing a new application on a *One-App-Free* database will trigger a
15-day trial. At the end of the trial, if a [paid
subscription](https://www.odoo.com/pricing) has **not** been added to
the database, it will no longer be active or accessible.
::::

::: seealso
`Helpdesk Overview <../../helpdesk>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}

## Knowledge

Odoo\'s **Knowledge** application is a collaborative library, where
users can store, edit, and share information. The **Knowledge** app can
be used to publish user guides and `FAQs (Frequently
Asked Questions)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} with customers
externally, while also collaborating internally on shared documents.

The **Knowledge** app is accessible throughout the database by clicking
on the `Knowledge
(bookmark)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon.

![The Knowledge app is represented by the bookmark
icon.](help_center/help-center-knowledge-bookmark-icon.png){alt="View of a message in Helpdesk focusing on the Knowledge bookmark icon."}

### Enable Knowledge on a Helpdesk team

To enable the **Knowledge** feature on a *Helpdesk* team, go to
`Helpdesk app -->
Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select a team, or create a
`new one <../../helpdesk>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

When a team has been selected or created, Odoo displays that team\'s
detail form.

On the team\'s detail form, scroll down to the
`Help Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Then, click
the box next to `Knowledge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
activate the **Knowledge** feature. When clicked, a new field labeled,
`Article`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears.

Clicking the `Article`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field reveals
a drop-down menu. At first, there is only one option in the drop-down
menu titled `Help`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which Odoo
provides by default. Select `Help`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
from the drop-down menu to choose this article.

:::: tip

To create a new article, go to the `Knowledge app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then hover the cursor next to the
`Workspace`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section heading, located
in the left sidebar. Moving the cursor there reveals a hidden
`fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(plus)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon.

Click the `fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(plus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to create a new article
in the `Workspace`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click the
`fa-share-alt`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Share`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon, and slide the `Share to Web`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} toggle switch until it reads

### Search articles from a Helpdesk ticket

When members of a **Helpdesk** team are trying to solve a ticket, they
can search through the content in the **Knowledge** app for more
information on the issue.

To search **Knowledge** articles, open a ticket --- either from the
**Helpdesk** app dashboard, or by going to
`Helpdesk app --> Tickets --> All Tickets`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then select a ticket from the list.

When a ticket is selected, Odoo reveals that ticket\'s detail form.

Click the `Knowledge (bookmark)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon, located at the top-right of the page, to open a pop-up search
window.

![View of knowledge search window from a helpdesk ticket.](help_center/help-center-knowledge-search.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

**Knowledge** articles can also be searched by pressing
`Ctrl + K`{.interpreted-text role="command"} to open the command
palette, then typing `?`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"}, followed by the
name of the desired article.
::::

When Odoo reveals the desired article, click it, or highlight the
`Article`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} title, and press
`Enter`{.interpreted-text role="command"}. This will open the article in
the `Knowledge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} application.

To open the article in a new tab, press `Ctrl + Enter`{.interpreted-text
role="command"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If a more in-depth search is required, press `Alt + B`{.interpreted-text
role="command"}. That reveals a separate page, in which a more detailed
search can occur.
::::

#### Share an article to the Help Center

To make a **Knowledge** article available to customers and website
visitors, it **must** be published.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Even though the *Help* article has been enabled on a team, Odoo does
**not** share all the nested articles to the web. Individual articles
intended for customers **must** be published for them to be viewable on
the website.
::::

To publish an article, navigate to the desired article, by following the
above steps, and click the `fa-share-alt`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Share`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon. This reveals a menu.
Slide the toggle button labeled `Share to Web`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to read `Article Published`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![View of a knowledge article focused on sharing and publishing options.](help_center/help-center-knowledge-sharing.png)

### Solve tickets with a clipboard box

*Clipboard* boxes can be added to **Knowledge** articles to allow
content to be reused, copied, sent as messages, or added to the
description on a ticket. This allows teams to maintain consistency when
answering customer tickets, and minimize the amount of time spent on
responding to repeat questions.

#### Add clipboard boxes to articles

To create a clipboard box, go to
`Knowledge app --> Help`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Click
on an existing nested article or create a new one by clicking the
`fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(plus)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon next to *Help*.

Type `/`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} to open the *powerbox*, and view
a drop-down list of `commands
<knowledge/articles_editing/commands>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
Select or type `clipboard`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"}. A gray block
is then added to the page. Add any necessary content to this block.

![View of a clipboard in knowledge with focus on send and copy options.](help_center/help-center-knowledge-clipboard-options.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Clipboard boxes only display the `Use as description`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Send as Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
options if they are accessed directly from the **Helpdesk**.
::::

#### Use clipboard boxes in tickets

Clipboard boxes can be used to respond directly to a **Helpdesk** ticket
as a message, or to add information to the ticket\'s description.

To use clipboard boxes in a **Helpdesk** ticket, first, open a ticket,
either from the `Helpdesk`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard
or by going to `Helpdesk app --> Tickets --> All
Tickets`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and selecting a ticket
from the list.

Click on the `Knowledge (bookmark)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon in the top-right corner. This opens a search window. In this search
window, select, or search, for the desired article. Doing so reveals
that article page in the Odoo **Knowledge** application.

To use a clipboard box to respond to a ticket, click
`Send as message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the upper-right
corner of the clipboard box, located in the body of the article.

Doing so opens a `Compose Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window. In this window, select the recipients, make any necessary
additions or edits to the clipboard content, then click
`Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To use a clipboard box to add information to a ticket\'s description,
click `Use as
description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the upper-right
corner of the clipboard box, located in the body of the article. Doing
so does **not** replace the existing text in a ticket\'s description.
The content from the clipboard box is added as additional text.

## Community Forum {#helpdesk/forum}

A *Community Forum* provides a space for customers to answer each
other\'s questions and share information. By integrating a forum with a
**Helpdesk** team, tickets submitted by customers can be converted to
posts and shared.

### Enable forums on a Helpdesk team

To enable `Community Forums`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on a
**Helpdesk** team, start by navigating to
`Helpdesk app --> Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams`{.interpreted-text

option Odoo automatically created when the
`Community Forums`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature was
enabled. Select `Help`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
drop-down menu to enable that forum.

To create a new forum, type a name into the blank
`Forums`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, then click the
`Create and Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. Multiple
forums can be selected in this field.

`Forum`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} post and
`Title`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be edited to correct any
typos, or modified to remove any proprietary or client information.

`Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can also be added to help
organize the post in the forum, making it easier for users to locate
during a search. When all adjustments have been made, click `Create and
View Post`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## eLearning

Odoo **eLearning** courses offer customers additional training and
content in the form of videos, presentations, and
certifications/quizzes. Providing additional training enables customers
to work through issues and find solutions on their own. They can also
develop a deeper understanding of the services and products they are
using.

### Enable eLearning courses on a Helpdesk team

To enable **eLearning** courses on a **Helpdesk** team, go to
`Helpdesk app -->
Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select a team, or create a
`new one <../../helpdesk>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

On the team\'s settings page, scroll to the
`Help Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and check the
box next to `eLearning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. A new field
appears below, labeled `Courses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Click the empty field next to `Courses`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} beneath the `eLearning`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} feature to reveal a drop-down menu. Select an available
course from the drop-down menu, or type a title into the field, and
click `Create and edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a
new course from this page. Multiple courses can be assigned to a single
team.

### Create an eLearning course

A new **eLearning** course can be created from the
`Helpdesk`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} team\'s settings page, as
in the step above, or from the **eLearning** app.

To create a course directly through the **eLearning** application,
navigate to `eLearning --> New`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
This reveals a blank course template that can be customized and modified
as needed.

On the course template page, add a `Course Title`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and below that, `Tags`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Click on the `Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

Under `Access Rights`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select which
users are able to view and enroll in the course.

The `Show Course To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field defines
who can access the courses. The `Enroll
Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field specifies how they can
register for the course.

Under `Display`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, choose the preferred
course `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Publish an eLearning course

To allow customers to enroll in a course, both the course and the
contents **must** be published.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If the course is published, but the contents of the course are **not**
published, customers can enroll in the course on the website, but they
are **not** able to view any of the course content. Knowing this, it may
be beneficial to publish the course first, if the course contents are
intended to be released over time, such as classes with a weekly
schedule.
::::

To make the entire course available at once, each piece of course
content must be published first, then the course can be published.

To publish a course, choose a course from the **eLearning** dashboard.
On the course template page, click the `Go to Website`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button.

This will reveal the front end of the course\'s web page. At the top of
the course web page, move the `Unpublished`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} toggle switch to `Published`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

#### Publish eLearning course contents from the back-end

To publish **eLearning** course content from the back-end, choose a
course from the **eLearning** dashboard. On the course template page,
click the `Published Contents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button.

Doing so reveals a separate page displaying all the published content
related to that course. Remove the default `Published`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} filter from the search bar in the upper-right corner,
to reveal all the content related to the course - even the non-published
content.

Click the `oi-view-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(list)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to switch to list view.

While in list view, there is a checkbox on the far-left of the screen,
above the listed courses, to the left of the `Title`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column title. When that checkbox is clicked, all the
course contents are selected at once.

With all the course content selected, click any of the boxes in the
`Is Published`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. This reveals a
pop-up window, asking for confirmation that all selected records are
intended to be published. Click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to automatically publish all course content.

# Customer ratings

Asking customers to rate the support they received from a **Helpdesk**
team provides an opportunity to gauge team performance and track
customer satisfaction.

## Enable customer ratings on Helpdesk teams {#helpdesk/enable-ratings}

To enable *customer ratings* on a helpdesk team, navigate to
`Helpdesk app -->
Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click on a team from the list to open the
settings page. Scroll to the `Performance`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, and tick the
`Customer Ratings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

![Overview of the settings page of a helpdesk team emphasizing the rating on ticket feature
in Odoo Helpdesk.](ratings/ratings-enable.png)

## Set a ratings request email template on a stage

To automatically request ratings from customers once their tickets have
closed, an email template needs to be added to the appropriate stage.

After the `Customer Ratings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`setting has been enabled <helpdesk/enable-ratings>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} on the team\'s settings page, click the
`Set an Email Template on Stages`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
link. Select a stage from the list, or click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to create a new stage.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Customers should only be asked to rate tickets once an issue has been
resolved and their ticket is *closed*. Therefore, a *ratings request*
email should **only** be added to a stage that is folded in the Kanban,
as tickets in a *folded stage* are considered closed.
::::

On the stage\'s settings page, select the template, [Helpdesk: Ticket
Rating Request]{.title-ref} in the `Email Template`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. This template has been preconfigured with
ratings customers can use to provide feedback. To view the template,
click the arrow button to the right of the field.

After the template is added to the stage, it automatically sends a
message when a ticket is moved to that stage. Customers are then asked
to rate the support they received with colored icons.

> - **Satisfied** - green `fa-smile-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
>   `(smile)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon
> - **Okay** - yellow `fa-meh-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
>   `(neutral)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon
> - **Dissatisfied** - red `fa-frown-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
>   `(frown)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon

![A preview of the ticket rating request template in Helpdesk.](ratings/template-preview.png)

After selecting a rating, customers are taken to a webpage where they
can provide specific written feedback to support their rating. The
rating is then submitted, and the rating, as well as any additional
comments, are added to the chatter on the ticket.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Customer ratings can also be viewed through the
`Customer Ratings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report. To view
this report, go to
`Helpdesk app --> Reporting --> Customer Ratings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

# Receiving tickets

Odoo\'s **Helpdesk** app offers multiple channels where customers can
reach out for assistance, such as email, live chat, and through a
website\'s submission form. The variety of these contact options
provides customers with multiple opportunities to receive support
quickly while also allowing the support team to manage multi-channel
support tickets from one central location.

## Enable channel options to submit tickets

Go to
`Helpdesk app --> Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and choose an existing team, or click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`create a new team <../../helpdesk>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

On the team\'s settings page, scroll down to the
`Channels`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Help Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sections. Enable one or
more channels by checking the respective boxes.

- `Email Alias <helpdesk/receiving_tickets/email-alias>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Live Chat <helpdesk/receiving_tickets/live-chat>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Website Form <helpdesk/receiving_tickets/website-form>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}

### Email Alias {#helpdesk/receiving_tickets/email-alias}

The *Email Alias* setting creates tickets from messages sent to that
team\'s specified email alias.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The following steps are for **Odoo Online** and **Odoo.sh** databases.
For **On-premise** databases, external servers are required for email
aliases.
::::

When a new **Helpdesk** team is created, an email alias is created for
it. This alias can be changed on the team\'s settings page.

To change a **Helpdesk** team\'s email alias, navigate to
`Helpdesk app -->
Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click on a team name to open its settings
page.

Then, scroll to `Channels --> Email Alias`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. In the `Alias`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, type the desired name for the team\'s email alias.

![View of the settings page of a Helpdesk team emphasizing the email alias feature in Odoo
Helpdesk.](receiving_tickets/receiving-tickets-email-alias.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Custom email domains are **not** required in order to use an email
alias, however, they can be configured through the **Settings** app.

If the database does not have a custom domain already configured, click
`Set an Alias
Domain`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to be redirected to the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page. From there, enable
`Custom
Email Servers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

When an email is received, the subject line becomes the title of a new
**Helpdesk** ticket. The body of the email is also added to the ticket,
under the `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and in
the ticket\'s chatter.

### Live Chat {#helpdesk/receiving_tickets/live-chat}

The **Live Chat** feature lets website visitors connect directly with a
support agent or chatbot. **Helpdesk** tickets can be instantly created
during these conversations using the `response
command </applications/websites/livechat/responses>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} [/ticket]{.title-ref}.

To enable **Live Chat**, navigate to the
`Helpdesk app --> Configuration --> Helpdesk
Teams`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} list view, select a team,
and on the team\'s settings page, click the checkbox next to
`Live Chat`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, under the
`Channels`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If this is the first time
`Live Chat </applications/websites/livechat>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} has been enabled on the database, the page may need to be
saved manually and refreshed before any further steps can be taken.
::::

After the `Live Chat`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting is
enabled on a **Helpdesk** team, a new **Live Chat** channel is created.
Click on `Configure Live Chat Channel`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to update the channel\'s settings.

#### Live Chat channel configuration

On the channel\'s settings page, `Channel Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} can be edited, though, Odoo names the channel to match
the **Helpdesk** team name, by default.

::: example
If a **Helpdesk** team is named [Customer Care]{.title-ref}, a **Live
Chat** channel is created called [Customer Care]{.title-ref}.

![View of the Kanban cards for the available Live Chat channels.](receiving_tickets/receiving-tickets-live-chat-new-channel.png)
:::

On the channel form, navigate through the tabs to complete the setup.

##### Operators tab

*Operators* are the users who act as agents and respond to live chat
requests from customers. The user who created the live chat channel is
added by default.

To add additional users, click on the `Operators`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, then click `Add`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Click the checkbox next to the users to be added on the
`Add: Operators`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window that
appears, then click `Select`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create new operators,
if needed.

When the desired addition is complete, click
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Save & New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add multiple new
operators.

:::: danger
::: title
Danger
:::

Creating a new user can impact the status of an Odoo subscription, as
the total number of users in a database counts towards the billing rate.
Proceed with caution before creating a new user. If a user already
exists, adding them as an operator will **not** alter the subscription
or billing rate for a database.
::::

Additionally, current operators can be edited or removed by clicking on
their respective boxes in the `Operators`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and then adjusting their form values on the pop-up
form that appears, or by using one of the buttons located at the bottom
of the form, such as `Remove`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Users can add themselves as an operator by clicking the
`Join Channel`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on a **Live
Chat** channel.

![View of a live chat channel Kanban card with the join button emphasized.](receiving_tickets/receiving-tickets-join-live-chat.png)
::::

##### Options tab

The `Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab contains the visual
and text settings for the live chat window.

![View of the options tab of a Live Chat channel\'s settings.](receiving_tickets/receiving-tickets-options-tab.png)

- `Notification Text`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field
  updates the greeting displayed in the text bubble when the live chat
  button appears on the website.
- `Livechat Button Color`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field
  alters the color of the live chat button as it appears on the website.
  To change the color, click on a color bubble to open the color
  selection window, then click and drag the circle along the color
  gradient. Click out of the selection window once complete. Click the
  refresh icon to the right of the color bubbles to reset the colors to
  the default selection.
- `Show`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The chat button displays on
  the selected page.
- `Show with notification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The chat
  button is displayed, with the addition of the
  `Notification text`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
  `Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
- `Open automatically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The chat
  button is displayed, and automatically opens the chat window after a
  designated amount of time. The amount of time is designated in the
  `Open
  automatically timer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, which
  appears only when this display option is selected.
- `Hide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The chat button is hidden
  from display on the webpage.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Color selection, for the button or header, can be made manually, or
through RGB, HSL, or HEX code selection. Different options are
available, depending on the operating system or browser.
::::

##### Channel Rules tab

The `Channel Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab determines
when the live chat window opens on the website by logic of when a
`URL Regex`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} action is triggered
(e.g., a page visit).

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

A regex, or regular expression, is sometimes referred to as a rational
expression. It is a sequence of characters that specifies a match
pattern in text. A match is made within the given range of numbers or
for the set of characters.
::::

Edit existing rules by selecting them from the
`Channel Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, or create a new
rule by clicking `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then, proceed to configure the details for how the rule should apply on
the pop-up form that appears.

Choose how the *Live Chat Button* displays on the webpage.

- `Show`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The chat button displays on
  the selected page.
- `Show with notification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The chat
  button is displayed, with the addition of the
  `Notification text`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
  `Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
- `Open automatically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The chat
  button is displayed, and automatically opens the chat window after a
  designated amount of time. The amount of time is designated in the
  `Open
  automatically timer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, which
  appears only when this display option is selected.
- `Hide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The chat button is hidden
  from display on the webpage.

To include a `Chatbot`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on this
channel, select it from the drop-down menu. If the chatbot should only
be active when no operators are available, check the box labeled
`Enabled only
if no operator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If a
`chatbot </applications/websites/livechat/chatbots>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is added to a live chat channel, a new
`Chatbots`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button appears on
the channel settings form. Click here to create and update the chatbot
*script*.

Each line in the script contains a `Message`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Step Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Answers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and conditional *Only If*
logic that applies when certain pre-filled answers are chosen.

To create more steps in the script, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and fill out the script steps form, according to the
desired logic.
::::

Add the URLs for the pages where the channel should appear in the
`URL Regex`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Only the path from
the root domain is needed, not the full URL.

If this channel should only be available to users in specific countries,
add those countries to the `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. If this field is left blank, the channel is available to all site
visitors.

![View of the Kanban cards for the available Live Chat channels.](receiving_tickets/receiving-tickets-channel-rules.png)

##### Widget tab

The `Widget`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on the live chat
channel form offers a website widget that can be added to third-party
websites. Additionally, a URL is available, that can provide instant
access to a live chat window.

The live chat `Widget`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be applied
to websites created through Odoo by navigating to the
`Website app --> Configuration --> Settings --> Email & Marketing`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, scroll to the `Live Chat`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, and select the channel to add to the site. Click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to apply.

To add the widget to a website created on a third-party website, click
the `Copy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to the first
listed code, and paste the code into the [\<head\>]{.title-ref} tag on
the site.

To send a live chat session to a customer or supplier, click the
`Copy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to the second
listed code, and send the URL via email.

#### Create a support ticket from a live chat session

Operators who have joined a live chat channel are able to communicate
with site visitors in real-time.

During the conversation, an operator can use the shortcut `command
</applications/websites/livechat/responses>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} [/ticket]{.title-ref} to create a ticket without leaving the
chat window. The transcript from the conversation is added to the new
ticket, under the `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

**Helpdesk** tickets can also be created through the `WhatsApp
</applications/productivity/whatsapp>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} app
using the same [/ticket]{.title-ref} command.
::::

### Website Form {#helpdesk/receiving_tickets/website-form}

Enabling the *Website Form* setting adds a new page to the website with
a customizable form. A new ticket is created once the required form
fields are filled out and submitted.

To activate the website form, navigate to a team\'s settings page under
`Helpdesk app
--> Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and selecting the desired team from the list.

Then, locate the `Website Form`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
feature, under the `Help Center`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section, and check the box.

If more than one website is active on the database, confirm the correct
website is listed in the `Website`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. If not, select the correct one from the drop-down list.

After the feature is activated, click the
`Go to Website`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the
top of the `Teams`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} settings page to
view and edit the new website form, which is created automatically by
Odoo.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

After enabling the `Website Form`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
setting, the team\'s settings page may need to be refreshed before the
`Go to Website`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button appears.

Additionally, if a *Help Center* is published, the smart button
navigates there first. Simply click the `Contact Us`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, at the bottom of the forum, to navigate to the
ticket submission form.
::::

![View of the settings page of a helpdesk team emphasizing the Go to Website button in
Odoo Helpdesk.](receiving_tickets/receiving-tickets-go-to-website.png)

#### Website ticket form customization

To customize the default ticket submission form, while on the website,
click the `Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
upper-right corner of the page. This opens the editing sidebar on the
right side. Then, click on one of the fields in the form, on the body of
the website, to edit it.

To add a new field, go to the `Field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section of the sidebar, and click `+
Field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Click the `🗑️ (trash can)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to
delete the field, if necessary.

Edit the other options for the new field in the sidebar, as desired:

  to the field (e.g. [Customer Name]{.title-ref}).
- `Input Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: determine what type
  of input the field should be, like [Text]{.title-ref},
  [Email]{.title-ref}, [Telephone]{.title-ref}, or [URL]{.title-ref}.
- `Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: give the form field a
  label (e.g. [Full Name]{.title-ref}, [Email Address]{.title-ref},
  etc.). Also control the label position on the form by using the nested
  `Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options.
- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: determine whether or
  not to add an editable line under the input box to provide additional
  contextual information related to the field.
- `Placeholder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: add a sample input
  value.
- `Default Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: add common use
  case values that most customers would find valuable. For example, this
  can include prompts of information customers should include to make it
  easier to solve their issue, such as an account number, or product
  number.
- `Required`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: determine whether or
  not to mark a field as required, in order for the form to be
  submitted. Toggle the switch from gray to blue.
- `Visibility`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: allow for absolute or
  conditional visibility of the field. Nested options, such as, device
  visibility, appear when certain options are selected.
- `Animation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: choose whether or not
  the field should include animation.

![View of the unpublished website form to submit a ticket for Odoo Helpdesk.](receiving_tickets/receiving-tickets-web-form.png){.align-center}

Once the form has been optimized, and is ready for public use, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to apply the changes. Then,
publish the form by toggling the `Unpublished`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} switch to `Published`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} at the top of the page, if necessary.

## Prioritizing tickets

All tickets include a `Priority`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. The highest priority tickets appear at the top of the Kanban and
list views.

![View of a team\'s Kanban view and the prioritized tasks in Odoo Helpdesk.](receiving_tickets/receiving-tickets-priority.png)

The priority levels are represented by stars:

- 0 stars = *Low Priority*
- 1 star = *Medium Priority*
- 2 stars = *High Priority*
- 3 stars = *Urgent*

Tickets are set to low priority (0 stars) by default. To change the
priority level, select the appropriate number of stars on the Kanban
card, or on the ticket.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning

# Reporting

Reports in Odoo **Helpdesk** provide the opportunity to manage employee
workloads, identify areas for improvement, and confirm if customer
expectations are being met.

## Available reports

Details about the reports available in Odoo **Helpdesk** can be found
below. To view the different reports, go to
`Helpdesk app --> Reporting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and select one of the following: `Tickets Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `SLA Status Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Customer Ratings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

### Tickets Analysis

The *Tickets Analysis* report
(`Helpdesk app --> Reporting --> Tickets Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}) provides an overview of every customer support
ticket in the database.

This report is useful for identifying where teams are spending the most
time, and helps determine if there is an uneven workload distribution
among the support staff. The default report counts the number of tickets
per team and groups them by stage.

![View of Ticket Analysis report default view.](reports/tickets-default.png)

Alternative measures can be selected to track where the most time is
spent at different points in the workflow. To change the measures used
for the report that is currently displayed, or to add more, click the
`Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and select one or
more options from the drop-down menu:

- `Average Hours to Respond`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: average
  number of working hours between a message sent from the customer and
  the response from the support team. *This does not include messages
  sent when the ticket was in a folded stage.*
- `Hours Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: number of hours
  between the date the ticket was created and the closed date. If there
  is no closed date on the ticket, the current date is used. **This
  measure is not specific to working hours.**
- `Hours Spent (Timesheets)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: number
  of *Timesheet* hours logged on a ticket. *This measure is only
  available if Timesheets are enabled on a team, and the current user
  has the access rights to view them.*
- `Hours to First Response`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: number
  of working hours between the date the ticket was received and the date
  on which the first message was sent. *This does not include email sent
  automatically when a ticket reaches a stage.*
- `Rating (1-5)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: number out of five
  to represent customer feedback (Dissatisfied = 1, Okay/Neutral = 3,
  Satisfied = 5).
- `Remaining Hours on SO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: hours
  remaining on a linked sales order.
- `Working Hours to Assign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: number
  of working hours between the date the ticket was created and when it
  was assigned to a team member.
- `Working Hours to Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: number of
  working hours between the date the ticket was created and the date it
  was closed.
- `Working Hours until SLA Deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  number of working hours remaining to reach the last
  `SLA (Service Level Agreement)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  deadline on a ticket.
- `Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: number of tickets in
  total.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

*Working hours* are calculated based on the default working calendar. To
view or change the working calendar, go to the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} application and
select `Employees --> Company Working Hours`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

### SLA Status Analysis

The *SLA Status Analysis* report
(`Helpdesk app --> Reporting --> SLA Status
Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"})
`analyzes the performance <helpdesk/analyze-sla-performance>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} of individual SLA (Service Level Agreement) policies.

By default, this report is filtered to show the number of
`SLAs (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} failed,
in progress, and the number that have been successful. The results are
grouped by teams.

![View of Group by options of Ticket Analysis report.](reports/sla-status.png)

or to add more, click the `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button, and select one or more options from the drop-down menu:

- `Average Hours to Respond`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: average
  number of working hours between a message sent from the customer and
  the response from the support team. *This does not include messages
  sent when the ticket was in a folded stage.*
- `Hours Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: number of hours
  between the date the ticket was created and the closed date. If there
  is no closed date on the ticket, the current date is used. **This
  measure is not specific to working hours.**
- `Hours Spent (Timesheets)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: number
  of *Timesheet* hours logged on a ticket. *This measure is only
  available if Timesheets are enabled on a team, and the current user
  has the access rights to view them.*
- `Hours to First Response`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: number
  of working hours between the date the ticket was received and the date
  on which the first message was sent. *This does not include email sent
  automatically when a ticket reaches a stage.*
- `Number of SLA Failed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: number of
  tickets that have failed at least one
  `SLA (Service Level Agreement)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
- `Rating (1-5)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: number value
  representing customer feedback (Dissatisfied = 1, Okay/Neutral = 3,
  Satisfied = 5).
- `Remaining Hours on SO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: hours
  remaining on a linked sales order.
- `Working Hours to Assign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: number
  of working hours between the date the ticket was created and when it
  was assigned to a team member.
- `Working Hours to Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: number of
  working hours between the date the ticket was created and the date it
  was closed.
- `Working Hours to Reach SLA`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  number of working hours between the date the ticket was created and
  the date the `SLA (Service Level Agreement)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} was satisfied.
- `Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: number of tickets in
  total.

### Customer Ratings

The *Customer Ratings* report
(`Helpdesk app--> Reporting --> Customer Ratings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}) displays an overview of the ratings received on
individual support tickets, as well as any additional comments submitted
with the rating.

## Use cases

### Assessing performance based on customer priority

The `Tickets Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report can be
used to evaluate the time it takes to address high-priority tickets
compared to standard ones. This helps ensure that high-priority tickets
are resolved promptly, and identifies any discrepancies in response
times based on priority.

First, navigate to
`Helpdesk app --> Reporting --> Tickets Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click `Measures`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, then select `Working Hours to Close`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Click into the search bar, then under
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select
`Priority`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Finally, under
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select
`Closed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The pivot view is also useful for this version of the report.
::::

### Monitoring SLA compliance over time

The `SLA Status Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report can
be used to track `SLA (Service Level Agreement)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} compliance trends to identify periods with higher
`SLA (Service Level Agreement)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} breaches.
`SLA (Service Level Agreement)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} breaches
happen when support teams fail to meet the response or resolution times
promised in `SLAs (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, leading to dissatisfied customers, potential financial
penalties, and decreased team morale. Identifying these breaches is
crucial for tracking real-time performance, uncovering patterns, and
addressing root causes---like staffing issues or process inefficiencies.

First, navigate to
`Helpdesk app --> Reporting --> SLA Status Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click the `fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Graph)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, then the
`fa-line-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Line
Chart)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

While the `SLA Status Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
report defaults to the pivot view, the line chart view provides a better
visual representation for this specific use case.
::::

Click `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then select
`Number of SLAs Failed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so
ensures the data on the report shows **only** information for tickets
that failed at least one
`SLA (Service Level Agreement)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Click
into the search bar, then under `Group By`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, select `SLA Deadline`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and select a time frame, either
`Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Week`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This
option shows when the highest number of tickets with
`SLAs (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are
failing, allowing the team to identify patterns, and prepare for
potential issues.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The time frame selected for this report may vary depending on a few
factors, including the amount of tickets received on a regular basis,
the number of `SLAs (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} enabled in the database, and the workload of the team. It
is worth experimenting to see what option delivers the most insights.

# Service level agreements (SLA)

A *service level agreement* (SLA) defines the level of support a
customer can expect from a service provider.
`SLAs (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} provide
a timeline that tells customers when they can expect results and keeps
the support team on target.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The *SLA Policies* feature is enabled by default on newly created
**Helpdesk** teams.

To turn off the feature, or edit the working hours, navigate to
`Helpdesk app -->
Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click on a team to open that team\'s
configuration page.

From here, scroll to the `Performance`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section. To turn off the
`SLAs (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} feature
for the team, clear the `SLA Policies`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox.

![View of a team page in Helpdesk focusing on the SLA Policies setting.](sla/sla-enable.png)
::::

## Create a new SLA policy

To create a new policy, go to
`Helpdesk app --> Configuration --> SLA Policies`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Alternatively, go to
`Helpdesk app --> Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click on a team. Then, click the
`SLA Policies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the
top of the team\'s settings page, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

On the blank `SLA (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} policy form, enter a `Title`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and a `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
for the new policy, and proceed to fill out the form using the steps
below.

### Define the criteria for an SLA policy

The `Criteria`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section is used to
identify which tickets this policy is applied to.

Fill out the following fields to adjust the selection criteria:

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Unless otherwise indicated, multiple selections can be made for each
field.
::::

- `Helpdesk Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A policy can only
  be applied to one team. *This field is required.*
- `Priority`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The priority level for
  a ticket is identified by selecting one, two, or three of the
  `fa-star-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(star)`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} icons, representing the priority level on the Kanban
  card or on the ticket itself. The
  `SLA (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
  **only** applied after the priority level has been updated on the
  ticket to match the `SLA (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} criteria. If no selection is made in this field, this
  policy only applies to tickets marked as [Low Priority]{.title-ref},
  meaning those with zero `fa-star-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(star)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icons.
- `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tags are used to indicate
  what the ticket is about. Multiple tags can be applied to a single
  ticket.
- `Customers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Individual contacts or
  companies may be selected in this field.
- `Services`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field is available
  only if a team has the **Timesheets** app enabled. This allows the
  ticket to link directly to a specific line on a sales order, which
  must be indicated on the ticket in the
  `Sales Order Items`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

::: example
A support team needs to address urgent issues for VIP customers within
one business day.

The new policy, titled [8 Hours to close]{.title-ref}, is assigned to
the [VIP Support]{.title-ref} team. It **only** applies to tickets that
are assigned three `fa-star-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(star)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icons, which equates to an
[Urgent]{.title-ref} priority level.

At the same time, the tickets can be related to multiple issues, so the
policy applies to tickets with [Repair]{.title-ref},
[Service]{.title-ref}, or [Emergency]{.title-ref} tags.

![View of a new SLA policy record with all the relevant information entered.](sla/sla-create-new.png)
:::

### Establish a target for an SLA policy

A *target* is the stage a ticket needs to reach, and the time allotted
to reach that stage, in order to satisfy the
`SLA (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} policy.
Any stage assigned to a team may be selected for the `Reach
Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Time spent in stages selected in the
`Excluding Stages`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field are **not**
included in the calculation of the
`SLA (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
deadline.

::: example
An `SLA (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
titled [8 Hours to Close]{.title-ref} tracks the working time before a
ticket is completed, and would have [Solved]{.title-ref} as the
`Reach Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Simultaneously, an
`SLA (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} titled
[2 Days to Start]{.title-ref} tracks the working time before work on a
ticket has begun, and would have [In Progress]{.title-ref} as the
`Reach Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
:::

## Meet SLA deadlines

As soon as it is determined that a ticket fits the criteria of an
`SLA (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} policy,
a deadline is calculated. The deadline is based on the creation date of
the ticket, as well as the targeted working hours.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The value indicated next to the `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field of an
`SLA (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} policy
is used to determine the deadline. By default, this is determined by the
value set in the `Company
Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field under
`Settings app --> Employees --> Work Organization`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

The deadline is then added to the ticket, as well as a tag indicating
the name of the `SLAs (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} applied.

![View of a ticket\'s form emphasizing an open SLA deadline on a ticket in Odoo Helpdesk.](sla/sla-open-deadline.png)

When a ticket satisfies an
`SLA (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} policy,
the `SLA (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} tag
turns green, and the deadline disappears from view on the ticket.

![View of a ticket\'s form emphasizing a satisfied SLA in Odoo Helpdesk.](sla/sla-deadline.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If a ticket fits the criteria for more than one
`SLA (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
earliest occurring deadline is displayed on the ticket. After that
deadline has passed, the next deadline is displayed.
::::

If the `SLA (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
deadline passes and the ticket has not moved to the
`Reach Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`SLA (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} tag
turns red. After the `SLA (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} has failed, the red tag stays on the ticket, even after the
ticket is moved to the `Reach Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![View of a ticket\'s form with a failing and passing SLA in Odoo Helpdesk.](sla/sla-passing-failing.png)

## Analyze SLA performance {#helpdesk/analyze-sla-performance}

The `SLA Status Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report
tracks how quickly an `SLA (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is fulfilled, as well as the performance of individual team
members. Navigate to the report, and corresponding pivot table, by going
to
`Helpdesk app --> Reporting --> SLA Status Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

### Pivot view

By default, the report displays in a `Pivot`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} view. Any
`SLA (Service Level Agreements)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} policies
in the database with tickets that failed to fulfill a policy, are in
progress, or have satisfied a policy are listed. By default, they are
grouped by team and ticket count.

![The pivot view aggregates data, which can be manipulated by adding
measures and
filters.](sla/sla-status-analysis.png){alt="View of the SLA status analysis report in Odoo Helpdesk."}

To change the display, or add additional measurements, click the
`Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to reveal a
drop-down menu of reporting criteria, and choose from the options
available.

Whenever a measurement is picked, a `fa-check`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(check)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon appears
in the drop-down menu to indicate that the measurement is included, and
a corresponding new column emerges in the pivot table to show the
relevant calculations.

![View of the available measures in the SLA status analysis report.](sla/sla-pivot-measures.png)

To add a group to a row or column, click the
`fa-plus-square`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(plus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon next to the policy name
and then select one of the groups. To remove one, click the
`fa-minus-square-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(minus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon next to the policy
name.

![View of the available group by options in the SLA status analysis report.](sla/sla-pivot-groups.png)

### Graph view

Switch to the graph view by selecting the
`fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(graph view)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon at the top of the
screen. To switch between the different charts, select the *related
icon* at the top of the chart, while in graph view.

instead of next to each other, making it easier to compare data. While
viewing either a bar chart or line chart, click the
`fa-database`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}

# Helpdesk

Odoo **Helpdesk** is a ticket-based customer support application.
Multiple teams can be configured and managed in one dashboard, each with
their own pipeline for tickets submitted by customers. Pipelines are
organized in customizable stages that enable teams to track, prioritize,
and solve customer issues quickly and efficiently.

## Create a Helpdesk team {#helpdesk/create-team}

To view or modify **Helpdesk** teams, go to
`Helpdesk app --> Configuration -->
Helpdesk Teams`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. To create a new
team, click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
top-left of the dashboard.

![View of the Helpdesk teams page in Odoo Helpdesk.](helpdesk/helpdesk-teams-list.png)

On the blank Helpdesk team form, enter a `Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for the new team. Then, enter a description of the team
in the field below the team name, if desired. To change the company this
team is assigned to, select it from the `Company`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The team description is published on the public facing `website form
<helpdesk/overview/receiving_tickets>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"},
where customers and portal users submit tickets. The description
included in this field should **not** include any information that is
for internal use only.

![View of a Helpdesk team\'s website form displaying the team description.](helpdesk/team-description-webform.png)
::::

### Visibility & Assignment

The *Visibility* settings alter which internal users and portal users
have access to this team and its tickets. The *Assignment* settings
alter how users are assigned to handle each ticket.

#### Determine team visibility

Under the `Visibility`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
select one of the following options to determine who can view this team
and its tickets:

- `Invited internal users (private)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  Internal users can access the team and the tickets they are following.
  This access can be modified on each ticket individually by adding or
  removing the user as a follower. Internal users are considered
  *invited* once they are added as followers to an individual ticket, or
  `to the team itself <helpdesk/follow>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
- `All internal users (company)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: All
  internal users can access the team and all of its tickets.
- `Invited portal users and all internal users (public)`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: All internal users can access the team and all of
  its tickets. Portal users can only access the tickets they are
  following.

::: example
A [Customer Support]{.title-ref} team, meant to handle general shipping
and product issues, would have the visibility set on
`Invited portal users and all internal users`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

At the same time, a [Financial Services]{.title-ref} team handling
tickets related to accounting or tax information would only need to be
visible to `Invited internal users`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
:::

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

A team\'s visibility can be altered after the initial configuration.
However, if the team changes from *Invited portal users and all internal
users (public)* access to either *Invited internal users (private)* or
*All internal users (company)*-only access, portal users are removed as
followers from both the team, and from individual tickets.
::::

#### Follow all team\'s tickets {#helpdesk/follow}

If a user should be notified about any updates regarding tickets for
this team, select their name from the `Followers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu, located in the
`Follow All Team's Tickets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
Multiple users can be selected to follow a single team.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

External contacts can be selected in the `Followers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. If the team\'s visibility is set to
`Invited internal users (private)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
followers are notified about updates to the team\'s tickets, but are
**not** able to view them in the portal.
::::

#### Automatically assign new tickets

When tickets are received, they need to be assigned to a member of the
team. This is done either manually on each individual ticket, or through
`Automatic Assignment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Check the
`Automatic Assignment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox to
enable this feature for the team.

![View of a Helpdesk team settings page emphasizing the automatic assignment features in Odoo
Helpdesk.](helpdesk/helpdesk-visibility-assignment.png)

Select one of the following assignment methods, based on how the
workload should be allocated across the team:

- `Each user is assigned an equal number of tickets`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: Tickets are assigned to team members based on total
  ticket count, regardless of the number of open or closed tickets they
  are currently assigned.
- `Each user has an equal number of open tickets`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: Tickets are assigned to team members based on how
  many open tickets they are currently assigned.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When
`Each user is assigned an equal number of tickets`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is selected, the overall number of tickets assigned to
team members is the same, but it does **not** consider the current
workload.

When `Each user has an equal number of open tickets`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is selected, it ensures a balanced workload among team
members, as it takes the current number of active tickets into account.
::::

Finally, add the `Team Members`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} who
are to be assigned tickets for this team. Leave the field empty to
include all employees who have the proper assignments and access rights
configured in their user account settings.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If an employee has time off scheduled in the **Time Off** application,
they are **not** assigned tickets during that time. If no employees are
available, the system looks ahead until there is a match.
::::

::: seealso
\- `Manage users <users/add-individual>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} -
`Access rights <../general/users/access_rights>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Merge tickets

If duplicate tickets are found in **Helpdesk**, they can be combined
into a single ticket using the *merge* feature.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The *merge* feature is **only** accessible if the `Data Cleaning
<../productivity/data_cleaning>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
application is installed on the database.
::::

To merge two or more tickets, navigate to
`Helpdesk app --> Tickets --> All Tickets`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Identify the tickets to be merged, and tick the
checkbox at the far-left of each ticket to select them. Then, click the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon, and select `Merge`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu. Doing so opens a new page
where the selected tickets are listed with their
`Similarity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} rating. From here, click
either `Merge <data_cleaning/merge-records>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to combine the tickets, or `DISCARD`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

## Convert tickets to opportunities

Some tickets may be better handled by the sales team, rather than the
support team. In this case, tickets can be converted to *opportunities*
and assigned to a sales team for follow-up.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

This feature is **only** available if the
`CRM <../sales/crm>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} app is installed.
::::

To convert a ticket to an opportunity, first navigate to a ticket,
either from a team\'s pipeline, or by navigating to
`Helpdesk app --> Tickets`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
clicking a ticket to open it.

At the top of the ticket, click the
`Convert to Opportunity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If `leads <../sales/crm/acquire_leads/convert>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} are enabled on the **CRM** app, tickets are converted to
*leads*, and the button reads `Convert to Lead`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

This opens the `Convert to Opportunity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up. Fill in or select the following information on
the pop-up:

- `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select whether to
  `Create a new customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Link to an
  existing customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Do not link to a customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If
  `Link to a customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is chosen,
  select the appropriate customer name from the
  `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down.
- `Sales Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Specify which
  `Sales Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Salesperson`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} this created
  opportunity is assigned to.

![The convert to opportunity pop-up window.](helpdesk/convert-to-opp.png)

After completing the form, click
`Convert to Opportunity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so
creates a new opportunity in the **CRM** app. The original ticket is
linked in the chatter of the new opportunity for traceability.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

After the ticket is converted to an opportunity, the ticket is archived.

# Planning

**Odoo Planning** allows you to plan your team\'s schedule and manage
shifts and resources.

Handling your team\'s planning comes with specific requirements that may
vary widely depending on your business needs. The following concepts
were introduced in Odoo Planning to meet those needs:

**Shifts** are dispatched to **resources**, which can be either
`human <planning/employees>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} (employees)
or `material <planning/materials>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} (e.g.,
equipment). The resources are assigned
`roles <planning/roles>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, which allows for
organization of work within the team.

Once the initial configuration is done,
`planning shifts <planning/shifts>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} can be
done manually or automated by using the
`Auto Plan <planning/open-shifts>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
feature.

An integration between the Planning and Sales apps allows the linking of
sold services to roles and shifts in Planning. Additionally, integration
with `Project <project>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} allows dedicating
shifts, and thus time and resources, to specific projects.

::: seealso
[Odoo tutorials: Planning](https://www.odoo.com/slides/planning-60)
:::

## Configuration {#planning/configuration}

### Roles {#planning/roles}

To define the roles your resources perform (e.g., chef, bartender,
waiter), go to `Planning --> Configuration --> Roles`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and fill in the `Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} (e.g., assistant, receptionist, manager). Then, choose
the `Resources`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that will perform
this role. Resources can be either
`Employees <planning/employees>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or
`Materials <planning/materials>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- If the Sales app is installed in your database, the
`Services`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears, allowing
you to specify which roles are needed to perform services so that the
shifts are dispatched to the right person. - Roles are taken into
account when using the
`Auto Plan feature <planning/open-shifts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

#### Property fields and roles

**Property fields** allow you to add custom fields to forms across
several Odoo applications. Planning includes the possibility of adding
property fields linked to roles to shifts.

To create a property field, switch to the list view from any schedule.
From there, click `View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the shift
that you wish to edit. If the `Role`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field is empty, fill it in with the desired role, then click the cog
icon and select `Add Properties`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
`Configure </applications/essentials/property_fields>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} the new field according to your needs.

![Creating a new property field in Planning.](planning/add-properties.png)

The property field is linked to the role and is included in the shift
form of all shifts performed by this role.

::: example
Some of the use cases of role property fields include:

- **Accreditation**: for roles that require a specific permit (e.g.,
  driving license)
- **Location**: in companies that operate in multiple locations (e.g.,
  shops or restaurants)
- **Language**: in a multi-lingual environment (e.g., consulting
  company)
:::

### Employees {#planning/employees}

All employees can be included in the planning and assigned shifts.

To adapt the employee\'s planning settings, go to
`Planning --> Configuration -->
Employees`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and choose the
employee for whom you want to edit the settings. Then, go to the
`Work Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![Employee profile and the work information tab.](planning/employee-tab.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can do the same from the **Employees** app, which is installed by
default along with Planning.
::::

Two sections of the employee\'s `Work Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab have an impact on Planning:
`Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (namely, the
`Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field) and
`Planning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

#### Working hours {#planning/working-hours}

The `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are taken into
account when the `Allocated Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
its percentage is calculated for
`shifts <planning/templates>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. If the
`Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is left blank,
the employee is considered to be working flexible hours.

To create individual `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
for example, for employees working part-time, click
`Search more...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
`Allocated Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in Planning can
impact **Payroll**, if the employee\'s contract is configured to
generate work entries based on shifts.
::::

::: seealso
`../hr/payroll/working_schedules`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

#### Planning roles

Once an employee has one or more `Roles`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}:

- When creating a shift for this employee, only the shift templates from
  the roles chosen in this field are displayed.
- When a schedule is published, the employee is only notified of open
  shifts for the roles that are assigned to them.
- When auto-assigning open shifts or planning sales orders, the employee
  is only assigned shifts for the roles assigned to them.

Additionally, when a `Default role`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
is defined:

- When creating a shift for the employee, the default role is
  automatically selected.
- This role also has precedence over the other roles of the employee
  when auto-assigning open shifts or planning sales orders.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the Planning roles fields are left empty, there are no restrictions
in the shift templates and open shifts shared with the employee.
However, it's not possible to use the **Auto Plan** feature for employee
with no roles.
::::

### Materials {#planning/materials}

**Materials** are resources that can be assigned shifts and working
hours but are not employees. For example, a construction company could
use materials to create shifts for shared machines (e.g., cranes,
forklifts).

Similarly to employees, materials can be assigned roles and working
time.

### Shift templates {#planning/templates}

To create a shift template, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on any schedule, then fill in the
`details of the shift <planning/create-shift>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. In order for the shift to be saved as a template, click
`Save Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Shift form.](planning/save-template.png)

Alternatively, you can go to
`Planning --> Configuration --> Shift Templates`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Fill in the `Start Hour`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Span`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
shift's `End Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is then calculated
based on the `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, taking
into account working time as well as breaks.

::: example
The employee\'s working hours are Monday to Friday, 8 am to 5 pm, with a
break between 12 and 1 pm.

- Creating a shift template with a start hour of 9 am and a duration of
  8 hours will result in the end hour being 5 pm, based on the working
  hours and the 1-hour break.
- Creating a shift template with a start hour of 10 am and a duration of
  10 hours will result in the end hour of 10 am the following day, as
  the company is closed at 5 pm according to the working hours.
:::

Additionally, for each shift template, you can also configure:

- `Role`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to link the shift to this
  specific role.
- `Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to keep track of shifts
  that are dedicated to work on a project.

## Planning shifts {#planning/shifts}

On opening the Planning app, the users see their own schedule. Users
with admin roles can also see `Schedule by Resource`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Role`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Sales Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, as well as reporting
and configuration menus.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The schedule is displayed in the Gantt view, which allows you to edit
(with a drag and drop), resize, split, and duplicate shifts without
having to open them.
::::

![A schedule displaying various visual elements.](planning/schedule.png)

The following visual elements are used on the shifts in the schedules:

- **Full color**: shifts that are planned and published.
- **Diagonal stripes**: shifts that are planned but have yet to be
  published.
- **Grayed-out background**: employees that are on time off.
- **Progress bar**: currently ongoing shifts with timesheets linked to
  them.
- **Grayed-out shift**: when copying shifts, the copied shifts are shown
  in full color, whereas previously existing shifts are temporarily
  greyed out. The color changes back to full color or diagonal stripes
  on the next refresh of the page or by removing the filter.

### Create a shift {#planning/create-shift}

To create a shift, go to any schedule, then click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In the pop-up window that
opens, fill in the following details:

- **Templates**: If there is one or more templates existing in your
  database, they are displayed in the upper section of the pop-up
  window. Once selected, a template prefills the shift form accordingly.
- `Resource`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Resources can be both
  employees or materials. If this field is left empty, the shift is
  considered an `open shift <planning/open-shifts>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- `Role`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the role that the
  resource assigned will be performing. This field is used when
  `auto-planning <planning/open-shifts>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  shifts. Once you select a role, the shift templates associated with it
  are displayed in the upper section of the pop-up window.
- `Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the Project app is
  installed in your database, this field allows you to link the project
  to the shift is available, allowing you to plan and track shifts
  dedicated to work on the selected project.
- `Sales Order Item`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the Sales
  app is installed in your database, this field allows you to link a
  sales order to the shift.
- `Repeat`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Click the
  `fa-repeat`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(repeat)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and configure the
  `Repeat every`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields according to
  your needs. The following rules apply to recurring shifts:
  - All fields (e.g., `Resource`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Role`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) are copied from the
    original shift except for the date, which is adjusted according to
    the `Repeat Every`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
  - Recurrences are planned but not published.
  - By default, planned shifts are created six months in advance, after
    which they are created gradually. To change the time frame,
    `activate the Developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, then go to
    `Planning --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and edit the
    `Recurring Shifts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Additional note sent to the employee`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: Click on the field to add a note.
- `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Choose the date and time of
  your shift. This is the only mandatory field when creating a shift.
- `Allocated time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Is calculated
  based on the date and the employee's `Working
  Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. See more in
  `Shift Templates <planning/templates>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Click `Publish & Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the
shift and send the assigned employee their schedule by email.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The draft is visible on the admin planning view and can be identified by
diagonal lines. The employee is only notified of the shift once it\'s
published.

Two kinds of notifications are sent to the employees depending on their
account configuration:

- Employees without user accounts are redirected to a dedicated
  **Planning portal**.
- Employees with a user account are redirected to the
  `My Planning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view in the backend
  view of Odoo.
::::

:::: tip

Tip
:::

The **split shifts** tool allows to easily split a long shift into
segments. To do so, hover the mouse over the desired shift and click the
`fa-scissors`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
(`scissors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) icon.

![Split shifts tool.](planning/split-shifts.png)
::::

### Open shifts and auto planning {#planning/open-shifts}

The `Auto Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button allows you to
assign **Open shifts** (shifts with no resource assigned) and create and
assign shifts linked to sales orders or project.

The following features have an impact on auto planning:

- **Roles**: Open shifts are only assigned to resources (employees or
  materials) that have the corresponding role assigned. It is not
  possible to use the `Auto Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  feature for employee with no roles.
- **Default roles**: The default role assigned to a resource is given
  priority over the other roles they have assigned to them.
- **Conflicts**: Employees or materials cannot be assigned multiple
  shifts at the same time.
- **Time off**: The employees' time off is taken into account, as well
  as public holidays.
- **Working hours**: Are taken into account when assigning shifts to
  employees or materials. It is not possible to use the
  `Auto Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature for an employee
  who is working
  `flexible hours <planning/working-hours>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- **Contracts**: If the employee has an active contract, they won\'t be
  assigned shifts that fall outside of their contract period.

Click `Publish`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the
schedule and notify the employees of their planning.

### Switching shifts and unassignment {#planning/switching-unassignment}

Two features are available to allow employees to make changes to their
schedule: **switching shifts** and **unassignment**.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

These features are mutually exclusive. Switching shifts is possible by
default and cannot be disabled. However, once the **Allow unassignment**
feature is enabled, it replaces the option to switch shifts.
::::

#### Switching shifts

Once shifts are planned and published, employees receive an email
notification. If an employee wishes to switch a shift, they can click
the unwanted shift and click `Ask to switch`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

The shift remains assigned to the original employee, but in the
schedule, a notification informing that the assigned employee would like
to switch shifts is visible on the shift.

The shift is then displayed to other employees who share the same role,
and if they wish to assign it to themselves, they can click the
`I take it`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The following rules apply:

- Only the shifts matching the employee\'s roles are displayed as
  available to them.
- Switching shifts is not available for shifts in the past.
::::

#### Unassignment

To allow employees to unassign themselves from shifts, go to
`Planning --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then tick the checkbox
`Allow Unassignment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, specify
the maximum number of days that the employees can unassign themselves
before the shift.

Once shifts are planned and published, employees receive an email
notification. If shift unassignment is allowed, the employees can click
the `I am unavailable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and
the shift reverts to an open shift.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The following rules apply:

- Only the shifts matching the employee\'s roles are displayed in their
  schedule.
- Unassigning shifts is not available for shifts in the past.

# Project dashboard

The project dashboard allows you to get a comprehensive overview of your
project\'s status. It displays information such as the total number of
tasks, timesheets, and planned hours linked to the project, as well as
detailed information about project milestones and its costs and
revenues. Within the project dashboard, you can create
`Project updates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which allow you to
take a snapshot of the project\'s status at a certain point in time. As
such, it is a crucial tool for effective project management and ensuring
that your project stays on track.

# Project profitability

When handling billable projects, it is essential to determine whether
your projects are turning a profit. Measuring **project profitability**
involves keeping track of the costs of resources used to carry out the
project, such as employee costs, materials used, purchases, expenses, or
after-sales services, and comparing them with the project revenues.

Project profitability is tracked in the
`project dashboard <project_dashboard>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} on
all billable projects.

To access the `project dashboard <project_dashboard>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, open the **Project** app and navigate to the applicable
project. Click the `fa-sliders`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
(`sliders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) icon to add
`Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the project\'s
`top bar <project/project-management/top-bar>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

:::: tip

You can also access the
`project dashboard <project_dashboard>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} by
hovering over the desired project's card, clicking the
`fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
(`vertical ellipsis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), and selecting
`Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

The **profitability dashboard** is on the right side of the project
dashboard and displays data for all records linked to the project and
its
`analytic account </applications/finance/accounting/reporting/analytic_accounting>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. It's divided into two major sections:
`revenues <project/project-profitability/revenues>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, which displays a breakdown of income generated by the
project, and
`costs <project/project-profitability/costs>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} accrued by your company. The same record can be displayed in
both sections, e.g., the same timesheet is listed under
`Revenues`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with the amount the
customer paid for the work and under `Costs`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} with the amount of wages paid to the employees.

![Project dashboard.](project_profitability/profitability-dashboard.png)

The amounts displayed in the profitability report are divided into three
columns:

> - `Expected`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the amounts expected
>   based on existing sales or purchase orders.
> - `To invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (revenues) or
>   `To bill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (costs): the amounts
>   are moved to this column when the work or goods have been delivered,
>   e.g., a
>   `timesheet </applications/services/timesheets>`{.interpreted-text
>   role="doc"} has been created and/or validated, a delivery order has
>   been marked as done, or the delivered quantity has been manually
>   updated on the sales order.
> - `Invoiced`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
>   `Billed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the amounts are moved
>   to this column once an invoice or bill has been confirmed.

Based on the same principle, the revenues section is further divided
into `Sold`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Delivered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Invoiced`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns. Use the
`fa-caret-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
(`arrow`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) icon to see a detailed
breakdown for each line.

# Project management

Odoo Project uses the **Kanban** project management system. This means
all projects are broken down into tasks, which are categorized on a
whiteboard according to what production phase they are in.

::: admonition
Did you know?

The word **Kanban** comes from Japanese and refers to the \"visual
board\" management method.
:::

## Configuration {#project_management/configuration}

Open the **Project** app and click `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to start a new project. Enter a
`Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for your project and click
`Create Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

You can customize your existing **projects** from the dashboard by
clicking the drop-down toggle button (`⋮`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}) on your project\'s **card**.

![Project card](project_management/project-settings.png){.align-center}

This enables a new menu divided into four parts:

- `View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: see an overview of your
  project\'s components, such as its `Tasks`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Milestones`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Project Updates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Depending on
  which apps you have activated, more options may be available, such as
  `Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. All uploaded files can
  be found under this menu, as well as in the **Documents** app, under
  `Projects`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
- `Reporting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: analyze your
  project\'s progress and profitability through graphics and statistics;
- **Color**: make a line of color appear on the left side of the card so
  that your project is more recognizable;
- `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: you can change the
  following:
  - the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the project;
  - the `Name of the tasks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} found
    under that project;
  - the `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for whom the
    project is intended;
  - the `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} used for filtering;
  - the `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} responsible for the
    project;
  - the employee designated as `Project Manager`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"};
  - the `Planned Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the
    project;
  - the total `Allocated Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
    that project.

Additionally, you can mark the project as `Favorite`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, allowing you to find it using the
`My Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter on the Kanban
view;

![Project settings](project_management/project-settings-opened.png){.align-center}

::: seealso
[Odoo Tutorials: Customize
projects](https://www.odoo.com/slides/slide/customize-projects-3615?fullscreen=1)
:::

Further settings are available under the `Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. Most of them are *only* available depending on the
activated apps.

### Visibility and collaboration

Odoo allows you to set visibility settings for each project, enabling
you to make your project available to everyone in your organization or
restrict access to certain internal or external users.

To do so, go to the project\'s `Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab and choose the desired
`Visibility`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option:

- `Invited internal users (private)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  Only users following the project and users with the Project
  Administrator
  `access right </applications/general/users/access_rights>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} can access the project and its tasks.
- `All internal users`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: All internal
  users can access the project and all of its tasks.
- `Invited portal users and all internal users (public)`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: All internal users can access the project and all of
  its tasks. When following a project, `portal users
  </applications/general/users/portal>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
  only have access to the specific tasks they are following. This option
  is selected by default.

### Inviting external users

To invite external users, make sure that
`Invited portal users and all internal users
(public)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, then click
`Share Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the
project's settings. The following options are available:

- Copy and share the `Public Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  displayed at the top of the pop-up window. Anyone with this link can
  access the project in read mode.

- Or click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select a
  `Collaborator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, choose the
  `Access Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and check the box to
  send an invitation to their email address.

  There are three types of `Access Mode`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} for collaborators:

  - `Read`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Collaborators can view
    tasks but cannot edit them.
  - `Edit with limited access`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    Collaborators can view and edit the tasks they follow.
  - `Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Collaborators can view
    and edit all tasks.

To revoke an invited collaborator\'s access, click
`Share Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the
project's settings, then click the `fa-trash-o`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(trash)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Internal users without access to the project can still access a task if
the URL has been shared with them. For projects set as
`Invited internal users (private)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
they must also be a follower of the task.
::::

## Scheduling activities

You can schedule **activities** (ex. `Call`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Meeting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, etc.)
per project by clicking on the **clock** icon on a project. Doing so
opens a list with already scheduled activities and allows planning
**new** activities by clicking
`+ Schedule an activity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. On the
pop-up window, select the `Activity Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, enter a `Summary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
for that activity, a `Due Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
assign it to an employee. According to the
`Activity Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, you may have
**additional options** available.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If an activity is **already** scheduled, the icon may change to a
**phone**, **group of people**, or other.
::::

## Top bar {#project/project-management/top-bar}

In project management, reviewing the various records and documents
related to a project is often necessary. Odoo Project's **top bar**
provides quick access to these essential resources. You can customize
each project\'s top bar to match its specific needs.

To set up the top bar for a project, go to the
`Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app, click the project\'s
card, then click the top bar `fa-sliders`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(sliders)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. In the bar that
appears above the search bar, click the `fa-sliders`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(sliders)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
select the records you want to display, such as timesheets, sales
orders, invoices, documents, dashboards, etc.

You can then click the buttons to access the related records without
leaving the Project app. To return to your project tasks\' Kanban view,
click the `Tasks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the top
bar.

![Top bar selection menu](project_management/top-bar.png)

### Custom top bar buttons

You can also create your own buttons to access more specific views:

1.  Click an existing top bar button to access the view.
2.  Customize the view with keywords, filters, and grouping options
    using the search bar.
3.  Click the `fa-sliders`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    `(sliders)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the top bar
    and select `Save View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
4.  Edit the default button name if necessary, then enable
    `Shared`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if you want to share the
    button with other users.

# Recurring tasks

When handling a project, the same task often needs to be performed
several times: for example, weekly meetings or status reports. The
**recurring tasks** feature allows you to automate the creation of those
tasks.

::: seealso
[Odoo Tutorials: Recurring
tasks](https://www.odoo.com/slides/slide/recurring-tasks-6958)
:::

## Configuration

To enable recurring tasks, go to
`Project --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then activate `Recurring Tasks`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and press `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Set up task recurrence

In an existing task, click the `fa-repeat`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} (`Recurrent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) button
next to the `Deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Then,
configure the `Repeat Every`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
according to your needs.

A new task in recurrence will be created once the status of the previous
task is set to `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Canceled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The new task is created on the project dashboard with the following
configuration:

- `Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: is set to the first stage
  of the project dashboard (`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  equivalent);
- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Assignees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: are copied from the
  original task;
- `Deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: is updated based on the
  `Repeat Every`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field (e.g., if the
  task is set to repeat once a week, 7 days will be added to the
  deadline);
- `Milestones`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Chatter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Activities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Subtasks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: are **not** copied from
  the original task.

Once a recurrence is configured, a **smart button** on the task displays
the total number of existing recurrences.

### Edit or stop task recurrence

**To edit** the recurrence, open the last task in recurrence. Any
changes made on the task will be applied to the tasks that will be
created in the future.

**To stop** the recurrence, open the last task in recurrence and press
the `Recurrent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to the
`Planned date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.




--- SOURCE: services/project/tasks/sub-tasks.md ---

# Sub-tasks

When handling project tasks, you can often benefit from splitting the
workload into smaller **sub-tasks**, making it easier to track progress
and manage the work.

Odoo's sub-task feature is particularly useful in some of the following
cases:

- The task workload is too big to handle in one record.
- There's a clear sequence of steps to follow.
- Some parts of the workload fall under the scope of different projects
  and/or assignees.

The original task to which sub-tasks are linked is referred to as the
**parent task**. The sub-tasks of the parent task are known as **child
tasks**.

## Creating sub-tasks

To create a sub-task:

1.  Open the Project app, then go into your desired project.
2.  Click the task where you want to add the sub-task, then click the
    `Sub-tasks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
3.  Click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then fill in
    the `Title`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
4.  Click the `fa-cloud-upload`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    (`save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) icon to save the task
    manually.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can edit several fields of a sub-task directly from the parent
task's sub-task tab without opening the individual sub-task. By default,
those are: `Title`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Priority`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Assignees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Use the
`fa-sliders`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} (`sliders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}) icon to add or remove fields.
::::

Once the new sub-task is created, the following changes occur in the
parent task:

- A **smart button** displays the total number of sub-tasks, as well as
  the number of closed (**done** or **canceled**) sub-tasks. Click the
  smart button to access the list of the sub-tasks.
- The `Allocated time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} displays the
  amount of time allocated to the parent task, as well as time allocated
  to the sub-tasks. This can be used to ensure that the time allocated
  to sub-tasks does not exceed time allocated to the parent task.
- The `Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab includes a
  breakdown of time spent on the parent task as well as sub-tasks.

Click `View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open the sub-task you
created. The sub-task form is identical to the
`task form <task_creation/task-configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

- A **smart button** allows to navigate back to the
  `Parent task`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- The `Sub-tasks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab allows for
  further creation of sub-tasks.
- Selecting a `Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} will trigger
  this sub-task to be displayed in the Kanban view of the selected
  project.

# Task creation

Tasks in Odoo Project can be created manually or automatically,
including from emails or website forms.

## Manual task creation

Open the Project app and choose the desired project. Create a new task
by doing one of the following:

> - Clicking the `fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
>   (`plus`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) button in the upper left
>   corner. This creates a new task in the first stage of your Kanban
>   view.
> - Pressing the `fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
>   (`plus`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) button next to the
>   Kanban stage name. This creates a new task in this Kanban stage.

Fill in the `Task Title`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and add one
or more `Assignees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then click
`Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Task configuration {#task_creation/task-configuration}

Click the task to open it. The task form includes the following fields
that you can fill in:

> - `Task Title`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: title of the task.
> - `fa-star-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} (`Star`{.interpreted-text
>   role="guilabel"}): click the `fa-star-o`{.interpreted-text
>   role="icon"} (`star`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) icon to
>   mark the task as high priority. The icon will turn yellow. Click it
>   again to remove the high priority.
> - `Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the project that this
>   task belongs to.
> - `Assignees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the person(s) in
>   charge of handling the work on this task.
> - `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: custom labels allowing to
>   categorize and filter your tasks.
> - `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the person or company
>   that will be billed for this task. This field only appears in tasks
>   that belong to billable projects.
> - `Sales Order Item`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this can be
>   either the sales order that was used to create this task, or a sales
>   order that was linked to this task manually. This field only appears
>   in tasks linked to billable projects.
> - `Allocated Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the amount of
>   time that the work on this task is expected to last, tracked by
>   timesheets.
> - `Deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the expected end date
>   of the task. Once this field is filled in, you can also add a start
>   date to designate the entire time frame of the tasks\' duration.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

- You can also create new tasks by switching to the list or Gantt view
  and clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- The following fields can also be edited directly from the Kanban view
  without opening the individual task: `fa-star-o`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} (**priority**), `Allocated hours`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Assignees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  **task status**. You can also **color code** or `Set a
  Cover image`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to your task by
  clicking the `fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  (**vertical ellipsis**).

- You can use the following keyboard shortcuts in the task title to
  configure new tasks (modify the values in the examples below according
  to your needs):

  - **30h**: to allocate 30 hours to the task.
  - **#tags**: to add tags to the task.
  - **\@user**: to assign the task to a user.
  - **!**: to star the task as high priority.

  Along with using the correct format, follow this order: the task\'s
  name, followed by the allocated time, the tags, the assignee, and then
  the priority.

  For example, if you want to create a task named \"Prepare workshop\",
  allocate 5h hours to it, add the \"School\" tag, assign it to Audrey
  and set its priority to `High`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  enter the following task title: Prepare workshop 5h #school \@Audrey !

  ![Using keyboard shortcuts to create a task in Project.](task_creation/task-shortcuts.png)
::::

## Creating tasks from an email alias {#task_creation/email_alias}

This feature allows for project tasks to be automatically created once
an email is delivered to a designated email address.

To configure it, open the Project app, then click the
`fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} (`vertical
ellipsis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) icon next to the desired
project\'s name. Select `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
then open the `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

Fill in the `Create tasks by sending an email to`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field as follows:

> - **Section of the alias before the @ symbol**: type the name of the
>   email alias, e.g. [contact]{.title-ref}, [help]{.title-ref},
>   [jobs]{.title-ref}.
> - **Domain**: in most cases, this is filled in by default with your
>   `domain
>   <../../../general/email_communication>`{.interpreted-text
>   role="doc"}.
> - **Accept Emails From**: refine the senders whose emails will create
>   tasks in the project.

![View of the email alias chosen on the dashboard view in Odoo Project](task_creation/email-configuration.png)

Once configured, the email alias can be seen under the name of your
project on the Kanban dashboard.

When an email is sent to the alias, the email is automatically converted
into a project task. The following rules apply:

- The email sender is displayed in the `Customer`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field.
- The email subject is displayed in the `Task Title`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field.
- The email body is displayed in the `Description`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field.
- The whole content of the email is additionally displayed in the
  **chatter**.
- All the recipients of the email (To/Cc/Bcc) that are Odoo users are
  automatically added as **followers** of the task.

## Creating tasks from a website form

If you have the Website app installed in your database, you can
configure any form on your website to trigger the creation of tasks in a
project.

1.  Go to the website page where you wish to add the form and
    `add the Form building block
    </applications/websites/website/web_design/building_blocks>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}.
2.  In the website editor, edit the following fields:
    - `Action`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
      `Create a Task`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
    - `Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: choose the project
      that you want the new tasks to be created in.
3.  `Customize the form <website/building_blocks/form>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

When the form is submitted, it automatically creates a project task. The
task\'s content is defined by the form\'s corresponding fields.

# Task dependencies

Odoo Project allows you to break down projects into tasks and establish
relationships between those tasks to determine the order in which they
are executed. Task dependencies ensure that certain tasks begin only
after the preceding tasks are completed.

To enable task dependencies in projects, go to
`Project --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, enable
`Task Dependencies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Set task dependencies

Task dependencies can be created from the task form or the project\'s
Gantt view by linking the successor task (i.e., the task blocked by
other tasks) to its predecessor task(s) (i.e., the tasks blocking the
successor task).

To create task dependencies from the task form, access the desired task
and, in the `Blocked by`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click
`View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to access the predecessor
task. To access the successor tasks from the predecessor task, click the
`Blocked Tasks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button.

To create a task dependency from the Gantt view, hover your mouse over
the predecessor task, then click one of the dots that appear around it.
Drag and drop the dot onto the successor task. An arrow appears,
indicating the dependency from the predecessor task to the successor.

![Task dependency](task_dependencies/task-dependency.png)

Odoo automatically manages task progress based on their dependency.
Successor tasks are assigned the `Waiting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} status and cannot be moved to
`In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} until their predecessor
task(s) are marked as `Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Cancelled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Remove dependencies

To remove a task dependency, proceed as follows:

- From the task form, go to the **Blocked by** tab and click the
  `fa-times`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} (`times`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}) button.
- From the Gantt view, click the red `fa-times`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} (`times`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) button that
  appears at the center of the arrow when you hover your mouse over it.

# Task stages and statuses

## Task stages

Task stages are displayed as columns in the project\'s Kanban view, and
allow you to update the progress of its tasks with a drag-and-drop. In
most projects, the stages will be akin to **New**, **In progress**,
**Backlog**, etc.

By default, task stages are project-specific but can be shared across
multiple projects that follow the same workflow.

### Creating task stages

Odoo Project doesn't provide default stages but instead allows you to
create custom stages tailored to your specific business needs. You are
prompted to do so immediately after `creating a new
project <project_management/configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

To create a stage, type its name into the `Stage...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, then click `Add`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Click `See examples`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to find ideas
for stage names applicable to your line of business.
::::

### Editing task stages

To edit the task stage, click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} (`cog`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) icon next to its
name. From there, click one of the following:

> - `Fold`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to hide the task stage
>   and all of the tasks in this stage from the Kanban view.
> - `Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
>   - `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to change the name of
>     the stage.
>   - `SMS/Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to
>     automatically send an email or SMS notification to the customer
>     when a task reaches this stage.
>   - `Folded in Kanban`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to hide the
>     task stage and all of the tasks in this stage from the Kanban
>     view.
>   - `Projects`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to share this task
>     stage between several projects.
>   - `Automations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to create
>     `custom rules that trigger automatic actions
>     <../../../studio/automated_actions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
>     (e.g., creating activities, adding followers, or sending webhook
>     notifications). Note that this will activate Studio in your
>     database, which may impact your pricing plan.
> - `Delete`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to delete this stage.
> - `Archive/Unarchive all`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to
>   archive or unarchive all of the tasks in this stage.

## Task statuses {#project/tasks/task_stages_statuses/statuses}

Task statuses are used to track the status of tasks within the Kanban
stage, as well as to close the task when it's done or canceled. Unlike
Kanban stages, they cannot be customized; five task statuses exist in
Odoo and are used as follows:

> - `In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this is the
>   default state of all tasks, meaning that work required for the task
>   to move to the next Kanban stage is ongoing.
> - `Changes Requested`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to highlight
>   that changes, either requested by the customer or internally, are
>   needed before the task is moved to the next Kanban stage.
> - `Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to highlight that the
>   task is ready to be moved to the next stage.
> - `Canceled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to cancel the task.
> - `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to close the task once
>   it\'s been completed.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

- The `Changes Requested`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} task statuses are
  cleared as soon as the task is moved to another Kanban stage. The task
  status reverts to the default `In
  Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status so that
  `Changes Requested`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status can be applied
  again once the necessary work has been completed in this Kanban stage.
- The `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Canceled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} statuses are independent
  from the Kanban stage. Once a task is marked as
  `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Canceled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, it is closed. If
  needed, it can be reopened by changing its status.

# Timesheet billing rates and leaderboard

Odoo's **Timesheets** app allows you to set personalized
`billing rate targets <timesheets/billing_rates/targets>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for employees. In addition to billing rate targets, a
`leaderboard <timesheets/billing_rates/leaderboard>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} can be enabled to motivate employees and gamify their
experience. The leaderboard displays the billable and total time logged
by employees, and can be enhanced with
`motivational tips <timesheets/billing_rates/tips>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

## Billing rate indicators {#timesheets/billing_rates/targets}

### Configuration

To enable billing rate indicators, navigate to
`Timesheets --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, then enable
`Billing Rate Indicators`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To set up the targets, click
`Set employee billable time targets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
access the employee form that you wish to edit, navigate to the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, then encode the
monthly `Billing Time Target`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
hours or days, depending on the `Encoding Method`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} selected in the **Timesheets**
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Once the `Billing Rate Indicators`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
have been enabled, you can also set the employees\'
`Monthly Billing Time Target`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
directly from the **Employees** app.
::::

### Using the billing rate indicators

Once enabled, the billing rate indicators are displayed in the upper
right corner of the `My Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
menu in Kanban, grid, and list views for all users. The monthly amount
of time logged by the user is displayed in the following format:
**logged billable time / billable time target**. The percentage of
completion of the billing rate target is also displayed, highlighted in
red if the user falls below the target and in green once the target is
reached.

Below the billing rate indicators, the total monthly amount of time
logged by the user is also displayed.

![Billing rate indicators.](billing_rates/indicators.png)

## Billing rate leaderboard {#timesheets/billing_rates/leaderboard}

### Configuration

After the
`monthly billing time targets <timesheets/billing_rates/targets>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} have been enabled, Odoo offers the possibility of activating
a **billing rate leaderboard** in order to motivate employees and
enhance workplace transparency.

To enable the billing rate leaderboard, navigate to
`Timesheets --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, activate
`Billing Rate Leaderboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then
click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Using the billing rate leaderboard

The billing rate leaderboard is then displayed in the upper right corner
of the `My Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view, next to
the billing rate indicators. It displays the current top three
performers who have logged the highest percentage of their allocated
billing hours.

It also shows the amount of time logged by the signed-in user in the
format: logged billable time / billable time target, as well as the
total time logged.

Clicking on the area of the top three performers opens the leaderboard
for all team members. Use the drop-down menu in the upper left corner to
switch between the `Billing Rate Leaderboard`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and the `Total Time Leaderboard`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, which displays the total time logged by team members
across billable and internal projects.

![Billing rate leaderboard.](billing_rates/leaderboard.png)

## Leaderboard tips {#timesheets/billing_rates/tips}

**Daily motivational tips**, displayed on the right side of the
leaderboard, enhance the billing rate and total time leaderboard. The
tips are randomly selected and change daily.

To create or edit existing tips, navigate to
`Timesheets --> Configuration --> Tips`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or double-click a tip\'s text.

# Time off entries

Odoo automatically generates timesheet entries on projects and tasks
once a time off request is approved. This streamlines timesheet
validation by ensuring approved time off is accurately reflected in
timesheets.

## Configuration {#timesheets/config}

First, activate the `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, then open the **Timesheets** app, and navigate to
`Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Scroll to the `Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section and
enable the `Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.
Enabling this option creates timesheet entries for validated time off
requests and public holidays.

Once enabled, two fields appear: `Project`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Task`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
default selection for `Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
`Internal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the default selection
for `Task`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
`Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. These inform Odoo where
to log the time off requests, which project, and task. These can be
modified, if desired, using the drop-down menu.

:::: note

Note

The available options presented vary based on the installed
applications.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Time off categories without validation requirements create timesheet
records instantly. Requests requiring validation creates timesheet
entries *after* the time off request is approved.

To check if a time off type requires approval, check the
`Approvals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
`time off type form <time_off/time-off-requests>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

## Workflow

Once the employee has
`requested time off <../../hr/time_off/request_time_off>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, and the request has been validated, if necessary, the time
is automatically logged on the **Timesheets** app, under the respective
project and task.

To view the logged entry, open the **Timesheets** app and navigate to
the relevant time period. The time off appears in the corresponding
field, according to the `configuration
<timesheets/config>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

To view the timesheet entry details, click the
`fa-search`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(magnifying glass)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon that
appears when hovering over the entry, and the detailed timesheet
information appears.

::: example
An employee is attending internal training the week of December 15-19,
2025, and logs their time in the **Timesheets** app under the
[Internal]{.title-ref} project, with a task of [Training]{.title-ref}.
On December 19, 2025, the employee is home sick, and requests the day
off in the **Time Off** app.

The *time off type* they request is *Sick Time off*, which is configured
to **not** require validation. The employee\'s time off request is
automatically approved, and is logged in the **Timesheets** app, under
the [Internal]{.title-ref} project, and the [Time Off]{.title-ref} task.

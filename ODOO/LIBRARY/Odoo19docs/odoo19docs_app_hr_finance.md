# Bank synchronization

Odoo synchronizes directly with your bank institution to automatically
import all bank transactions into the database. It supports over 26,000
financial institutions worldwide and relies on multiple
`third-party providers <accounting/bank-synchronization/third-party-providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to connect with banks.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To use this service, a valid Odoo Enterprise subscription is required.
::::

:::: tip

To check if your bank is compatible with Odoo, go to [Odoo Accounting
Features](https://www.odoo.com/app/accounting-features#part_5), and
click `See list of
supported institutions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Bank & Cash`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

## Configuration {#accounting/bank-synchronization/configuration}

### First synchronization {#accounting/bank-synchronization/first-synchronization}

To synchronize the database with a bank, go to the Accounting Dashboard,
click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select the
`Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} card. In the
`Add a Bank Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window, select
the relevant bank and click `Connect`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- Alternatively, click the `fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(vertical ellipsis)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon of the `Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} journal, and
`Connect bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or click
`Search over 26000
banks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the Accounting dashboard. -
Depending on your bank and country, you can select the
`Type of account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and/or choose
another
`third-party provider <accounting/bank-synchronization/third-party-providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to connect with the bank if needed before clicking
`Connect`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. - If your bank is not
listed in the `Search for an institution`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} window, scroll down the list and click
`fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Add new bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a bank
account manually. Fill in the `Account Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`SWIFT Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`Connect`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. A bank journal is then
created and named using the account number. Note that in this case, the
bank is not synchronized. - If issues occur during the first
synchronization, check that no firewall or proxy is blocking the address
<https://production.odoofin.com/>. Make sure your web browser allows
pop-ups and that any ad-blocker is disabled.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When setting up bank synchronization, accounting transactions are
automatically recorded from the date of the last transaction +1 day
(e.g., if the last transaction date is 31/12/2025, the recording starts
on 01/01/2026). If the journal contains no transactions, all available
past transactions are retrieved. To limit the retrieval period, go to
`Accounting -->
Accounting --> Lock Dates`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
set a date in the `Lock Everything`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Some banks are in a `Beta`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status,
meaning they\'re not yet fully supported by third-party providers. This
may lead to bugs or other issues. Although they can be used, Odoo does
not provide technical support in this case. - The
`third-party provider <accounting/bank-synchronization/third-party-providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} may request more information to connect with a bank. This
information is not stored on Odoo\'s servers. - To view all past
synchronizations, activate the
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and go
to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Online Synchronization`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

### Manual synchronization {#accounting/bank-synchronization/manual-synchronization}

After the
`first synchronization <accounting/bank-synchronization/first-synchronization>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, bank journals are synchronized by default every twelve
hours. To manually trigger synchronization, go to the Accounting
dashboard and click `Fetch Transactions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the relevant bank journal.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Alternatively, activate the
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Online Synchronization`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select the relevant bank, and click
`Fetch transactions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Some banks do not support automatic transaction fetching. For these
institutions, an error message appears during the automatic account
synchronization, prompting the user to disable the automatic
synchronization. This message is also logged in the chatter of the
online synchronization. In such cases, disable the
`Automatic synchronization`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option in
the corresponding bank\'s `Online Synchronization`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and make sure to perform manual synchronizations by
clicking `Fetch Transactions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
relevant bank journal. - For some bank institutions, transactions can
only be fetched up to three months in the past. If older transactions
are needed, they can be
`imported <accounting/transactions/import>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

### Update synchronization credentials {#accounting/bank-synchronization/update-credentials}

To update bank credentials, activate the
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and go
to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Online Synchronization`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Open the connection that needs to be updated,
click `Update Credentials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
follow the steps.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- The steps may vary depending on the third-party provider, as each
provider follows its own process. - When updating bank credentials, make
sure all accounts are selected for synchronization, including those from
other banking institutions if applicable.
::::

### Third-party providers {#accounting/bank-synchronization/third-party-providers}

Odoo relies on third-party providers to securely connect to your bank
accounts and automatically import transactions and financial data into
the database. The following providers are used:

- [Plaid](https://plaid.com/discover-apps/) (supported in the [United
  States of America and Canada](https://plaid.com/docs/institutions/))
- [Yodlee](https://www.yodlee.com/) (supported in Europe)
- [Salt Edge](https://www.saltedge.com/) (supported
  [worldwide](https://www.saltedge.com/products/account_information/coverage))
- `Ponto <bank_synchronization/ponto>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
  (supported in Europe)
- [Enable Banking](https://enablebanking.com/) (supported in
  [Scandinavian countries](https://enablebanking.com/open-banking-apis))

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

When
`connecting a bank to Odoo <accounting/bank-synchronization/first-synchronization>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}:

- Depending on your bank and country, change the default third-party
  provider when selecting the bank, if necessary.
- Make sure to check the consent checkbox to allow information to be
  shared with Odoo.
- Select all accounts that need access and synchronization, including
  those from other banking institutions.

:::

## Duplicate transactions {#accounting/bank-synchronization/duplicate-transactions}

When importing transactions, some may appear
`duplicated <accounting/transactions/duplicate>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} due to the same online transaction identifier or the same
currency, amount, account number, and date.

## Missing transactions {#accounting/bank-synchronization/missing-transactions}

Missing or pending transactions are entries that the bank has not yet
validated.

To find missing and pending transactions, access the
`bank reconciliation view
<accounting/reconciliation/access>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, click
the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(gear)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon, and select
`Find Missing Transactions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To import a posted missing transaction, select it and click
`Import Transactions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Make sure the connection with the bank is active to find missing
transactions. - `Pending`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
transactions cannot be imported.
::::

## Troubleshooting {#accounting/bank-synchronization/troubleshooting}

::: seealso
`Bank synchronization troubleshooting - Ponto
<accounting/bank-synchronization/ponto/troubleshooting>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
:::

### Synchronization errors or disconnections {#accounting/bank-synchronization/troubleshooting/synchronization}

To report a connection error to [Odoo
support](https://www.odoo.com/help), activate the
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Online Synchronization`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select
the failed connection, and copy the error description and the reference.

If the connection with the proxy is lost and reconnection using the
`Reconnect`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option isn\'t successful,
contact [support](https://www.odoo.com/help) directly. Provide the
client ID or the error reference from the chatter.

### Why is the synchronization not working in real-time? {#accounting/bank-synchronization/troubleshooting/real-time}

Synchronization is not designed to work in real time, as third-party
providers synchronize accounts at different intervals. To manually
trigger synchronization and retrieve bank transactions, go to the
`Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`Fetch Transactions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Alternatively, to synchronize and fetch transactions, activate the
`developer mode
<developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Online
Synchronization`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Some providers restrict refreshes to once per day. If transactions have
already been fetched, clicking `Fetch Transactions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} again may not retrieve the latest data.

Transactions may appear on a bank account, but cannot be fetched if they
have a `Pending`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status; only
transactions with a `Posted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status
are retrieved.

### Why do my transactions only synchronize when I refresh manually? {#accounting/bank-synchronization/troubleshooting/refresh-manually}

Some banks implement additional security measures and require extra
steps, such as an SMS or email authentication code, or another type of
`MFA (multi-factor authentication)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. As a
result, the third-party provider cannot retrieve transactions until the
security code is provided.

### Why are no transactions visible? {#accounting/bank-synchronization/troubleshooting/visible-transactions}

There are a few possible reasons for this issue:

- No bank accounts were synchronized during the `first synchronization
  <accounting/bank-synchronization/first-synchronization>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- There may be no new transactions available to fetch.

If the bank account is correctly linked to a journal, but posted
transactions still aren\'t visible in the database, contact
[support](https://www.odoo.com/help).

### Why are no accounts shown after synchronization? {#accounting/bank-synchronization/troubleshooting/no-account-appearing}

During the synchronization process, a bank institution was selected, but
no bank accounts from this institution were authorized during the
`first synchronization
<accounting/bank-synchronization/first-synchronization>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### Saltedge troubleshooting {#accounting/bank-synchronization/troubleshooting-saltedge}

#### Why is there an error when deleting a synchronization in Odoo? {#accounting/bank-synchronization/troubleshooting/saltedge/deleting-error}

Odoo can\'t permanently delete the connection established with the
banking institution. However, it revokes consent, which prevents Odoo
from accessing the account. The error message indicates that the consent
has been revoked, but the record could not be deleted as it remains in
Salt Edge.

To delete the connection, connect to the [Salt Edge
account](https://www.saltedge.com/dashboard) and manually remove the
synchronization. Once this is done, the record can be deleted in Odoo.

#### I have an error saying that this account has already been synchronized {#accounting/bank-synchronization/troubleshooting/saltedge/account-already-synchronized}

The bank account has already been synchronized with Salt Edge. Access
the Salt Edge [dashboard](https://www.saltedge.com/dashboard) to check
if a connection with the same credentials exists. There are two options:

- If a connection with the same credentials exists in Salt Edge but has
  not been synchronized with Odoo, delete the existing connection and
  create a new one from the Odoo database.
- If a connection with the same credentials exists in Salt Edge and has
  already been synchronized with Odoo,
  `update the synchronization credentials
  <accounting/bank-synchronization/update-credentials>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} to reactivate the connection.

# Manage a bank account in a foreign currency

In Odoo, every transaction is recorded in the default currency of the
company, and reports are all based on that default currency. When you
have a bank account in a foreign currency, for every transaction, Odoo
stores two values:

- The debit/credit in the currency of the *company*;
- The debit/credit in the currency of the *bank account*.

Currency rates are updated automatically using the web services of a
banking institution. By default, Odoo uses the European Central Bank\'s
web services but other options are available.

## Configuration

### Activate multi-currencies

To work with multiple currencies, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings
--> Currencies`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and tick
`Multi-Currencies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Under
`Post Exchange difference
entries in:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, provide a
`Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
`Gain Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
`Loss Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and then click on
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Configure currencies

Once Odoo is configured to support multiple currencies, they are all
created by default, but not necessarily active. To activate the new
currencies, click on `Activate Other Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} under the `Multi-Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} setting or go to `Accounting --> Configuration
--> Accounting: Currencies`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

When the currencies are activated, you can choose to **automate** the
currency rate update, or leave it on **manual**. To configure the rate
update, go back to `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings --> Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, check
`Automatic Currency Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, set
`Interval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to your desired frequency,
and then click on `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. You also
have the option to choose the `Service`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} you wish to obtain currency rates from.

Click on the Update now button (`🗘`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"})
besides the `Next Run`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
update the currency rates manually.

### Create a new bank account

In the accounting application, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and create a new one. Enter a
`Journal Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and set the
`Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to [Bank]{.title-ref}. In the
`Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, enter a
**short code**, a **currency**, and then finally click on the
`Bank Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to create a new
account. In the pop-up window of the account creation, enter a name, a
code (ex.: 550007), set its type to [Bank and Cash]{.title-ref}, set a
currency type, and save. When you are back on the **journal**, click on
the `Account Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and in
the pop-up window, fill out the `Account Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of your
account, and save.

![Example of a created bank journal.](foreign_currency/foreign-journal.png){.align-center}

Upon creation of the journal, Odoo automatically links the bank account
to the journal. It can be found under
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Accounting: Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

## Vendor bill in a foreign currency

To pay a bill in a foreign currency, simply select the currency next to
the `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field and register the
payment. Odoo automatically creates and posts the foreign **exchange
gain or loss** as a new journal entry.

![How to set a bill currency.](foreign_currency/foreign-bill-currency.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Note that you can pay a foreign bill with another currency. In that
case, Odoo automatically converts between the two currencies.
::::

## Unrealized Currency Gains/Losses Report

This report gives an overview of all unrealized amounts in a foreign
currency on your balance sheet, and allows you to adjust an entry or
manually set an exchange rate. To access this report, go to
`Reporting --> Management: Unrealized Currency Gains/Losses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. From here, you have access to all open entries in
your **balance sheet**.

![View of the Unrealized Gains/Losses journal.](foreign_currency/foreign-gains-losses.png){.align-center}

If you wish to use a different currency rate than the one set in
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings --> Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click the `Exchange Rates`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button and change the rate of the foreign currencies in
the report.

![Menu to manually change exchange rates.](foreign_currency/foreign-exchange-rates.png){.align-center}

When manually changing **exchange rates**, a yellow banner appears
allowing you to reset back to Odoo\'s rate. To do so, simply click on
`Reset to Odoo's Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Banner to reset back to Odoo\'s rates.](foreign_currency/foreign-reset-rates.png){.align-center}

In order to update your **balance sheet** with the amount of the
`adjustment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, click on the
`Adjustment Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. In the
pop-up window, select a `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Expense Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Income Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to calculate and
process the **unrealized gains and losses**.

You can set the date of the report in the `Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. Odoo automatically reverses the booking entry to
the date set in `Reversal Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Once posted, the `adjustment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column
should indicate [0.00]{.title-ref}, meaning all **unrealized
gains/losses** have been adjusted.

![Unrealized Currency Gains/Losses report once adjusted.](foreign_currency/foreign-adjustment.png){.align-center}

# Internal transfers

Internal money transfers can be handled in Odoo. At least two bank or
cash accounts are needed to make internal transfers.

::: seealso
`How to add an additional bank account <accounting/bank/create>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
:::

## Configuration

An internal transfer account is automatically created on your database
based on your company\'s
`localization <../../fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and depending on your country's legislation. To modify the
default `Internal Transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} account,
go to `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
scroll down to the `Default Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section.

## Register an internal transfer from one bank to another

When money is transferred from one bank or cash account to another, that
amount appears as two transactions on the corresponding journals,
whether the transactions are created manually, via import, or via
`bank synchronization <bank_synchronization>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. When reconciling the transaction, select the
`Internal Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`reconciliation model <reconciliation_models>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} button. This reconciliation model button writes the
transaction off to the `Internal
Transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} account.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Remember to reconcile the transaction for both the outgoing transaction
on the journal that sends the payment and the incoming transaction on
the journal that receives the payment.
::::

::: example
Take, for example, a transfer of \$1000 from Bank A to Bank B:

- Bank journal (Bank A)

    **Account**                     **Debit**     **Credit**
    ------------------------------- ------------- ------------
    Bank A account                                \$1,000
    **Internal transfer account**   **\$1,000**   

- Bank journal (Bank B)

    **Account**                     **Debit**   **Credit**
    ------------------------------- ----------- -------------
    Bank B account                  \$1,000     
    **Internal transfer account**               **\$1,000**

# Loans management

Odoo\'s loan management gives a comprehensive list of all loans
undertaken by your company in order to maintain a holistic and
forecasted view of upcoming due dates (e.g., cash forecast). Set up
amortization schedules---or import them---and let Odoo automatically
handle monthly interest and principal adjustments so that your financial
reports are always accurate with minimal effort.

## Create a new loan

Create a new loan by going to
`Accounting --> Accounting --> Loans`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. When creating a new loan, there are three options
for how to create amortization schedules:

- importing it from a supported file;
- calculating it from multiple input values (e.g., the
  `Amount Borrowed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
  `Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, etc.) using the
  `Compute`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button;
- manually filling in the lines of the schedule.

In each case, three different fields are required for each line of the
amortization schedule: the `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
the `Principal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Interest`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The `Amount Borrowed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Interest`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields will be red if the
sum of the lines does not match the total of the amortization schedule
lines.

## Loan entries mechanism

When the amount borrowed is credited to a bank account, it should be
transferred to a long-term account (defined in the
`Loan Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab). Then, upon the
validation of the loan, Odoo creates the necessary journal entries so
that there is always a holistic and forecasted view of upcoming due
dates. The entire process is completely automated with a long-term and
short-term principal reclassification mechanism.

For each line of the amortization schedule, Odoo creates the following
entries:

A payment entry on the same date that

:   - debits the principal amount to the long-term account;
    - debits the interest amount to the expense account;
    - credits the payment amount to the short-term account: this is the
      amount that will be withdrawn by the bank.

A reclassification entry on the same date that

:   - debits the sum of the principal amounts of the next 12 months to
      the long-term account;
    - credits the sum of the principal amounts of the next 12 months to
      the short-term account.

A reversed entry of the reclassification entry on *the next day* that
simply reverses the previous one.

With this mechanism, month after month, the short-term account is always
up to date with the current short-term due amounts.

## Closing a loan

By default, a loan will be closed whenever its last payment entry is
posted. However, it can also be manually closed (e.g., because it is
being paid off early) by clicking on the `Close`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. A wizard will appear asking from which date the
loan should be closed. All draft entries after this date will be deleted
too.

A loan can also be cancelled. In that case, all entries will be deleted
even if they were already posted.

## Loans Analysis Report

By going to `Accounting --> Review --> Loans Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, you can access a report with a pivot view of your
ongoing loans. By default, the report shows the principal, interest, and
total payment for each year for the duration of the loan.

# Bank reconciliation

**Bank reconciliation** is the process of validating
`bank transactions <transactions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. Many
of these transactions are matched with counterpart items related to
business records such as
`customer invoices <../customer_invoices>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, `vendor bills <../vendor_bills>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, and `payments <../payments>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"},
while others that may not have a matching counterpart item (such as bank
fees) can be written off
`manually <accounting/reconciliation/set-account>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or with
`reconciliation models <accounting/reconciliation/model>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Not only is bank reconciliation compulsory for most
businesses, but it also offers several benefits, such as reduced risk of
errors in financial reports, detection of fraudulent activities, and
improved cash flow management.

Thanks to the
`default matching rules <accounting/reconciliation/reconcile>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and customizable bank
`reconciliation models <reconciliation_models>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, Odoo selects the matching items automatically when
possible.

## Bank reconciliation view {#accounting/reconciliation/access}

To access a journal\'s `Bank Matching`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} view, go to the
`Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and either:

- click the journal name (e.g., `Bank`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}) or its `Transactions`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} button to display all transactions, including those
  previously reconciled, or
- click the `x to reconcile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
  to display only unreconciled transactions. To include previously
  reconciled transactions, remove the `Not Matched`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} filter from the search bar.

![Reaching the bank reconciliation tool from the accounting dashboard](reconciliation/bank-card.png)

The `Bank Matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view is composed
of lines for each transaction of the journal with the newest displayed
first. Each transaction has a date, a label, a partner (if set), `action
buttons <accounting/reconciliation/action-buttons>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and the transaction amount. Each line can be expanded to
show additional information and buttons.

![The user interface of the bank matching view of a bank journal.](reconciliation/user-interface.png)

:::: note

Note
:::

Once a `transaction <transactions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} is
reconciled, the suggested action button(s) is replaced with the
counterpart entry/entries it was matched with or the account(s) it was
written off to.
::::

### Transactions {#accounting/reconciliation/transactions}

Every `transaction <transactions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} is
linked to a journal entry that debits/credits the journal\'s main
account and its suspense account until it is fully reconciled. At that
point, the suspense account is replaced with the account of the
counterpart item or, in the case of
`manual matching <accounting/reconciliation/set-account>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, the selected account.

#### Possible action buttons {#accounting/reconciliation/action-buttons}

Up to two suggested action buttons are available as primary buttons, but
all available action buttons are displayed when the transaction is
expanded. The following action buttons are available depending on the
details of the transaction:

- `Set Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Open a search view
  to add a partner to the transaction.
- `Set Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Open a search view
  to manually select an account to write off the full amount of the
  transaction with this account. If necessary, `edit the line
  <accounting/reconciliation/edit>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to
  change the amount.
- `Receivable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Write off the
  transaction to the receivable account of the partner.
- `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Open a list view of sales
  orders belonging to the transaction\'s `Partner`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} (or proceed directly to the form view if only one
  relevant sales order exists). Select the relevant sales order(s) and
  click `Create Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then
  return to the `Bank Matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view
  and match the invoice(s) using the `Reconcile`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} action button.
- `Payable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Write off the
  transaction to the payable account of the partner.
- `Reconcile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Open a search view of
  existing items from records such as customer invoices, vendor bills,
  and payments. Select one or multiple items to add counterpart items
  with the corresponding accounts of those items.
- `Batches`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Open a short list of
  `batch payments <../payments/batch>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. To
  view all batch payments, click `Search More ...`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. Select a batch payment to add a counterpart item for
  each payment of the batch with the corresponding account of each
  payment.
- `reconciliation_models`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}: Each manual
  reconciliation model that could apply to the transaction is displayed.
  Click the reconciliation model\'s action button to generate the
  counterpart items defined on the reconciliation model.

`(chevron down)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to the
possible action buttons of an expanded line to display any of the above
action buttons that are hidden due to space limitations, as well as the
following:

- `Upload bills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Upload one or more
  bills to be `digitized
  <../vendor_bills/invoice_digitization>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
  After digitization, the bills are available for matching via the
  `Reconcile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} action button.
- `Manage Models`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Open the list view
  of `reconciliation_models`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

`../../../essentials/in_app_purchase`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Reconcile transactions {#accounting/reconciliation/reconcile}

When possible, Odoo automatically reconciles transactions based on their
fields.

If no partner is set on the transaction, the transaction\'s
`Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is compared with the
`Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Customer Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Bill Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Payment Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of existing
invoices, bills, and payments.

If a partner is set on the transaction, the transaction is instead
matched with invoices, bills, and payments of the partner based on the
`Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The following rules are
used in a sequential order to identify and apply a match:

- Exact match
- Discounted match: for payment terms with discounts for early payments
- Tolerance match: within 3% to account for merchant fees, rounding
  differences, and user errors
- Currency match: when the transaction is in a different currency than
  the invoice, bill, or payment (with a 3% tolerance for exchange rate
  differences)
- Amount in label: if the invoice `Amount`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} is found in the transaction\'s
  `Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

In addition to using these fixed matching rules, transactions can be
matched automatically with the use of
`reconciliation models <reconciliation_models>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. Otherwise, reconcile transactions manually by following
these steps:

1.  Expand the desired line among unmatched bank transactions to display
    all available action buttons.
2.  Define the counterpart. There are several options for defining a
    counterpart, including
    `matching existing items <accounting/reconciliation/existing-items>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, `manually setting
    the account <accounting/reconciliation/set-account>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, matching with `batch payments
    <../payments/batch>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, and using
    `reconciliation model buttons
    <accounting/reconciliation/model>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
3.  If the resulting entry is not fully balanced, add another existing
    counterpart item or write it off by
    `setting the account <accounting/reconciliation/set-account>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} of the remaining amount.

### Existing items {#accounting/reconciliation/existing-items}

To reconcile transactions with existing items related to records such as
customer invoices, vendor bills, and payments, click the
`Reconcile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} action button, select the
matching journal item(s) in the list, and click
`Select`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the `Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set, this list is
automatically filtered to only include items related to that partner.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Use the search bar within the
`Search: Journal Items to Match`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
window to search for specific journal items.
::::

If a transaction amount is lower than the invoice or bill it is
reconciled with, the transaction is fully reconciled, but the difference
remains open on the counterpart item. The remaining amount can be left
open to be reconciled later or the invoice or bill can be marked as
fully paid. To mark the invoice or bill as fully paid,
`edit <accounting/reconciliation/edit>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
the line, click `fully paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To reverse this, `edit
<accounting/reconciliation/edit>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the line
again, click `partial payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If a transaction amount is greater than the invoice or bill it is
reconciled with, the transaction is only partially reconciled. The
remaining balance can be reconciled as any other transaction amount.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Existing items of draft entries can be matched. Eventual automatic moves
(like currency exchange or cash basis moves) are created in draft
simultaneously with the reconciliation. Posting the original entry also
posts the automatic move.
::::

### Set account {#accounting/reconciliation/set-account}

If no existing item matches the selected transaction, you can still
write off the transaction manually: Click
`Set Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then choose the
appropriate account. To write off only part of the transaction,
`edit the line <accounting/reconciliation/edit>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to reflect the correct value and reconcile the remaining
amount as desired.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If the partner is set, write the amount off to their receivable or
payable account directly by clicking the `Receivable`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Payable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`action button
<accounting/reconciliation/action-buttons>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

### Reconciliation models {#accounting/reconciliation/model}

Use `reconciliation models <reconciliation_models>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to create custom rules that can be applied automatically or
manually via custom buttons for operations that are frequently repeated.
These custom buttons allow you to quickly reconcile bank transactions
manually and can also be combined with other reconciliation models and
with counterpart items when reconciling transactions.

::: example
An outgoing bank transaction for \$103 is partially matched with a
vendor bill for \$100, leaving \$3 of the transaction still
unreconciled. Use the `Bank Fees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
reconciliation model to create a new counterpart item for \$3 and
reconcile it with the remaining \$3 of the bank transaction.
:::

## Edit lines and unreconcile transactions {#accounting/reconciliation/edit}

To edit a counterpart item, expand the line, click the
`fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(pencil)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon, and edit the necessary fields in
`Edit Line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When the counterpart item is an existing journal item, some fields are
read-only.
::::

If a transaction is partially matched with a counterpart item, use the
link to mark the invoice as `fully paid`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or to switch back to a
`partial payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To unreconcile a transaction, delete all counterpart items associated
with the transaction by clicking on the `fa-trash`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(trash)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon.

## Netting {#accounting/reconciliation/netting}

Netting (also known as AP/AR offsetting) is the process of balancing
incoming debts from and outgoing debts to the same partner. Reconciling
the incoming and outgoing debts creates a new journal entry that
balances the debts. Two main scenarios exist:

- `A bank transaction balances <accounting/reconciliation/net-transaction>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} (either fully or partially) the incoming and outgoing
  debts.
- `No bank transaction balances <accounting/reconciliation/net-no-transaction>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} the incoming and outgoing debts. This situation can occur
  either when the debts balance each other completely or when the debts
  remain unbalanced.

### Netting with bank transactions {#accounting/reconciliation/net-transaction}

When a bank transaction balances (either fully or partially) the
incoming and outgoing debts, reconcile the bank transaction from the
`Bank Matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view like any other
`existing
items <accounting/reconciliation/existing-items>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}:

1.  Click `Reconcile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
    transaction.
2.  Select all the relevant counterpart items on both the payable and
    receivable side.
3.  Click `Select`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
4.  If a balance remains, depending on the details, the following
    situations are possible:
    - An invoice, bill, or other item is not fully reconciled, and the
      remaining balance can be
      `reconciled <accounting/reconciliation/reconcile>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} with other bank transactions.
    - The bank transaction itself is not fully reconciled, and the
      remaining balance can be
      `reconciled <accounting/reconciliation/reconcile>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} as in any other situation.

### Netting without bank transactions {#accounting/reconciliation/net-no-transaction}

When no bank transaction balances the incoming and outgoing debts, there
is nothing to reconcile from the `Bank Matching`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} view. However, the debt amount is visible in both the
account receivable and the account payable. To balance these debts so
that they no longer appear on the partner ledger, follow these steps:

1.  Go to `Accounting --> Accounting --> Reconcile`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
2.  Select the journal items that debit or credit the account receivable
    and account payable and represent the debts to be netted.
3.  Click `Reconcile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
4.  If the debts don\'t balance each other perfectly, a
    `Write-Off Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} popup window
    appears, allowing you to decide how to resolve the remaining
    balance:
    - Select `Allow partials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to only
      partially reconcile the account receivable and account payable and
      leave the remaining balance open.
    - Use a
      `reconciliation model button <reconciliation_models>`{.interpreted-text
      role="doc"} to write off the balance.
    - Manually choose an `Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
      and optionally adjust the `Tax`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"}, `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
      `Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
      `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
      `To Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields.

The items are then matched, and their balance is removed from the
partner ledger, representing that no payment is due for these debts.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The workflow is the same whether there are only two equal debts in the
receivable and payable accounts or multiple debts in each account.

# Reconciliation models

Reconciliation models are custom rules that complement the
`default set of matching rules
<accounting/reconciliation/reconcile>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
enable more advanced automation of the `bank
reconciliation <reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} process.
These models are especially useful when dealing with recurring flows
like writing off bank fees or `cash discounts
<../customer_invoices/cash_discounts>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

::: seealso
[Odoo Tutorials: Reconciliation
models](https://www.odoo.com/slides/slide/reconciliation-models-6858)

## Configuration {#accounting/rec-models/config}

To access reconciliation models, go to the
`Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click the
`fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(dropdown menu)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu on the bank
journal, and select `Models`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under
the `Reconciliation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

To create a new reconciliation model, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Reconciliation models can be either `Manual`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Automated`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Manual reconciliation models appear as `possible action buttons
<accounting/reconciliation/action-buttons>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} when `reconciling <reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. Automatic reconciliation models apply automatically to
transactions that meet the reconciliation model\'s
`matching conditions <accounting/rec-models/conditions>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Each reconciliation model is configured with `matching conditions
<accounting/rec-models/conditions>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to
identify the relevant bank transactions and `Counterpart
Items <accounting/rec-models/counterpart>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
to be generated during reconciliation.

![Rearrange the sequence of models in the list view.](reconciliation_models/list-view.png)
::::

### Matching conditions {#accounting/rec-models/conditions}

A reconciliation model\'s matching conditions determine to which
transactions it applies.

The following fields can be used to restrict the reconciliation model\'s
availability to transactions that meet the conditions:

- `Journals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Partners`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
  `Is lower than or equal to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Is greater than or
  equal to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Is between`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and enter the
  amount(s).
- `Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
  `Contains`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Not Contains`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or `Match
  Regex`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and enter the transaction
  label\'s matching condition.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

[Regular expressions](https://regexone.com/), often abbreviated as
**regex**, can be used in Odoo in various ways to search, validate, and
manipulate data. Regex can be powerful but also complex, so it\'s
essential to use it judiciously.

To use regular expressions in a reconciliation model, set the
`Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Match Regex`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and add an expression.
Odoo automatically retrieves the transactions that match the regex
expression and the conditions specified in the reconciliation model.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

A transaction must meet all conditions for the reconciliation model to
be available for it. If no condition is defined (i.e., if all fields are
left blank), the reconciliation model will be available for all
transactions.
::::

### Counterpart items {#accounting/rec-models/counterpart}

Each line in the `Counterpart items`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab creates a journal item with the specified details:

- `Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the partner, if
  any, to set on the journal item.
- `Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the account, if
  any, to set on the journal item.
- `Amount Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select how the
  amount of the journal item should be calculated:
  - `Fixed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Use a fixed amount.
  - `Percentage of balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Use a
    percentage of the remaining balance of the transaction, regardless
    of the transaction total.
  - `Percentage of statement line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    Use a percentage of the transaction total, regardless of the
    remaining balance of the transaction.
  - `From label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Use a percentage
    from the transaction\'s label using regex.
- `Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the amount to be
  used on the journal item. This field will be either a fixed amount,
  percentage amount, or regex depending on the
  `Account Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select a tax, if any, to
  set on the journal item. This field is hidden behind the
  `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(settings adjust)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon by
  default.
- `Analytic`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select an analytic
  distribution, if any, to set on the journal item.
- `Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a label, if any, to
  set on the journal item.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- While neither the `Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} nor
`Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields are mandatory, at
least one of the two must be set for the reconciliation model to work
correctly. - The reconciliation model can be used for
`partner mapping <accounting/rec-models/partner>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} if the `Counterpart Items`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} include a `Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
but no `Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

## Default reconciliation models {#accounting/rec-models/defaults}

In Odoo, different models are available by default depending on the
company\'s `fiscal
localization <../../fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. These can be updated if needed. The following
reconciliation models exist across most fiscal localizations.

### Internal Transfers

The `Internal Transfers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
reconciliation model is used for making `internal transfers
<internal_transfers>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} from one bank or
cash account to another by moving the entire transaction\'s balance to a
liquidity or internal transfer account. To fully transfer the amount
from one account to another, this reconciliation model must be used on
both the incoming journal\'s transaction and the outgoing journal\'s
transaction.

::: seealso
`internal_transfers`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

### Bank Fees

The `Bank Fees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} reconciliation model
generates a counterpart item that moves the remaining balance of a
transaction to a bank fees account (that varies by `fiscal localization
<../../fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}) and
includes \"Bank Fees\" in the `Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
of the new item that it creates. This reconciliation model is only
applicable to transactions whose label contains \"Bank Fees\" due to its
`matching conditions <accounting/rec-models/conditions>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

::: example
An outgoing bank transaction for \$103 is partially matched with a
vendor bill for \$100, leaving \$3 of the transaction still
unreconciled. Use the `Bank Fees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
reconciliation model to create a new counterpart item for \$3 and
reconcile it with the remaining \$3 of the bank transaction.
:::

### Cash Discount

The `Cash Discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} reconciliation
model generates a counterpart item that moves the remaining balance of a
transaction to a cash discount account (that varies by `fiscal
localization <../../fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}) and includes \"Cash Discount\" in the
`Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the new item that it
creates.

::: seealso
`../customer_invoices/cash_discounts`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Partner mapping {#accounting/rec-models/partner}

Partner mapping allows you to establish rules for automatically matching
transactions to the correct partner account, saving time and reducing
the risk of errors that can occur during manual reconciliation. For
example, you can create a partner mapping rule for incoming payments
with specific reference numbers or keywords in the transaction
description. When an incoming payment meets these criteria, Odoo
automatically maps it to the corresponding customer\'s account.

To create a partner mapping rule, configure any `matching conditions
<accounting/rec-models/conditions>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, such
as a specific transaction label, and then configure the
`Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and any other relevant
fields in the `Counterpart Items
<accounting/rec-models/counterpart>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} tab.
Setting an `Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is not mandatory
for partner mapping.

# Transactions

Importing transactions from your bank statements allows keeping track of
bank account transactions and reconciling them with the ones recorded in
your accounting.

`Bank synchronization <bank_synchronization>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} automates the process. However, if you do not want to use it
or if your bank is not yet supported, other options exist:

- `Import bank transactions <accounting/transactions/import>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} delivered by your bank;
- `Register bank transactions <accounting/transactions/register>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} manually.

:::: note

## Transaction view {#accounting/transactions/view}

The list of transactions for the bank journal is displayed in the
`Bank Matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view. To access it,
go to the `Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
then either:

- click the journal name (e.g., `Bank`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}) or its `Transactions`{.interpreted-text

## Duplicate transactions {#accounting/transactions/duplicate}

Duplicate transactions occur when either by human error or
`bank sync <bank_synchronization>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} error,
the same transaction is created multiple times. The duplicate
transaction view identifies potential duplicate transactions so they can
be selected and deleted. To access the duplicate transaction view, first
access the `Bank Matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view by
going to the `Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and clicking the bank journal\'s name, then open the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} menu and click
`Find Duplicate Transactions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Potential duplicate transactions are identified based on their amount,
date, and account number, or (if the transaction is created via
`bank sync <bank_synchronization>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}) the
transaction ID.

Select a `Starting Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to view the
corresponding potential duplicate transactions, then select the
transactions to delete and click `fa-trash`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Delete Selected`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Any transactions created by
`bank sync <bank_synchronization>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} that
the bank sync provider determines to be potential duplicates are
displayed in the `Provider Duplicates`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. This tab is only visible if there are any
potential duplicates according to the provider.
::::

## Import transactions {#accounting/transactions/import}

Odoo supports multiple file formats to import transactions:

- SEPA recommended Cash Management format (CAMT.053)
- Comma-separated values (CSV)
- Excel (XLSX)
- Open Financial Exchange (OFX)
- Quicken Interchange Format (QIF)
- Belgium: Coded Statement of Account (CODA)

To import a file, go to the `Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, click the `fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(ellipsis)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon on the
`Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} journal, and select
`Import file`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Next, select the file
and upload it.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Alternatively, access the transaction list by: - clicking on the
`Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} journal\'s name, then clicking
`Upload`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} - dragging and dropping a
file on the bank journal on the `Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} - dragging and dropping a file on the
`Bank Matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view
::::

Certain file types such as CSV and XLSX, then require setting the
necessary formatting options and mapping the file columns with their
related Odoo fields, after which you can run a `Test`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Import`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} your
bank transactions. Other file types are mapped automatically.

::: seealso
`/applications/essentials/export_import_data`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Register bank transactions manually {#accounting/transactions/register}

You can also record your bank transactions manually. To do so, go to the
`Accounting
Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click the
`Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} journal\'s name, and then on
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
`Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is optional to ease
the reconciliation process, but the `Label`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields
are mandatory.

## Statements {#accounting/transactions/statements}

A **bank statement** is a document provided by a bank or financial
institution that lists the transactions that have occurred in a
particular bank account over a specified period of time.

In Odoo Accounting, it is optional to group transactions by their
related statement, but depending on your business flow, you may want to
record them for record-keeping and organizational purposes.

To access a list of existing statements, go to the
`Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click the
`fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(dropdown menu)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon next to the
bank or cash journal you want to check, then click
`Statements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To ensure the ending balances of your bank statements in Odoo align with
the ending balances of the statements that are provided by your bank,
create an opening transaction to record the bank account balance as of
the date you begin synchronizing or importing transactions. This is
necessary to ensure the accuracy of your accounting.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To access a statement\'s transactions, click
`Transactions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} directly from the
`Bank Statements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list view or open a
statement and click the `Statement
lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button.
::::

### Statement creation {#accounting/transactions/statement-kanban}

The `Bank Matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view displays
transactions from most recent to oldest and groups them by statement,
with any recent transactions that do not belong to a statement at the
top. To add transactions to a statement, hover on the most recent
transaction that should be included in the statement, and click the
`Statement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button that appears on
the upper separator line. Doing so creates a statement from that
transaction down to the oldest transaction that is not yet part of a
statement.

![A \"Statement\" button is visible when hovering on a transaction.](transactions/statements-kanban.png)

In the `Create Statement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window,
fill out the statement\'s `Reference`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, verify its `Starting Balance`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Ending Balance`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, add an attachment such as a PDF of the statement if
desired, and click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Transactions can also be added to statements from the list view. Select
all the transactions corresponding to the bank statement, and, in the
`Statement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, select an
existing statement or create a new one by typing its reference, clicking
on `Create and
edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, filling out the
statement\'s details, and saving.
::::

### Statement viewing, editing, and printing {#accounting/transactions/view-edit-print}

To view an existing statement, click the statement amount in the
`Bank Matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view or click the
statement name and then the `fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Internal link)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon
in the `Bank Matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list view.
From here, you can edit the `Reference`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Starting Balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Ending Balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Attachments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Manually updating the `Starting Balance`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} automatically updates the `Ending
Balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} based on the new value of
the `Starting Balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the value
of the statement\'s transactions. - If the
`Starting Balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} doesn\'t equal the
previous statement\'s `Ending
Balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or if the
`Ending Balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} doesn\'t equal the
running balance (`Starting Balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
plus the statement\'s transactions), a warning appears explaining the
issue. To maintain flexibility, it is still possible to save without
first resolving the issue.
::::

To generate and print a PDF of the bank statement, click the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(gear)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon and click `fa-print`{.interpreted-text

# Cash discounts and tax reduction

**Cash discounts** are reductions in the amount a customer must pay for
goods or services offered as an incentive for paying their invoice
promptly. These discounts are typically a percentage of the total
invoice amount and are applied if the customer pays within a specified
time. Cash discounts can help a company maintain a steady cash flow.

::: example
You issue a €100 invoice on the 1st of January. The full payment is due
within 30 days, and you also offer a 2% discount if your customer pays
you within seven days.

The customer can pay €98 up to the 8th of January. After that date, they
would have to pay €100 by the 31st of January.
:::

A `tax reduction <cash-discounts/tax-reductions>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} can also be applied depending on the country or region.

::: seealso
\- `payment_terms`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} -
`../payments`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Configuration {#cash-discounts/configuration}

To grant cash discounts to customers, you must first verify the
`gain and loss accounts
<cash-discounts/gain-loss-accounts>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
Then, configure `payment terms
<cash-discounts/payment-terms>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and add a
cash discount by checking the `Early Discount`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox and filling in the discount percentage,
discount days, and `tax
reduction <cash-discounts/tax-reductions>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
fields.

### Cash discount gain/loss accounts {#cash-discounts/gain-loss-accounts}

With a cash discount, the amount you earn depends on whether the
customer benefits from the cash discount or not. This inevitably leads
to gains and losses, which are recorded on default accounts.

To modify these accounts, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and, in the `Default Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, select the accounts you want to use for the
`Cash Discount Gain account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Cash Discount Loss account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Payment terms {#cash-discounts/payment-terms}

Cash discounts are defined on
`payment terms <payment_terms>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. Configure
them to your liking by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and make sure to fill out the discount
percentage, discount days, and
`tax reduction <cash-discounts/tax-reductions>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} fields.

![Configuration of payment terms named \"2/7 Net 30\". The field \"Description on Invoices\"
reads: \"Payment terms: 30 Days, 2% Early Payment Discount under 7 days\".](cash_discounts/payment-terms.png)

### Tax reductions {#cash-discounts/tax-reductions}

Depending on the country or region, the base amount used to compute the
tax can vary, which can lead to a **tax reduction**. Since tax
reductions are set on individual payment terms, each term can use a
specific tax reduction.

To configure how the tax reduction is applied, go to a payment term with
the `Early
Discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox enabled, and
select one of the three following options:

- 

  Always (upon invoice)

  :   The tax is always reduced. The base amount used to compute the tax
      is the discounted amount, whether the customer benefits from the
      discount or not.

- 

  On early payment

  :   The tax is reduced only if the customer pays early. The base
      amount used to compute the tax is the same as the sale: if the
      customer benefits from the reduction, then the tax is reduced.
      This means that, depending on the customer, the tax amount can
      vary after the invoice is issued.

- 

  Never

  :   The tax is never reduced. The base amount used to compute the tax
      is the full amount, whether the customer benefits from the
      discount or not.

::::::: example
You issue a €100 invoice (tax-excluded) on the 1st of January, with a
21% tax rate. The full payment is due within 30 days, and you also offer
a 2% discount if your customer pays you within seven days.

:::::: tabs

configured. - The **type of cash discount tax reduction** may be
correctly pre-configured, depending on your
`fiscal localization package <fiscal_localizations/packages>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

## Apply a cash discount to a customer invoice {#cash-discounts/customer-invoice}

On a customer invoice, apply a cash discount by selecting the
`payment terms you created
<cash-discounts/payment-terms>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Odoo
automatically computes the correct amounts, tax amounts, due dates, and
accounting records.

Under the `Journal Items`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, you
can display the discount details by clicking on the \"toggle\" button
and adding the `Discount Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Discount Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns.

![An invoice of €100.00 with \"2/7 Net 30\" selected as payment terms. The \"Journal Items\" tab
is open, and the \"Discount Date\" and \"Discount Amount\" columns are displayed.](cash_discounts/invoice-journal-entry.png)

The discount amount and due date are also displayed on the generated
invoice report sent to the customer if the
`Show installment dates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is
checked on the payment terms.

![An invoice of €100.00 with the following text added to the terms and conditions: \"30
Days, 2% Early Payment Discount under 7 days. 118.58 € due if paid before 01/08/2023.\"](cash_discounts/invoice-print.png)

### Payment reconciliation

When you record a `payment <../payments>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
or `reconcile your bank transactions
<../bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, Odoo takes the
customer payment\'s date into account to determine if the customer can
benefit from the cash discount or not.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If your customer pays the discount amount *after* the discount date, you
can always decide to mark the invoice as fully paid with a write-off or
as partially paid.
::::




--- SOURCE: finance/accounting/customer_invoices/cash_rounding.md ---

# Cash rounding

**Cash rounding** is required when the lowest physical denomination of
currency, or the smallest coin, is higher than the minimum unit of
account.

For example, some countries require their companies to round up or down
the total amount of an invoice to the nearest five cents, when the
payment is made in cash.

## Configuration

Go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and enable *Cash Rounding*, then click on *Save*.

![image](cash_rounding/cash_rounding01.png){.align-center}

Go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Cash Roundings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click on *Create*.

Define here your *Rounding Precision*, *Rounding Strategy*, and
*Rounding Method*.

Odoo supports two **rounding strategies**:

1.  **Add a rounding line**: a *rounding* line is added on the invoice.
    You have to define which account records the cash roundings.
2.  **Modify tax amount**: the rounding is applied in the taxes section.

## Apply roundings

When editing a draft invoice, open the *Other Info* tab, go to the
*Accounting Information* section, and select the appropriate *Cash
Rounding Method*.

# Credit notes and refunds

A credit/debit note, or credit/debit memo, is a document sent to a
customer to inform them that they have been *credited/debited* a certain
amount.

Several use cases can lead to a credit note, such as:

> - a mistake in the invoice or vendor bill
> - a return of the goods, or a rejection of the services
> - the goods delivered are damaged

Debit notes are less common but are most frequently used to track debts
owed by customers or to vendors because of modifications to confirmed
customer invoices or vendor bills.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Issuing a credit/debit note is the only legal method for canceling,
refunding, or modifying a validated invoice. Make sure to **register the
payment** afterward if money is being refunded to the customer and/or
validate the
`return </applications/sales/sales/products_prices/returns>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} if a storable product is being returned.
::::

## Issue a customer credit note {#accounting/credit_notes/issue-credit-note}

In most cases, credit notes are created directly from the corresponding
invoices. To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, open the relevant invoice, and click
`Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In the `Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window, fill in
the `Reason displayed on Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and update the `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Reversal date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if needed. There are
two options:

- Click `Reverse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open a draft
  credit note prefilled with the exact details from the original
  invoice. Update the `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and click
  `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This option allows for a
  partial refund or modifications to the credit note.
- Click `Reverse and Create invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  to create a credit note, validate it automatically, reconcile it with
  the related invoice, and open a new draft invoice prefilled with the
  exact details from the original invoice.

To create a credit note from scratch, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Credit
Notes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Filling out a credit note
follows the same process as completing an
`invoice <accounting/invoice/creation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

A credit note sequence starts with [R]{.title-ref} and is followed by
the related document number (e.g., RINV/2025/0004 is associated with the
invoice INV/2025/0004).

    update the `Use Specific Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    and `Debit Note Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields if
    needed.
2.  Enable the `Copy Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option to
    copy the invoice lines and click `Create
    Debit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
3.  In the debit note, update the `Product`{.interpreted-text

# Delivery and invoice addresses

Companies often have multiple locations, and it is common that a
customer invoice should be sent to one address and the delivery should
be sent to another. Odoo\'s **Customer Addresses** feature is designed
to handle this scenario by making it easy to specify which address to
use for each case.

::: seealso
`overview`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Configuration

To specify a sales order\'s invoice and delivery addresses, first go to
`Accounting
--> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
In the `Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
enable `Customer Addresses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

On quotations and sales orders, there are now fields for
`Invoice Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Delivery Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If the customer
has an invoice or delivery address listed on their
`contact record <sales/send_quotations/contact-form-config>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, the corresponding field uses that address, by default, but
any contact\'s address can be used instead.

::: seealso
For more information, refer to the documentation on
`Contact Form Configuration
<sales/send_quotations/contact-form-config>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
:::

## Invoice and deliver to different addresses

Delivery orders and their delivery slip reports use the address set as
the `Delivery
Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the sales order. By
default, invoice reports show both the shipping address and the invoice
address to assure the customer that the delivery is going to the correct
location.

# Deferred revenues

**Deferred revenues**, or **unearned revenues**, are invoices addressed
to customers for goods yet to be delivered or services yet to be
rendered.

The company cannot report them on the current **profit and loss
statement**, or *income statement*, since the goods and services will be
effectively delivered/rendered in the future.

These future revenues must be deferred on the company\'s balance sheet
among the current liabilities until they can be **recognized**, at once
or over a defined period, on the profit and loss statement.

For example, let\'s say a business sells a software license of \$1200
for 1 year. They immediately invoice it to the customer but can\'t
consider it earned yet, as the future months of licensing have not yet
been delivered. Therefore, they post this new revenue in a deferred
revenue account and recognize it on a monthly basis. Each month, for the
next 12 months, \$100 will be recognized as revenue.

Odoo Accounting handles deferred revenues by spreading them in multiple
entries that are posted periodically.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The server checks once a day if an entry must be posted. It might then
take up to 24 hours before you see a change from
`Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to `Posted`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

## Configuration

Make sure the default settings are correctly configured for your
business. To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. The following options are available:

Journal

:   The deferral entries are posted in this journal.

Deferred Revenue

:   Revenues are deferred on this Current Liability account until they
    are recognized.

Generate Entries

:   By default, Odoo
    `automatically generates <customer_invoices/deferred/generate_on_validation>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} the deferral entries when you post a customer invoice.
    However, you can also choose to
    `generate them manually <customer_invoices/deferred/generate_manually>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} by selecting the `Manually & Grouped`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} option instead.

Based on

:   There are three ways to calculate the deferred revenue recognition:

    > - `Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The total amount is
    >   divided equally by the total number of days in the period,
    >   inclusive of the start and end dates.
    > - `Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Each full month
    >   represents an equal proportion of the total amount, regardless
    >   of the actual number of days in that month (standardized basis).
    > - `Full Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Any month
    >   started is treated as a complete month. However, the final month
    >   is only considered full if the period extends to the very last
    >   day of that month.

    Suppose an invoice of \$1200 must be deferred over 12 months.

    - The `Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option accounts for
      different amounts depending on the number of days in each month
      (e.g., \~\$102 for January and \~\$92 for February).
    - The `Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option accounts
      for \$100 each month prorated to the number of days in that month
      (e.g., \$50 for the first month if the
      `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to the 15th
      of the month).
    - The `Full Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option
      considers each month started to be full (e.g., \$100 for the first
      month even if the `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
      is set to the 15th of the month); this means that with the
      `Full Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, a full
      \$100 is recognized in the first partial month, eliminating the
      need for a 13th month to recognize any remainder as would be the
      case when using the `Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
      option.

## Generate deferral entries on validation {#customer_invoices/deferred/generate_on_validation}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Make sure the `Deferred Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
is visible in the `Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab. In most cases, the start of the deferred period should be in the
same month as the `Invoice Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Deferred revenue entries are posted from the invoice date and are
displayed in the report accordingly.
::::

For each line of the invoice that should be deferred, specify the start
and end dates of the deferral period.

If the `Generate Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field in
the **Settings** is set to `On invoice/bill
validation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, Odoo automatically
generates the deferral entries when the invoice is validated. Click the
`Deferred Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button to
see them.

One entry, dated on the same day as the invoice\'s accounting date,
moves the invoice amounts from the income account to the deferred
account. The other entries are deferral entries which, month after
month, move the invoice amounts from the deferred account to the income
account to recognize the revenue.

::: example
You can defer a January invoice of \$1200 over 12 months by specifying a
start date of 01/01/2023 and an end date of 12/31/2023. At the end of
August, \$800 is recognized as an income, whereas \$400 remains on the
deferred account.
:::

## Reporting

The deferred revenue report computes an overview of the necessary
deferral entries for each account. To access it, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Deferred Revenue`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

To view the journal items of each account, click on the account name and
then `Journal
Items`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Deferred revenue report](deferred_revenues/deferred_revenue_report.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Only invoices whose accounting date is before the end of the period of
the report are taken into account.
::::

## Generate grouped deferral entries manually {#customer_invoices/deferred/generate_manually}

If you have a lot of deferred revenues and wish to reduce the number of
journal entries created, you can generate deferral entries manually. To
do so, set the `Generate Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field in the **Settings** to `Manually & Grouped`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Odoo then aggregates the deferred amounts in a single
entry.

At the end of each month, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Deferred Revenue`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click the `Generate Entries`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. This generates two deferral entries:

- One dated at the end of the month which aggregates, for each account,
  all the deferred amounts of that month. This means that a part of the
  deferred revenue is recognized at the end of that period.
- The reversal of this created entry, dated on the following day (i.e.,
  the first day of the next month) to cancel the previous entry.

::: example
There are three invoices deferred based on `Months`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}:

- Invoice A: \$1200 to be deferred from 01/01/2023 to 12/31/2023
- Invoice B: \$600 to be deferred from 01/01/2023 to 12/31/2023
- Invoice C: \$600 to be deferred in a future period (it will appear on
  the `Not
  Started`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column)

In January

:   At the end of January, after clicking the
    `Generate Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, there
    are the following entries:

    - Entry 1 dated on the 31st January:
      - Line 1: Income account -1200 -600 -600 = **-2400** (cancelling
        the total of all invoices)
      - Line 2: Income account 100 + 50 = **150** (recognizing 1/12 of
        invoice A and invoice B)
      - Line 3: Deferred account 2400 - 150 = **2250** (amount that has
        yet to be deferred later on)
    - Entry 2 dated on the 1st February, the reversal of the previous
      entry:
      - Line 1: Income account **2400**
      - Line 3: Income account **-150**
      - Line 2: Deferred account **-2250**

In February

:   At the end of February, after clicking the
    `Generate Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, there
    are the following entries:

    - Entry 1 dated on the 28th February:
      - Line 1: Income account -1200 -600 -600 = **-2400** (cancelling
        the total of all invoices)
      - Line 2: Income account 200 + 100 = **300** (recognizing 2/12 of
        invoice A and invoice B)
      - Line 3: Deferred account 2400 - 300 = **2100** (amount that has
        yet to be deferred later on)
    - Entry 2 dated on the 1st March, the reversal of the previous
      entry.

From March to November

:   The same computation is done for each month until November.

In December

:   There is no need to generate entries in December.

In total

:   If we aggregate everything, we would have:

    - Invoice A and invoice B
    - Two entries (one for the deferral and one for the reversal) for
      each month from January to November
    - Invoice C will be deferred later

    Therefore, at the end of December, invoices A and B are fully
    recognized as income only once in spite of all the created entries
    thanks to the reversal mechanism.

# Electronic invoicing (`EDI (electronic data interchange)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"})

EDI, or electronic data interchange, is the inter-company communication
of business documents, such as purchase orders and invoices, in a
standard format. Sending documents according to an EDI standard ensures
that the system receiving the message can interpret the information
correctly. Various EDI file formats are available depending on your
company\'s country.

The EDI feature allows companies to automate administrative processes.
It may also be required by some governments for fiscal control or to
support administrative procedures. Electronic sending of documents such
as customer invoices, credit notes, or vendor bills is one application
of EDI.

Odoo supports e-invoicing in many countries. Refer to the
`country's page
<accounting/e-invoicing/peppol-country-specific>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for more details.

::: seealso
`Fiscal localizations documentation <../../fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Configuration {#accounting/e-invoicing/configuration}

By default, the format available in the
`send window <accounting/e-invoicing/generation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} depends on the customer\'s country.

To define a specific e-invoicing format for a customer, go to
`Accounting -->
Customers --> Customers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, access
the customer form, go to the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and select the appropriate
`Format`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Customer invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

## E-invoice generation {#accounting/e-invoicing/generation}

From a confirmed invoice, click `Send`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. In the `Print & Send`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} window, enable the relevant e-invoicing format option
(e.g., `by Peppol`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), then click
`Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to generate and attach the
corresponding e-invoicing XML file.

## Peppol {#accounting/e-invoicing/peppol}

The [Peppol](https://peppol.org/about/) network ensures the exchange of
documents and information between companies and governmental
authorities. It is primarily used for electronic invoicing, and its
access points (connectors to the Peppol network) allow companies to send
electronic documents such as customer invoices and credit notes and
receive documents like vendor bills and refunds.

In this case, Odoo acts as both an **access point** and an
`SMP (Service Metadata Publisher)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
enables electronic invoicing transactions without the need to send
invoices or bills by email or post.

### Send invoices {#accounting/e-invoicing/send-invoices}

All posted invoices that are ready to be sent via Peppol can be viewed
in the `Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list view in the
following ways:

- Use the `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  (`adjust settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) button to add
  the `Peppol status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.
- Apply the `Peppol Ready`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter in
  the search bar.

To send the invoice to the customer via Peppol, click
`Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the confirmed invoice form.
In the `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window, enable the
`by Peppol`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option and click
`Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip

Tip
:::

\-
`Multiple invoices <accounting/invoice/sending-multiple-invoices>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} can also be sent in batches via Peppol. - Set the preferred
`Invoice sending <accounting/invoice/sending>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} method for a customer to `by Peppol`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section of the customer form\'s
`Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
::::

The status is updated to `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} once
the invoices have been successfully delivered to the contact\'s access
point.

### Receive vendor bills {#accounting/e-invoicing/receive-vendor-bills}

New documents received via Peppol are checked multiple times a day.
Depending on the
`registration settings <accounting/e-invoicing/peppol-registration>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, received documents are automatically:

- either imported into the purchase journal set in the
  `PEPPOL Electronic Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  section, and corresponding vendor bills are created as drafts;
- or received via the `Documents app
  <accounting/e-invoicing/receive-vendor-bills-documents-app>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To manually trigger the scheduled action used to retrieve incoming
Peppol documents, enable
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, open
the Settings app, go to `Settings -->
Technical --> Scheduled actions`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and search for
`Peppol: retrieve new documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Open the scheduled action, then click `Run Manually`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Make sure the `Documents - Import from Peppol`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} ([documents_account_peppol]{.title-ref}) module is
`installed <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

To receive vendor bills via the
`Documents app <../../../productivity/documents>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, follow these steps:

1.  In the Documents app, create a specific
    `folder <documents/folders>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or enable
    `file
    centralization <documents/file-centralization>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} for `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    documents.
2.  Open the Accounting app, go to
    `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}, and scroll to the
    `PEPPOL Electronic Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    section.
3.  In the `Document Workspace`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    field, choose the relevant folder.
4.  Use the `Document Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
    add tags to incoming Peppol documents for easy identification.
5.  Click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then, open the Document app, navigate to the appropriate folder, select
the relevant vendor bills, and click
`Create Vendor Bill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
corresponding vendor bill is then created.

### Peppol deregistration from Odoo {#accounting/e-invoicing/peppol-deregister}

Only one Peppol receiver registration can be active for each Peppol
endpoint identifier at a time. To stop using Odoo as the Peppol access
point, e.g., to switch to another provider or reconfigure the
registration for a new database, you must first deregister from Peppol.
To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, scroll down to the `PEPPOL
Electronic Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and
click `oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Advanced Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then click
`Remove from Peppol`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and confirm.

Once removed, the Peppol registration is deleted from the database, and
documents can no longer be sent or received via Peppol in Odoo.

# EPC QR codes

European Payments Council quick response codes, or **EPC QR codes**, are
two-dimensional barcodes that customers can scan with their **mobile
banking applications** to initiate a **SEPA credit transfer (SCT)** and
pay their invoices instantly.

In addition to bringing ease of use and speed, it greatly reduces typing
errors that would potentially make for payment issues.

# Incoterms

`Incoterms (International Commercial Terms)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} are standardized trade terms used in international
transactions to define the rights and responsibilities of buyers and
sellers. They establish the obligations related to the delivery of
goods, the transfer of risks, and the distribution of costs between the
parties involved. Incoterms specify important details, such as the point
at which the risk and costs transfer from the seller to the buyer, the
responsibility for transportation, insurance, customs clearance, and
other relevant aspects of the transaction.

:::: note

By default, all 11 Incoterms are available in Odoo:

- **EXW**: Ex works
- **FCA**: Free carrier
- **FAS**: Free alongside ship
- **FOB**: Free on board
- **CFR**: Cost and freight
- **CIF**: Cost, insurance and freight
- **CPT**: Carriage paid to

# Invoicing processes

Depending on your business and the application you use, there are
different ways to automate the customer invoice creation in Odoo.
Usually, draft invoices are created by the system (with information
coming from other documents like sales order or contracts) and
accountant just have to validate draft invoices and send the invoices in
batch (by regular mail or email).

Depending on your business, you may opt for one of the following way to
create draft invoices:

## Sales

### Sales Order ‣ Invoice {#accounting/inv-process/so}

In most companies, salespeople create quotations that become sales order
once they are validated. Then, draft invoices are created based on the
sales order. You have different options like:

- Invoice manually: use a button on the sale order to trigger the draft
  invoice
- Invoice before delivery: invoice the full order before triggering the
  delivery order
- Invoice based on delivery order: see next section

Invoice before delivery is usually used by the eCommerce application
when the customer pays at the order and we deliver afterwards.
(pre-paid)

For most other use cases, it\'s recommended to invoice manually. It
allows the salesperson to trigger the invoice on demand with options:
invoice the whole order, invoice a percentage (advance), invoice some
lines, invoice a fixed advance.

This process is good for both services and physical products.

::: seealso
\- `/applications/sales/sales/invoicing/proforma`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Invoices can also be generated from sales orders created in the `Repairs
app </applications/inventory_and_mrp/repairs>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for invoicing after-sales services.
::::

### Sales Order ‣ Delivery Order ‣ Invoice

Retailers and eCommerce usually invoice based on delivery orders,
instead of sales order. This approach is suitable for businesses where
the quantities you deliver may differs from the ordered quantities:
foods (invoice based on actual Kg).

This way, if you deliver a partial order, you only invoice for what you
really delivered. If you do back orders (deliver partially and the rest
later), the customer will receive two invoices, one for each delivery
order.

::: seealso
\-
`/applications/sales/sales/invoicing/invoicing_policy`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

### eCommerce Order ‣ Invoice

An eCommerce order will also trigger the creation of the order when it
is fully paid. If you allow paying orders by check or wire transfer,
Odoo only creates an order and the invoice will be triggered once the
payment is received.

## Contracts

### Regular Contracts ‣ Invoices

If you use contracts, you can trigger invoice based on time and material
spent, expenses or fixed lines of services/products. Every month, the
salesperson will trigger invoice based on activities on the contract.

Activities can be:

- fixed products/services, coming from a sale order linked to this
  contract
- materials purchased (that you will re-invoice)
- time and material based on timesheets or purchases (subcontracting)
- expenses like travel and accommodation that you re-invoice to the
  customer

You can invoice at the end of the contract or trigger intermediate
invoices. This approach is used by services companies that invoice
mostly based on time and material. For services companies that invoice
on fix price, they use a regular sales order.

`/applications/sales/sales/invoicing/time_materials`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} -
`/applications/sales/sales/invoicing/expense`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} -
`/applications/sales/sales/invoicing/milestone`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

### Recurring Contracts ‣ Invoices

For subscriptions, an invoice is triggered periodically, automatically.
The frequency of the invoicing and the services/products invoiced are
defined on the contract.

::: seealso
\- `/applications/sales/subscriptions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Others

### Creating an invoice manually

Users can also create invoices manually without using contracts or a
sales order. It\'s a recommended approach if you do not need to manage
the sales process (quotations), or the delivery of the products or
services.

Even if you generate the invoice from a sales order, you may need to
create invoices manually in exceptional use cases:

- if you need to create a refund
- If you need to give a discount
- if you need to change an invoice created from a sales order
- if you need to invoice something not related to your core business

### Resequencing of the invoices

It remains possible to resequence the invoices but with some
restrictions:

1.  The feature does not work when entries are previous to a lock date.
2.  The feature does not work if the sequence is inconsistent with the
    month of the entry.
3.  It does not work if the sequence leads to a duplicate.
4.  The order of the invoice remains unchanged.
5.  It is useful for people who use a numbering from another software
    and who want to continue the current year without starting over from
    the beginning.

### Invoice digitization with optical character recognition (OCR)

**Invoice digitization** is the process of automatically encoding
traditional paper invoices into invoices forms in your accounting.

Odoo uses OCR and artificial intelligence technologies to recognize the
content of the documents. Vendor bills and customer invoices forms are
automatically created and populated based on scanned invoices.

# Payment terms and installment plans

**Payment terms** specify all the conditions of a sale\'s payment to
help ensure customers pay their invoices correctly and on time.

Payment terms are generally defined on documents such as sales orders,
customer invoices, and vendor bills. Payment terms cover:

- The due date(s)
- Early payment discounts
- Any other conditions on the payment

An **installment plan** allows the customers to pay an invoice in parts,
with the amounts and payment dates defined beforehand by the seller.

::: example
Immediate Payment The full payment is due on the day of the invoice\'s
issuance. 15 Days (or Net 15) The full payment is due 15 days after the
invoice date. 21 MFI The full payment is due by the 21st of the month
following the invoice date. 30% Advance End of Following Month 30% is
due on the day of the invoice\'s issuance. The remaining balance is due
at the end of the following month. 2% 10, Net 30 EOM A 2%
`cash discount <cash_discounts>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} if the
payment is received within ten days. Otherwise, the full payment is due
at the end of the month following the invoice date.
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Payment terms are not to be confused with `down payment invoices
</applications/sales/sales/invoicing/down_payment>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. If, for a specific order, you issue multiple invoices to
your customer, that is neither a payment term nor an installment plan
but an invoicing policy. - This page is about the *payment terms*
feature, not `terms & conditions
<terms_conditions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, which can be used to
declare contractual obligations regarding content use, return policies,
and other policies surrounding the sale of goods and services.

## Configuration {#accounting/payment-terms/configuration}

To create new payment terms, follow these steps:

1.  Go to
    `Accounting --> Configuration --> Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and click on `New`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

2.  Enter a name in the `Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field. This field is the name displayed both
    internally and on sales orders.

3.  Tick the `Early Discount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    checkbox and fill out the discount percentage, discount days, and
    `tax reduction <cash-discounts/tax-reductions>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} fields to add a `cash discount
    <cash_discounts>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, if desired.

4.  In the `Due Terms`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, add a
    set of rules (terms) to define what needs to be paid and by which
    due date(s). Defining terms automatically calculates the payments\'
    due date(s). This is particularly helpful for managing **installment
    plans** (`payment terms with multiple
    terms`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}).

    To add a term, click on `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, define the discount\'s value and type in the
    `Due`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields, then fill out the
    `After`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields to determine the
    due date.

    :::: tip
    ::: title
    Tip
    :::

    The `Days end of the month on the`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} option allows you to add a `buffer period
    <accounting/payment-terms/buffer>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} so
    that an invoice registered at the end of the month isn\'t due at the
    beginning of the month that immediately follows.
    ::::

5.  Enter the text to be displayed on the document (sales order,
    invoice, etc.) in the gray textbox in the
    `Preview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

6.  Tick the `Show installment dates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    checkbox to display a breakdown of each payment and its due date on
    the invoice report, if desired.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To instead specify a number of days *before the end of the month*, use a
negative value in the `After`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
::::

To test that your payment terms are configured correctly, enter an
invoice date on the `Example`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line to
generate the payments that would be due and their due dates using these
payment terms.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Terms are computed in the order of their due dates.
::::

::: example
In the following example, 30% is due on the day of issuance, and the
remaining 70% is due at the end of the following month.

![Example of Payment Terms. The first line is the 30% due immediately. The second line is
the remaining 70% due at the end of the following month.](payment_terms/configuration.png)
:::

### End of the month buffer {#accounting/payment-terms/buffer}

The `Days end of the month on the`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option allows users to add a buffer period so that an invoice registered
at the end of the month isn\'t due at the beginning of the month that
immediately follows.

When using this option, Odoo calculates the due date by taking the
invoice date, adding the integer in the `After`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, going to the end of the resulting month, and
then adding the integer from the
`Days on the next month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

::: example
For example, take two invoices, one dated 5 March and the other dated 28
March. Both use the same payment terms with a single
`Due Terms`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line for 100% of the due
amount, due [5]{.title-ref}
`Days end of the month on the`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
[1]{.title-ref}.

For the invoice dated 5 March, the due date is computed as **1 April**
with the following calculations:

- 5 March + 5 days = 10 March
- 10 March + end of the month = 31 March
- 31 March + on the 1 = 1 April

For the invoice dated 28 March, the due date is computed as **1 May**
with the following calculations:

- 28 March + 5 days = 2 April
- 2 April + end of the month = 30 April
- 30 April + on the 1 = 1 May
:::

## Using payment terms {#accounting/payment-terms/use}

Payment terms can be defined using the `Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field on:

- **Contacts:** To automatically set default payment terms on a
  contact\'s new sales orders, invoices, and bills. This can be modified
  in the contact form, under the `Sales &
  Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
- **Quotations/Sales Orders:** To set specific payment terms
  automatically on all invoices generated from a quotation or sales
  order.

Payment terms can be defined using the `Due Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, with the `Terms`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down list on:

- **Customer invoices:** To set specific payment terms on an invoice.
- **Vendor bills:** To set specific payment terms on a bill.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Setting payment terms on a vendor bill is mostly useful for managing
vendor terms with multiple installments or cash discounts. Otherwise,
manually setting the **due date** is enough. If payment terms are
already defined, empty the field to select a date.
::::

## Journal entries {#accounting/payment-terms/journal-entries}

Invoices with specific payment terms generate different *journal
entries*, with one *journal item* for every computed *due date*.

This makes for easier
`follow-ups </applications/finance/accounting/payments/follow_up>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and
`reconciliation </applications/finance/accounting/bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} since Odoo takes each due date into account, rather than
just the balance due date. It also helps to get an accurate
`aged receivable report <accounting/invoices/aging-report>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

::: {.example alt="The amount debited to the account receivable is split into two journal items with
distinct due dates

In this example, an invoice of $1000 has been issued with the following payment terms: *30% is
due on the day of issuance, and the remaining 70% is due at the end of the following month.*

+----------------------+-------------+---------+---------+
| Account              | Due date    | Debit   | Credit  |
+======================+=============+=========+=========+
| Account Receivable   | February 21 | 300     |         |
+----------------------+-------------+---------+---------+
| Account Receivable   | March 31    | 700     |         |
+----------------------+-------------+---------+---------+
| Product Sales        |             |         | 1000    |
+----------------------+-------------+---------+---------+

The $1000 debited to the account receivable is split into two distinct journal items. Both of
them have their own due date."}

# Invoice sequence

When confirming an invoice, Odoo generates a unique invoice reference
number. By default, it uses the sequence format
[INV/year/incrementing-number]{.title-ref} (e.g.,
[INV/2025/00001]{.title-ref}), which restarts from [00001]{.title-ref}
each year.

However, it is possible to
`change the sequence format <accounting/invoice/resequencing>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and its periodicity, and to
`mass-resequence invoices <accounting/invoice/mass-resequencing>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Changes made to reference numbers are logged in the chatter.
::::

## Changing the default sequence {#accounting/invoice/resequencing}

To customize the default sequence, open the last confirmed invoice,
click `Reset to
Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and edit the invoice\'s
reference number.

![Editing the reference number of an invoice.](sequence/reference-number.png)

Odoo then explains how the detected format will be applied to all future
invoices. For example, if the current invoice\'s month is added, the
sequence\'s periodicity will change to every month instead of every
year.

![Editing the reference number of an invoice.](sequence/sequence-dialog.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The sequence format can be edited directly when creating the first
invoice of a given sequence period.
::::

## Mass-resequencing invoices {#accounting/invoice/mass-resequencing}

It can be helpful to resequence multiple invoice numbers. For example,
when importing invoices from another invoicing or accounting system and
the reference originates from the previous software, continuity for the
current year must be maintained without restarting from the beginning.

:::: note

\- To indicate where the sequence change began, the first invoice in the
new sequence is highlighted in red in the
`Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list. This visual
marker is permanent and purely informational. - If there are any
irregularities in the new sequence, such as gaps, cancelled, or deleted
entries within the open period, a
`Gaps in the sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} message
appears in the `Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
journal on the Accounting dashboard. To view more details about the

Resequencing is not possible:

- When entries are before a lock date.
- When the sequence leads to a duplicate.
- When the range is invalid. For example, if the
  `Invoice Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} doesn\'t align with
  the date in the new sequence, such as using a 2024 sequence
  (INV/2024/XXXXX) for an invoice dated in 2025.

# Customer invoices

A customer invoice is a document issued by a company for products and/or
services sold to a customer. It records receivables as they are sent to
customers. Customer invoices can include amounts due for the goods
and/or services provided, applicable sales taxes, shipping and handling
fees, and other charges. Odoo supports multiple invoicing and payment
workflows.

::: seealso
`/applications/finance/accounting/customer_invoices/overview`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

From draft invoice to profit and loss report, the process involves
several steps once the goods (or services) have been ordered/shipped (or
rendered) to a customer, depending on the invoicing policy:

- `accounting/invoice/creation`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
- `accounting/invoice/confirmation`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
- `accounting/invoice/sending`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
- `accounting/invoice/paymentandreconciliation`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `accounting/invoice/followup`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
- `accounting/invoice/reporting`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

## Invoice creation {#accounting/invoice/creation}

Draft invoices can be created directly from documents like sales orders
or purchase orders or manually from the
`Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} journal in the
`Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

An invoice must include the required information to enable the customer
to pay promptly for their goods and services. Make sure the following
fields are appropriately completed:

- `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: When a customer is
  selected, Odoo automatically pulls information from the customer
  record like the invoice address,
  `preferred payment terms <customer_invoices/payment_terms>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"},
  `fiscal positions <taxes/fiscal_positions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, receivable account, and more onto the invoice. To change
  these values for this specific invoice, edit them directly on the
  invoice. To change them for future invoices, change the values on the
  contact record.
- `Invoice Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If not set
  manually, this field is automatically set as the current date upon
  confirmation.
- `Due Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `payment terms <customer_invoices/payment_terms>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: To specify when the customer has to pay the invoice.
- `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Automatically set and
  can be changed if needed.
- `Currency <get_started/multi_currency>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
  If the invoice\'s currency differs from the company\'s currency, the
  currency exchange rate is automatically displayed.

In the `Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:

- `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Click
  `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then search for and
  select the product.
- `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Taxes <taxes>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} (if applicable)

To access the product catalog and view all items in an organized
display, click `Catalog
</applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory/warehouses_storage/inventory_management/product_catalog>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. When the products and quantities are selected, click
`Back to Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to return to the
invoice; the selected catalog items will appear in the invoice lines.

:::: tip

### Sending multiple invoices {#accounting/invoice/sending-multiple-invoices}

To send and print multiple invoices, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select them in the `Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} list view and click `Send`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window
displays the selected invoice sending methods based on the preferred
method set.

A banner is added to the selected invoices to indicate they are part of
an ongoing send and print batch. This helps prevent the process from
being triggered manually again, as it may take some time to complete for
exceptionally large batches.

To check all invoices that have not yet been sent, go to
`Accounting --> Customers
--> Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. In the
`Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list view, click into the
search bar and filter on `Not Sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Payment and reconciliation {#accounting/invoice/paymentandreconciliation}

In Odoo, an invoice is considered `Paid`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} when the associated accounting entry has been
reconciled with a corresponding bank transaction.

::: seealso
\- `payments`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} -
`bank/reconciliation`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Payment follow-up {#accounting/invoice/followup}

Odoo\'s `follow-up actions <payments/follow_up>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} help companies follow up on customer invoices. Different
actions can be set up to remind customers to pay their outstanding
invoices, depending on how much the customer is overdue. These actions
are bundled into follow-up levels that trigger when an invoice is
overdue by a certain number of days. If there are multiple overdue
invoices for the same customer, the actions are performed on the most
overdue invoice.

## Reporting {#accounting/invoice/reporting}

### Partner reports {#accounting/invoice/partner-reports}

# Average price on returned goods

::: {#inventory/avg_cost/definition}
*Average cost valuation* (AVCO) is an inventory valuation method that
evaluates cost based on the total cost of goods bought or produced
during a period, divided by the total number of items on-hand. Inventory
valuation is used to:
:::

- reflect the value of a company\'s assets;
- keep track of the amount of unsold goods;
- account for monetary value in goods that have yet to generate profit;
- report on flow of goods throughout the quarter.

Because `AVCO (Average Cost Valuation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
uses the weighted average to evaluate the cost, it is a good fit for
companies that sell only a few different products in large quantities.
In Odoo, this costing analysis is *automatically updated* each time
products are received.

Thus, when shipments are returned to their supplier, Odoo automatically
generates accounting entries to reflect the change in inventory
valuation. However, Odoo does **not** automatically update the
`AVCO (Average Cost Valuation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
calculation, because
`this can potentially create inconsistencies with inventory
valuation <inventory/avg_price/leaving_inventory>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This document addresses a specific use case for theoretical purposes.
For instructions on how to set up and use
`AVCO (Average Cost Valuation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, refer to
the `inventory valuation cheat sheet
<../../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/inventory_valuation/cheat_sheet>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
::::

## Configuration

To use average cost inventory valuation on a product, navigate to
`Inventory -->
Configuration --> Product Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the category that will be using
`AVCO (Average Cost Valuation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. On the
product category page, set `Costing Method`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to [Average Cost (AVCO)]{.title-ref} and
`Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
[Automated]{.title-ref}.

::: seealso
`Inventory valuation cheat sheet
<../../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/inventory_valuation/cheat_sheet>`{.interpreted-text

## Using average cost valuation

The average cost method adjusts the inventory valuation when products
are received in the warehouse. This section explains how it works, but
if the explanation is unnecessary, skip to the `return
to supplier use case <inventory/avg_cost/return>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} section.

### Formula {#inventory/avg_cost/formula}

When new products arrive, the new average cost for each product is
recomputed using the formula:

$$Avg~Cost = \frac{(Old~Qty \times Old~Avg~Cost) + (Incoming~Qty \times Purchase~Price)}{Final~Qty}$$

- **Old Qty**: product count in stock before receiving the new shipment;
- **Old Avg Cost**: calculated average cost for a single product from
  the previous inventory valuation;
- **Incoming Qty**: count of products arriving in the new shipment;
- **Purchase Price**: estimated price of products at the reception of
  products (since vendor bills may arrive later). The amount includes
  not only the price for the products, but also added costs, such as
  shipping, taxes, and `landed costs
  <../../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/inventory_valuation/landed_costs>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}. At reception of the vendor bill, this price is adjusted;
- **Final Qty**: quantity of on-hand stock after the stock move.

::::: {#inventory/avg_cost/definite_rule}
:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When products leave the warehouse, the average cost **does not** change.
Read about why the average cost valuation is **not** adjusted
`here <inventory/avg_price/leaving_inventory>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::
:::::

### Compute average cost {#inventory/avg_cost/math_table}

To understand how the average cost of a product changes with each
shipment, consider the following table of warehouse operations and stock
moves. Each is a different example of how the average cost valuation is
affected.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Operation               Incoming    Inventory      Qty On Hand Avg Cost
                          Value       Value

  Receive 8 tables at     8 \* \$10   \$80           8           \$10
  \$10/unit                                                      

  Receive 4 tables at     4 \* \$16   \$144          12          \$12
  \$16/unit                                                      

  Deliver 10 tables       -10 \* \$12 \$24           2           \$12
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

:::: {#inventory/avg_cost/ex-1}
::: exercise
Ensure comprehension of the above computations by reviewing the
\"Receive 8 tables at \$10/unit\" example.

Initially, the product stock is 0, so all values are \$0.

In the first warehouse operation, [8]{.title-ref} tables are received at
[\$10]{.title-ref} each. The average cost is calculated using the
`formula <inventory/avg_cost/formula>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:

$$Avg~Cost = \frac{0 + 8 \times $10}{8} = \frac{$80}{8} = $10$$

- Since the *incoming quantity* of tables is [8]{.title-ref} and the
  *purchase price* for each is [\$10]{.title-ref},
- The inventory value in the numerator is evaluated to
  [\$80]{.title-ref};
- [\$80]{.title-ref} is divided by the total amount of tables to store,
  [8]{.title-ref};
- [\$10]{.title-ref} is the average cost of a single table from the
  first shipment.

To verify this in Odoo, in the *Purchase* app, order [8]{.title-ref}
quantities of a new product, [Table]{.title-ref}, with no previous stock
moves, for [\$10]{.title-ref} each.

In the table\'s `Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field in the `General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab of the product form, click the `➡️ (arrow)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon, to open an `External Link`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to edit the product category. Set the
`Costing Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to [Average Cost
(AVCO)]{.title-ref} and `Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to [Automated]{.title-ref}.

Then, return to the purchase order. Click
`Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click `Receive
Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm receipt.

Next, check the inventory valuation record generated by the product
reception by navigating to
`Inventory --> Reporting --> Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select the drop-down for [Table]{.title-ref}, and
view the `Total Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column for the
*valuation layer* (`inventory
valuation at a specific point in time = on-hand quantity * unit price`{.interpreted-text
role="dfn"}). The 8 tables in-stock are worth \$80.

::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

When the product category\'s `Costing Method`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is set to `AVCO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
then the average cost of a product is also displayed on the
`Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, under the
`General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, on the
product page itself.
::::

#### Product delivery (use case)

For outgoing shipments,
`outbound products have no effect on the average cost valuation
<inventory/avg_cost/definite_rule>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
Although the average cost valuation is not recalculated, the inventory
value still decreases because the product is removed from stock and
delivered to the customer location.

::: exercise
To demonstrate that the average cost valuation is not recalculated,
examine the \"Deliver 10 tables\" example.

$$Avg~Cost = \frac{12 \times $12 + (-10) \times $12}{12-10} = \frac{24}{2} = $12$$

1.  Because 10 tables are being sent out to customers, the *incoming
    quantity* is [-10]{.title-ref}. The previous average cost
    ([\$12]{.title-ref}) is used in lieu of a vendor\'s *purchase
    price*;
2.  The *incoming inventory value* is [-10 \* \$12 =
    -\$120]{.title-ref};
3.  The old *inventory value* ([\$144]{.title-ref}) is added to the
    *incoming inventory value* ([-\$120]{.title-ref}), so [\$144 +
    -\$120 = \$24]{.title-ref};
4.  Only [2]{.title-ref} tables remain after shipping out
    [10]{.title-ref} tables from [12]{.title-ref}. So the current
    *inventory value* ([\$24]{.title-ref}) is divided by the on-hand
    quantity ([2]{.title-ref});
5.  [\$24 / 2 = \$12]{.title-ref}, which is the same average cost as the
    previous operation.

To verify this in Odoo, sell [10]{.title-ref} tables in the *Sales* app,
validate the delivery, and then review the inventory valuation record by
going to in `Inventory --> Reporting -->
Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. In the
topmost valuation layer, delivering [10]{.title-ref} tables reduces the
product\'s value by [-\$120]{.title-ref}.

**Note**: What is not represented in this stock valuation record is the
revenue made from this sale, so this decrease is not a loss to the
company.

## Return items to supplier (use case) {#inventory/avg_cost/return}

Because the price paid to suppliers can differ from the price the
product is valued at with the
`AVCO (Average Cost Valuation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} method,
Odoo handles returned items in a specific way.

1.  Products are returned to suppliers at the original purchase price,
    but;
2.  The internal cost valuation remains unchanged.

The above
`example table <inventory/avg_cost/math_table>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} is updated as follows:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Operation               Qty\*Avg    Inventory      Qty On Hand Avg Cost
                          Cost        Value                      
  ----------------------- ----------- -------------- ----------- ---------
                                      \$24           2           \$12

  Return 1 table bought   -1 \* \$12  \$12           1           \$12
  at \$10                                                        
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

In other words, returns to vendors are perceived by Odoo as another form
of a product exiting the warehouse. To Odoo, because the table is valued
at \$12 per unit, the inventory value is reduced by [\$12]{.title-ref}
when the product is returned; the initial purchase price of
[\$10]{.title-ref} is unrelated to the table\'s average cost.

::: example
To return a single table that was purchased for [\$10]{.title-ref},
navigate to the receipt in the *Inventory* app for the
`8 tables purchased in Exercise 1 <inventory/avg_cost/ex-1>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} by going to the `Inventory Overview`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, clicking on `Receipts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and selecting the desired receipt.

Then, click `Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the validated
delivery order, and modify the quantity to [1]{.title-ref} in the
reverse transfer window. This creates an outgoing shipment for the
table. Select `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm
the outgoing shipment.

Return to
`Inventory --> Reporting --> Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to see how the outgoing shipment decreases the
inventory value by \$12.

![Inventory valuation for return.](avg_price_valuation/inventory-valuation-return.png){.align-center}
:::

### Eliminate stock valuation errors in outgoing products {#inventory/avg_price/leaving_inventory}

Inconsistencies can occur in a company\'s inventory when the average
cost valuation is recalculated on outgoing shipments.

To demonstrate this error, the table below displays a scenario in which
1 table is shipped to a customer and another is returned to a supplier
at the purchased price.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Operation                   Qty\*Price   Inventory    Qty On     Avg Cost
                                           Value        Hand       
  --------------------------- ------------ ------------ ---------- --------
                                           \$24         2          \$12

  Ship 1 product to customer  -1 \* \$12   \$12         1          \$12

  Return 1 product initially  -1 \* \$10   **\$2**      **0**      \$12
  bought at \$10                                                   
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the final operation above, the final inventory valuation for the
table is [\$2]{.title-ref} even though there are [0]{.title-ref} tables
left in stock.

::: admonition
Correct method

Use the average cost to value the return. This does not mean the company
gets \$12 back for a \$10 purchase; the item returned for \$10 is valued
internally at \$12. The inventory value change represents a product
worth \$12 no longer being accounted for in company assets.
:::

## Anglo-Saxon accounting

In addition to using `AVCO (Average Cost Valuation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, companies that use **Anglo-Saxon accounting** also keep a
holding account that tracks the amount to be paid to vendors. Once a
vendor delivers an order, **inventory value** increases based on the
vendor price of the products that have entered the stock. The holding
account (called **stock input**) is credited and only reconciled once
the vendor bill is received.

The table below reflects journal entries and accounts. The *stock input*
account stores the money intended to pay vendors when the vendor bill
has not yet been received. To balance accounts when returning products
that have a price difference between the price the product is **valued
at** and the price it was bought for, a *price difference* account is
created.

### Product reception

#### Summary

At product reception, Odoo ensures companies can pay for goods that were
purchased by preemptively moving an amount matching the price of
received goods into the `liability account
</applications/finance/accounting/get_started/cheat_sheet>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, **Stock Input**. Then, once the bill has been received, the
amount in the holding account is transferred to *Accounts Payable*.
Transfers into this account means the bill has been paid. **Stock
Input** is reconciled once the vendor bill is received.

Inventory valuation is a method of calculating how much each in-stock
product is worth internally. Since there is a difference between the
price the product is **valuated at** and the price the product was
actually **purchased for**, the **Inventory Valuation** account is
unrelated to the crediting and debiting operations of the **Stock
Input** account.

To conceptualize all this, follow the breakdown below.

#### Accounts balanced at received products

In this example, a company starts with zero units of a product,
[table]{.title-ref}, in stock. Then, 8 tables are received from the
vendor:

1.  The **Stock Input** account stores [\$80]{.title-ref} of credit owed
    to the vendor. The amount in this account is unrelated to the
    inventory value.
2.  [\$80]{.title-ref} worth of tables came **in** (**debit** the
    *Inventory Value* account [\$80]{.title-ref}), and
3.  [\$80]{.title-ref} must be paid **out** for received goods
    (**credit** the *Stock Input* account [\$80]{.title-ref}).

##### In Odoo

Odoo generates an accounting journal entry when shipments that use
`AVCO (Average Cost Valuation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} costing
method are received. Configure a
`Price Difference Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} by
selecting the `➡️ (arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon next
to the `Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on
the product page.

Under `Account Properties`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, create a
new `Price Difference Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} by
typing in the name of the account and clicking
`Create and Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then set the
account `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
[Expenses]{.title-ref}, and click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Create price difference account.](avg_price_valuation/create-price-difference.png){.align-center}

Then, receive the shipment in the *Purchase* app or *Inventory* app, and
navigate to the
`Accounting app --> Accounting --> Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. In the list, find the
`Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that matches the
warehouse reception operation for the relevant product.

![Show accounting entry of 8 tables from the list.](avg_price_valuation/search-for-entry-of-tables.png){.align-center}

Click on the line for 8 tables. This accounting journal entry shows that
when the 8 tables were received, the [Stock Valuation]{.title-ref}
account increased by [\$80]{.title-ref}. Conversely, the **Stock Input**
account (set as [Stock Interim (Received)]{.title-ref} account by
default) is credited [\$80]{.title-ref}.

![Debit stock valuation and credit stock input 80 dollars.](avg_price_valuation/accounting-entry-8-tables.png){.align-center}

#### Accounts balanced at received vendor bill

In this example, a company starts with zero units of a product, table,
in stock. Then, 8 tables are received from the vendor. When the bill is
received from vendor for 8 tables:

1.  Use [\$80]{.title-ref} in the **Stock Input** account to pay the
    bill. This cancels out and the account now holds [\$0]{.title-ref}.
2.  Debit **Stock Input** [\$80]{.title-ref} (to reconcile this
    account).
3.  Credit **Accounts payable** [\$80]{.title-ref}. This account stores
    the amount the company owes others, so accountants use the amount to
    write checks to vendors.

##### In Odoo

Once the vendor requests payment, navigate to the
`Purchase app --> Orders -->
Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for 8 tables.
Inside the `PO (Purchase
Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, select
`Create Bill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Switch to the `Journal Items`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to
view how [\$80]{.title-ref} is transferred from the holding account,
[Stock Interim (Received)]{.title-ref} to [Accounts
Payable]{.title-ref}. `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the
bill to record the payment to the vendor.

![Show bill linked to the purchase order for 8 tables.](avg_price_valuation/receive-8-table-bill.png){.align-center}

### On product delivery

In the
`above example table <inventory/avg_price/price-table>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, when 10 products are delivered to a customer, the **Stock
Input** account is untouched because there are no new products coming
in. To put it simply:

1.  **Inventory valuation** is credited [\$120]{.title-ref}. Subtracting
    from inventory valuation represents [\$120]{.title-ref} worth of
    products exiting the company.
2.  Debit **Accounts Receivable** to record revenue from the sale.

![Show journal items linked to sale order.](avg_price_valuation/sell-10-tables.png){.align-center}

::: spoiler
Understand Anglo-Saxon expensing

In the accounting journal entry invoicing a customer for 10 tables, the
accounts **Product Sales**, **Tax Received**, and **Accounts
Receivable** all pertain to the sale of the product. **Accounts
Receivable** is the account where the customer payment will be received.

Anglo-Saxon accounting recognizes the cost of goods sold (COGS) once the
sale is made. So, up until the product is sold, scrapped, or returned,
costs of keeping the product in stock are not accounted for. The
**Expense** account is debited [\$120]{.title-ref} to log the costs of
storing 10 tables during this period of time.
:::

### On product return

In the
`above example table <inventory/avg_price/price-table>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, when returning 1 product to a vendor purchased at
[\$10]{.title-ref}, a company expects [\$10]{.title-ref} in the
**Accounts Payable** account from the vendor. However, **Stock Input**
account must be debited [\$12]{.title-ref} because the average cost is
[\$12]{.title-ref} at the time of the return. The missing
[\$2]{.title-ref} is accounted for in the `Price Difference
Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which is set up in the
product\'s `Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Behavior of *price difference accounts* varies from localization. In
this case, the account is intended to store differences between vendor
price and *automated* inventory valuation methods.
::::

Summary:

1.  Debit **Stock Input** account [\$10]{.title-ref} to move the table
    from stock to stock input. This move is to indicate that the table
    is to be processed for an outgoing shipment.
2.  Debit **Stock Input** an additional [\$2]{.title-ref} to account for
    the **Price Difference**.
3.  Credit **Stock Valuation** [\$12]{.title-ref} because the item is
    leaving the stock.

![2 dollar difference expensed in Price Difference account.](avg_price_valuation/expensing-price-difference-account.png){.align-center}

Once the vendor\'s refund is received,

1.  Credit **Stock Input** account [\$10]{.title-ref} to reconcile the
    price of the table.
2.  Debit **Accounts Payable** [\$10]{.title-ref} to have the
    accountants collect and register the payment in their journal.

# Chart of accounts

The **chart of accounts (COA)** is the list of all the accounts used to
record financial transactions in the general ledger of an organization.
The chart of accounts can be found under
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

When browsing your chart of accounts, you can sort the accounts by
`Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Account Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, but other options are
available in the drop-down menu

![Drop-down toggle button](chart_of_accounts/drop-down.png)

![Group the accounts by type in Odoo Accounting](chart_of_accounts/chart-of-accounts-sort.png)

## Configuration of an account {#chart-of-account/create}

The country you select during the creation of your database (or
additional company in your database) determines which
`fiscal localization package <../../fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is installed by default. This package includes a standard
chart of accounts already configured according to the country\'s
regulations. You can use it directly or set it according to your
company\'s needs.

To create a new account, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and fill in (at the minimum) the required fields
(`Code, Account Name, Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

It is not possible to modify the **fiscal localization** of a company
once a journal entry has been posted.

### Code and name

Each account is identified by its `Code`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which
also indicate the account\'s purpose.

### Type {#chart-of-account/type}

Correctly configuring the **account type** is critical as it serves
multiple purposes:

- Information on the account\'s purpose and behavior
- Generate country-specific legal and financial reports
- Set the rules to close a fiscal year
- Generate opening entries

To configure an account type, open the `Type`{.interpreted-text

1.  `No`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this is the default value.
    Nothing happens.
2.  `Create in draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: whenever a
    transaction is posted on the account, a draft entry is created but
    not validated. You must first fill out the corresponding form.
3.  `Create and validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: you must
    also select a `Deferred Expense Model`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}. Whenever a transaction is posted on the account,
    an entry is created and immediately validated.

### Default taxes

In the `View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu of an account,
select a **default tax** to be applied when this account is chosen for a
product sale or purchase.

### Tags {#chart-of-account/tags}

Some accounting reports require **tags** to be set on the relevant
accounts. To add a tag, under `View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
click the `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field and select an
existing tag or `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} a new one.

### Account groups

**Account groups** are useful to list multiple accounts as
*sub-accounts* of a bigger account and thus consolidate reports such as
the **Trial Balance**. By default, groups are handled automatically
based on the code of the group. For example, a new account
[131200]{.title-ref} is going to be part of the group
[131000]{.title-ref}. You can attribute a specific group to an account
in the `Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field under
`View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

#### Create account groups manually

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Regular users should not need to create account groups manually. The
following section is only intended for rare and advanced use cases.
::::

To create a new account group, activate
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and head
to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Account Groups`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Here, create a new group and enter the
`name, code prefix, and company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
which that group account should be available. Note that you must enter
the same code prefix in both `From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields.

![Account groups creation.](chart_of_accounts/account-groups.png)

To display your **Trial Balance** report with your account groups, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Trial Balance`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then open the `Options`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} menu and select
`Hierarchy and Subtotals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Account Groups in the Trial Balance in Odoo Accounting](chart_of_accounts/chart-of-accounts-groups.png)

### Allow reconciliation

To keep the reconciliation process simple, when reconciling a bank,
cash, or credit card transaction with an existing journal item, only
journal items that debit or credit accounts with the
`Allow reconciliation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option enabled
are displayed as possible matches.

To enable this option on an account, tick the
`Allow Reconciliation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox in
the account\'s settings, and `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
or enable the button from the chart of accounts view.

### Shared Accounts {#coa_shared_accounts}

The **Shared Accounts** feature allows the creation of a single account
for a specific purpose and sharing it between multiple companies. It is
especially useful for multi-company environments where a similar account
might be used across different companies.

### Deprecated

It is not possible to delete an account once a transaction has been
recorded on it. You can make them unusable by using the **Deprecated**
feature: check the `Deprecated`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box
in the account\'s settings, and `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

What is owned (an asset) has been financed through debts to reimburse

A difference is made between **assets** and **expenses**:

:   - An **asset** is a resource with economic value that an individual,
      corporation, or country owns or controls with the expectation that
      it will provide a future benefit. Assets are reported on a
      company\'s balance sheet. They are bought or created to increase a
      firm\'s value or benefit its operations.
    - An **expense** is the costs of operations a company bears to
      generate revenues.

## Chart of accounts

The **chart of accounts** lists all the company\'s accounts: both
Balance sheet accounts and P&L accounts. Every transaction is recorded
by debiting and crediting multiple accounts in a journal entry. In a
way, a chart of accounts is like a company\'s DNA!

Every account listed in the chart of accounts belongs to a specific
category. In Odoo, each account has a unique code and belongs to one of
these categories:

- 

  **Equity and subordinated debts**

  :   - **Equity** is the amount of money invested by a company\'s
        shareholders to finance the company\'s activities.
      - **Subordinated debts** are the amount of money lent by a third
        party to a company to finance its activities. In the event of
        the dissolution of a company, these third parties are reimbursed
        before the shareholders.

- **Fixed assets** are tangible (i.e., physical) items or properties
  that a company purchases and uses to produce its goods and services.
  Fixed assets are long-term assets. This means the assets have a useful
  life of more than one year. They also include properties, plants, and
  equipments (also known as \"PP&E\") and are recorded on the balance
  sheet with that classification.

- 

  **Current assets and liabilities**

  :   - The **current assets** account is a balance sheet line item
        listed under the Assets section, which accounts for all
        company-owned assets that can be converted to cash within one
        year. Current assets include cash, cash equivalents, accounts
        receivable, stock inventory, marketable securities, prepaid
        liabilities, and other liquid assets.
      - **Current liabilities** are a company\'s short-term financial
        obligations due within one year. An example of a current
        liability is money owed to suppliers in the form of accounts
        payable.

- 

  **Bank and cash accounts**

  :   - A **bank account** is a financial account maintained by a bank
        or other financial institution in which the financial
        transactions between the bank and a customer are recorded.
      - A **cash account**, or cash book, may refer to a ledger in which
        all cash transactions are recorded. The cash account includes
        both the cash receipts and the cash payment journals.

- 

  **Expenses and income**

  :   - An **expense** is the costs of operations a company bears to
        generate revenues. It is simply defined as the cost one is
        required to spend on obtaining something. Common expenses
        include supplier payments, employee wages, factory leases, and
        equipment depreciation.
      - The term \"\*\*income\*\*\" generally refers to the amount of
        money, property, and other transfers of value received over a
        set period of time in exchange for services or products.

### Example

> \*: Customer Refund and Customer Payment boxes cannot be
> simultaneously selected as they are contradictory.

> >

> > 

## Journal entries {#cheat_sheet/journals}

Every financial document of the company (e.g., an invoice, a bank
statement, a pay slip, a capital increase contract) is recorded as a
journal entry, impacting several accounts.

For a journal entry to be balanced, the sum of all its debits must be
equal to the sum of all its credits.

> examples of accounting entries for various transactions. (see
> entries.js)

## Reconciliation {#accounting/reconciliation}

`Reconciliation <../../accounting/bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is the process of linking journal items of a specific
account and matching credits and debits.

Its primary purpose is to link payments to their related invoices to
mark them as paid. This is done by doing a reconciliation on the
accounts receivable account and/or the accounts payable account.

Reconciliation is performed automatically by the system when:

- the payment is registered directly on the invoice
- the links between the payments and the invoices are detected at the
  bank matching process

## Bank Reconciliation

Bank reconciliation is the matching of bank statement lines (provided by
your bank) with transactions recorded internally (payments to suppliers
or from customers). For each line in a bank statement, it can be:

- **matched with a previously recorded payment**: a payment is
  registered when a check is received from a customer, then matched when
  checking the bank statement.
- **recorded as a new payment**: the payment\'s journal entry is created
  and reconciled with the related invoice when processing the bank
  statement.
- **recorded as another transaction**: bank transfer, direct charge,
  etc.

Odoo should automatically reconcile most transactions; only a few should
need manual review. When the bank reconciliation process is finished,
the balance on the bank account in Odoo should match the bank
statement\'s balance.

::: rst-class

:::

## Checks Handling

There are two approaches to managing checks and internal wire transfers:

- Two journal entries and a reconciliation
- One journal entry and a bank reconciliation

# Consolidation

Consolidation allows combining financial data from **multiple separate
companies**, each with its own books, into a unified view, providing a
\"fair image\" of the entire group\'s financial health.

It helps create a clear, comprehensive view of the group\'s financial
performance by combining data from multiple companies.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Consolidating companies involves **legally separate entities**, whereas
`branches
<general/branches>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are **subdivisions**
of a single legal entity which often share the head office\'s resources
(journals, taxes, accounts, fiscal positions) and are not consolidated
in the same way.
::::

## Consolidation tools {#consolidation_tools}

**Several tools** combined together will contribute to the construction
of the financial consolidation:

::: {#consolidation_account_mapping}
1.  **Account Mapping:** Similar accounts from different companies can
    be mapped together. This allows Odoo to combine them correctly in
    consolidated reports. To map accounts, go to
    `Accounting --> Configuration --> Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}. Click `View`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} on the account line. In the
    `Mapping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, enter a code in
    the corresponding company `Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    column to map the account.

    ![Mapping different codes to different companies.](consolidation/multi_company_mapping.png)

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    `Import mapping <consolidation_import_account_mapping>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} or merge existing accounts using the
    `merging tool <consolidation_merge_tool>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} can simplify the process.
    ::::

    When multiple accounts from one company are mapped to a single
    account in another, it is then possible to group the multiple
    accounts into a single line in the other company\'s reporting by
    `grouping by <customize-reports/lines-group-by>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} the *account code* ([account_code]{.title-ref}) rather
    than the *account ID* ([account_id]{.title-ref}).

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    Some reports, such as the
    `profit and loss <accounting/reporting/profit-and-loss>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, split the lines into different sections by account
    type. When these reports are grouped by account code, the section
    splits are maintained, but within each section, line grouping by
    account code is respected.
    ::::

    ::: example
    Belgian Company is a parent company with a subsidiary, American
    Company. American Company has five income accounts:

    - 400000 Product Sales - Domestic
    - 400100 Product Sales - International
    - 410000 Service Revenue - Consulting
    - 420000 Subscription Revenue
    - 430000 Freight & Handling Revenue

    All five of the US income accounts correspond to one single income
    account (700000 Income) in the Belgian Company.

    For the Belgian Company\'s profit and loss report to show one line
    for all of the American Company\'s combined income accounts related
    to the Belgian Company\'s single income account, all five income
    accounts from the American Company must be mapped to The Belgian
    Company\'s 700000 Income account, and the report\'s lines must be
    `grouped by
    <customize-reports/lines-group-by>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    the account code.
    :::

2.  **Multi-Ledgers:** Ledgers are fundamental to the process of
    consolidation. They are either:

    - *Regular Ledgers:* Each company in the consolidation scope has its
      own standard accounting ledger where all the regular day-to-day
      transactions are recorded. It excludes the company\'s
      consolidation adjustment journals.
    - *Multi-Ledger for Consolidation:* The company doing the actual
      consolidation also has a special multi-ledger. This one includes
      all the other companies\' consolidation adjustments journals (the
      ones excluded from their own ledgers). This allows for viewing the
      total impact of all the adjustments.

    To create a new ledger, go to
    `Accounting --> Configuration --> Multi-Ledgers`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and hit the `New`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} button. Enter a name, pick the company the ledger
    is linked to and most importantly, determine which journals are to
    be excluded from the ledger.

3.  

    **Multi-Company Selector:** The consolidated view can be accessed using the multi-company

    :   selector. Selecting the consolidating company as the current
        company and making the other companies visible in the selector,
        all the journal items are displayed from the consolidating
        company\'s perspective.

    ![Selecting the main company and activating others.](consolidation/multi_company_selector.png)

4.  

    **Horizontal Groups:** Odoo\'s reporting tools allow for combining multi-ledgers and using

    :   horizontal groups to view the consolidated Balance Sheet or P&L.
        They also show how much each company contributes to the overall
        consolidated figures.

        Follow these steps to create an
        `Horizontal Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:

        - Activate the
          `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text
          role="ref"}.
        - Go to
          `Accounting --> Configuration --> Horizontal Groups`{.interpreted-text
          role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text
          role="guilabel"}.
        - Add a `Group Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
          select the `Reports`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} where
          the horizontal group can be used.
        - In the `Field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column,
          click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
        - In the `Create rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
          window, add a `Field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
          create a new `Domain`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} rule
          if needed. Then, click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text
          role="guilabel"}.

    ![Using horizontal groups to see each company\'s contribution.](consolidation/horizontal_groups.png)

    :::: important
    ::: title
    Important
    :::

    When opened, financial reports usually default to a statutory view,
    using the company\'s regular ledger (including its consolidation
    adjustment). To see the full consolidation picture, **make sure to
    select the multi-ledger** that includes all the consolidation
    adjustments.
    ::::

5.  **Cumulative Translation Adjustments:** When consolidating companies
    with different currencies, Odoo handles the translation.

    - *Equity accounts:* Use the historical exchange rate.
    - *Profit & Loss (P&L) accounts:* Use the average exchange rate.
    - *Balance sheet accounts (excluding equity):* Use the closing
      exchange rate.

    :::: important
    ::: title
    Important
    :::

    The rates used are those of the company currently selected.
    ::::
:::

## Account merging {#consolidation_merge_tool}

Accounts can be merged to reduce the number of accounts and standardize
them across companies. This is optional; consolidation works without it.

To use the merge tool, select all the companies with an account that
needs to be merged in the company selector in the top right corner of
the screen.

![Selecting all companies that have accounts to be merged.](consolidation/shared_accounts_merge_tool_select_companies.png)

Then, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the accounts to merge. Click the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} menu and select `Merge
accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In the `Merge accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window,
enable the `Group by name?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option if
needed and click `Merge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The selected accounts are then merged into a single shared account,
accessible by all the chosen companies, just as if the account had been
directly created to be shared.

## Account unmerging {#consolidation_unmerge_tool}

Accounts can also be unmerged if needed.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Note that unmerging accounts **will not unmerge the chatters** of the
accounts. Once merged, the changes\' histories are permanently merged.
::::

To unmerge accounts, select a company with a shared account in the
company selector at the top right corner of the screen. Then, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Chart of
Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select the account
to unmerge. Click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu and select
`Unmerge accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

An `Odoo Warning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} confirmation pop-up
window will appear, listing how the accounts will be split.

![Confirmation wizard for the Unmerge Tool of the shared accounts feature.](consolidation/shared_accounts_unmerge_tool_confirmation_wizard.png)

Click `Unmerge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. A new account linked
to each company will be created for the previously shared account.

## Import a mapping {#consolidation_import_account_mapping}

To **import an account mapping**, select all the related companies in
the company selector at the top right corner of the screen and go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Chart of
Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

First, to choose the fields to export, select the accounts, click the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button and select `Export`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, in the `Export data`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} window, add the `Code mapping/Code`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Code Mapping/Company`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `External ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
fields using the `fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} icon and click
`Export`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. No other field is required.

Second, rework it in a spreadsheet adding the desired code for each
company on desired accounts.

Third, to reimport the file (xlsx or csv format) in Odoo, click
`Import`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and, in the
`Import Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
click `Import CoA`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In the
`Accounting Import Guide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, drop or
click `Upload Data File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to import
the file. Then, click `Import`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Finally, the codes now take into account the mapping company per
company.

# Journals

Journal entries are recorded in different **journals** to maintain an
organized record of a company\'s financial transactions. Odoo uses six
different types of journals to organize accounting records:

- `Bank <accounting/journals/bank>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
- `Cash <accounting/journals/cash>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
- `Credit Card <accounting/journals/credit>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Sales <accounting/journals/sales>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
- `Purchase <accounting/journals/purchase>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Miscellaneous <accounting/journals/misc>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It is possible to have multiple journals of the same type, such as two
separate bank journals, each for a unique bank account, or two separate
sales journals to track `B2B (business to
business)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} versus
`B2C (business to customer)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} income.
::::

Each card on the `Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} represents a journal. To edit the configuration of a
journal, click the `fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(vertical ellipsis)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the journal
card, then click `Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Alternatively, go to `Accounting --> Configuration
--> Journals`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} to select and edit
an existing journal or to create a new one.

While different journal types have slightly different fields to
configure, some fields are consistent across all the journal types:

- `Short Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Each journal must
  have a unique code (from 1 to 5 characters long). The short code is
  used as the prefix for all journal entries belonging to this journal.
- `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If desired, set the
  currency of this journal. For bank and cash journals, this is the
  currency of the journal\'s
  `transactions <../bank/transactions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
  This field is only visible when
  `multiple currencies <multi_currency>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
  are enabled.

The `Advanced Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab contains
more technical options:

- `Allowed accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Limit which
  accounts are available when recording journal entries in this journal.
  Leave this field blank to allow all accounts.
- `Email Alias`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Set an email address
  to create journal entries by digitizing PDFs sent to this address.
  This is most commonly used to create
  `customer invoices and vendor bills
  <accounting/bill-digitization/email-alias>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- `Secure Posted Entries with Hash`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  Restrict the `alterability
  <../reporting/data_inalterability>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} of
  this journal\'s entries to comply with tax authorities in certain
  countries.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

The `Secure Posted Entries with Hash`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option cannot be removed from a journal once the journal has a posted
journal entry.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Bank and cash journals do not have the
`Secure Posted Entries with Hash`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Email Alias`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields. - If an
`alias domain <email-inbound-custom-domain>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} has not yet been configured, a link to
`fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Configure Alias Domain`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is displayed
instead of the `Email Alias`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
::::

## Bank, cash, and credit card journals {#accounting/journals/bank-cash-cc}

Bank, cash, and credit card journals share the following features:

- `Suspense Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `../bank/transactions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} on this journal
  are posted on this account until they are reconciled, at which point
  this account is replaced with the account the transaction was
  reconciled against. At any moment, the suspense account\'s balance in
  the general ledger shows the balance of transactions that have not yet
  been reconciled.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  When a bank transaction is reconciled, the journal entry is modified
  to replace the bank suspense account with the account of the journal
  item it is reconciled with. This account is usually either:

  - the `outstanding receipts or payments account
    <accounting/journals/outstanding-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} if reconciling with a registered payment; or
  - the account receivable or payable if reconciling with an invoice or
    bill directly.
  ::::

- `Dedicated Payment Sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick
  this field to use separate sequences for payments and transactions
  posted on this journal.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  If the `Dedicated Payment Sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  field is ticked, payments that use an
  `outstanding account <accounting/journals/outstanding-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} will have references that add `P`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} before the journal\'s short code. Otherwise, the
  references will begin with `PAY`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  ::::

The `Incoming Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Outgoing Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tabs contain the
`payment
methods <accounting/payments/payment-methods>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} of this journal. Different payment methods are available
depending on the journal type. If desired, set `outstanding accounts
<accounting/journals/outstanding-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} on the payment methods.

configuration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVhhXw-VnGE)
:::

### Outstanding accounts {#accounting/journals/outstanding-accounts}

By default, payments in Odoo do not create journal entries, but they can
be configured to create journal entries by using **outstanding
accounts** on `bank <accounting/journals/bank>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `cash <accounting/journals/cash>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} journals.

- An **outstanding receipts account** is where incoming payments are
  posted until they are linked with incoming bank transactions.
- An **outstanding payments account** is where outgoing payments are
  posted until they are linked with outgoing bank transactions.

These accounts are usually of
`type <chart-of-account/type>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
`Current Assets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Current Liabilities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Payments that are registered in Odoo are posted to the outstanding
receipts and outstanding payments accounts until they are reconciled. At
any moment, the outstanding receipts account\'s balance in the general
ledger shows the balance of registered incoming payments that have not
yet been reconciled, and the outstanding payments account\'s balance in
the general ledger shows the balance of registered outgoing payments
that have not yet been reconciled.

#### Configuration

To configure outstanding accounts, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select or create a bank or cash journal. In
the `Incoming Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Outgoing Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tabs, set
`Outstanding Receipts accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Outstanding Payments accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
each payment method that you want to create journal entries.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- If the main bank account of the journal is added as an outstanding
receipts account or outstanding payments account, when a payment is
registered, the invoice or bill\'s status is directly set to
`Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. - If the outstanding receipts
or outstanding payments account for a payment method is left blank,
registering a payment with that payment method will not create any
journal entry.
::::

### Bank {#accounting/journals/bank}

Bank journals are used to record journal entries related to
`bank transactions
<../bank/transactions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and incoming and
outgoing `payments <../payments>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. The
following fields are specific to bank journals:

- `Bank Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This
  `Bank and Cash`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} type account is the
  default account for this bank journal.
- `Account Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The bank
  account\'s number is used when registering payments and is required
  for generating outgoing payment files, such as
  `SEPA <../payments/pay_sepa>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} or
  `NACHA <l10n_us/nacha>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. To edit the
  bank account details, click on the `oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} `(Internal link)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  button next to the `Account Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  and update the account information accordingly.
- `Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The bank name is used when
  registering payments and is required for generating outgoing payment
  files. To edit the bank account details, click on the
  `oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(Internal link)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to
  the `Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} name and update the
  account information accordingly.
- `Bank Feeds`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Define the method of
  creating bank `transactions
  <../bank/transactions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, whether
  `Manual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or via
  `Online Synchronization
  <../bank/bank_synchronization>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
- `Split Transactions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Split
  collective payments for CODA files.

Multiple payment methods are available for bank journals, as are
configurations for generating outgoing payment files, such as
`SEPA <../payments/pay_sepa>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} or
`NACHA <l10n_us/nacha>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

### Cash {#accounting/journals/cash}

Cash journals are used to record journal entries related to cash
`transactions
<../bank/transactions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. The following
fields are specific to cash journals:

- `Cash Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This
  `Bank and Cash`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} type account is the
  default account for this cash journal.
- `Profit Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This
  `Income`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Other Income`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} type account is used
  to register a profit when the ending balance of a cash register is
  greater than expected.
- `Loss Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This
  `Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} type account is used to
  register a loss when the ending balance of a cash register is less
  than expected.

Only manual payment methods are available for cash journals.

### Credit card {#accounting/journals/credit}

Credit card journals are used to record journal entries related to
credit cards. The following fields are specific to credit card journals:

- `Journal Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This
  `Credit Card`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} type account is the
  default account for this credit card journal.
- `Bank Feeds`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Define the method of
  creating credit card transactions, whether manual or via
  `Online Synchronization <../bank/bank_synchronization>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.

Only manual payment methods are available for credit card journals.

## Sales, purchase, and miscellaneous journals {#accounting/journals/sales-purchase-misc}

### Sales {#accounting/journals/sales}

Sales journals, also known as income journals, are used to record
journal entries related to
`customer invoices <../customer_invoices>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. The following fields are specific to customer invoice
journals:

- `Default Income Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Invoices
  in this journal use this `Income`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  or `Other Income`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} type account
  unless overwritten by another income account set on the product
  category, product, or invoice line itself.
- `Dedicated Credit Note Sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  Check this box to use a separate sequence for the reference of credit
  notes that increments separately from the main invoice sequence and
  adds an [R]{.title-ref} to the reference before the journal\'s short
  code.
- `Dedicated Debit Note Sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  Check this box to use a separate sequence for the reference of credit
  notes that increments separately from the main invoice sequence and
  adds a [D]{.title-ref} before the journal\'s short code.

Sales journals have additional fields in the
`Advanced Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab that allow
you to set the default communication format that will appear on customer
invoices so that the customer can refer to that particular invoice when
making a payment:

- `Communication Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Choose if the
  format of the payment reference communicated to the customer should be
  based on the invoice number or the customer\'s number.
- `Communication Standard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Choose
  the format of the payment reference itself that is communicated to the
  customer.

### Purchase {#accounting/journals/purchase}

Purchase journals are used to record journal entries related to
`vendor bills
<../vendor_bills>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. The following fields
are specific to purchase journals:

  bills in this journal use this `Expense`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} type account unless overwritten by another expense
  account set on the product category, product, or expense.
- `Private Part Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  account to be used to register the private part of mixed expenses.
- `Dedicated Credit Note Sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  Check this box to use a separate sequence for the reference of credit
  notes that increments separately from the main vendor bill sequence
  and adds an [R]{.title-ref} to the reference before the journal\'s
  short code.
- `Dedicated Debit Note Sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  Check this box to use a separate sequence for the reference of credit
  notes that increments separately from the main invoice sequence and
  adds a [D]{.title-ref} before the journal\'s short code.

### Miscellaneous {#accounting/journals/misc}

Miscellaneous journals are used to record journal entries that are not
related to any of the other journal types such as tax closing journal
entries.

# Multi-currency system

Odoo allows you to issue invoices, receive bills, and record
transactions in currencies other than the main currency configured for
your company. You can also set up bank accounts in other currencies and
run reports on your foreign currency activities.

::: seealso
\- `../bank/foreign_currency`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Configuration {#multi-currency/config}

### Main currency {#multi-currency/config-main-currency}

The **main currency** is defined by default according to the company\'s
country. You can change it by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and changing the currency in the
`Main Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting.

### Enable foreign currencies {#multi-currency/config-enable}

Go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and enable the currencies you wish to use by
toggling the `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![Enable the currencies you wish to use.](multi_currency/enable-foreign-currencies.png){.align-center}

### Currency rates {#multi-currency/config-rates}

#### Manual update {#multi-currency/manual-update}

To manually create and set a currency rate, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Currencies`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, click on the
currency you wish to change the rate of, and under the
`Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a new rate.

![Create or modify the currency rate.](multi_currency/manual-rate-update.png){.align-center}

#### Automatic update {#multi-currency/automatic-update}

When you activate a second currency for the first time,
`Automatic Currency Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears
under
`Accounting Dashboard --> Configuration --> Settings --> Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. By default, you have to click on the **Update
now** button (`🗘`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) to update the
rates.

Odoo can update the rates at regular intervals. To do so, change the
`Interval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from
`Manually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Daily`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Weekly`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. You
can also select the web service from which you want to retrieve the
latest currency rates by clicking on the `Service`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

### Exchange difference entries {#multi-currency/config-exch-diff}

Odoo automatically records exchange differences entries on dedicated
accounts, in a dedicated journal.

You can define which journal and accounts to use to **post exchange
difference entries** by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Default Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and editing the `Journal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Gain Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Loss Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: example
If you receive a payment for a customer invoice one month after it was
issued, the exchange rate has likely changed since. Therefore, this
fluctuation implies some profit or loss due to the exchange difference,
which Odoo automatically records in the default **Exchange Difference**
journal.
:::

### Chart of accounts {#multi-currency/config-coa}

Each account can have a set currency. By doing so, all moves relevant to
the account are forced to have that account\'s currency.

To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Charts of Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select a currency in the field
`Account Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If left empty,
all active currencies are handled instead of just one.

### Journals {#multi-currency/config-journals}

If a currency is set on a **journal**, that journal only handles
transactions in that currency.

To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, open the journal you want to edit, and select a
currency in the field `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Select the currency for the journal to handle.](multi_currency/journal-currency.png){.align-center}

## Multi-currency accounting {#multi-currency/mca}

### Invoices, bills, and other documents {#multi-currency/mca-documents}

For all documents, you can select the currency and journal to use for
the transaction on the document itself.

![Select the currency and journal to use.](multi_currency/currency-field.png){.align-center}

### Payment registration {#multi-currency/mca-payment}

To register a payment in a currency other than your company\'s main
currency, click on the `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} payment button of your document and, in the pop-up
window, select a **currency** in the `Amount`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

![Select the currency and journal to use before registering the payment.](multi_currency/register-payment.png){.align-center}

### Bank transactions {#multi-currency/mca-statements}

When creating or importing bank transactions, the amount is in the
company\'s main currency. To input a **foreign currency**, select a
currency in the `Foreign Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Once selected, enter the `Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
your main currency for it to automatically get converted in the foreign
currency in the `Amount in Currency field`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![The extra fields related to foreign currencies.](multi_currency/foreign-fields.png){.align-center}

When reconciling, Odoo displays both the foreign currency amount and the
equivalent amount in your company\'s main currency.

### Exchange rate journal entries {#multi-currency/mca-exch-entries}

To see **exchange difference journal entries**, go to
`Accounting Dashboard -->
Accounting --> Journals: Miscellaneous`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![Exchange rate journal entry.](multi_currency/exchange-journal-currency.png){.align-center}

# Tax units

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

This is only applicable to multi-company environments.
::::

A **tax unit** is a group of VAT-taxable enterprises that are legally
independent of each other but are closely linked financially,
organizationally, and economically and therefore considered the same
VAT-taxable enterprise. **Tax units** are not mandatory, but if created,
constituent companies of the unit must belong to the same **country**,
use the same **currency**, and one company must be designated as the
**representative** company of the **tax unit**. **Tax units** receive a
specific **tax ID** intended only for **tax returns**. **Constituent**
companies keep their **tax ID** used for **commercial purposes**.

::: example
Enterprise **A** owes €300.000,00 of VAT taxes and enterprise **B** can
recover €280.000,00 of VAT taxes. They form up as a **tax unit** so that
the two amounts balance out and must conjointly only pay €20.000,00 of
VAT taxes.
:::

## Configuration

To create a **tax unit**, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Tax Units`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Enter a **name** for the unit, select a
`Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Companies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to incorporate in the
unit, the `Main Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the **constituent**
company of that tax unit.

### Fiscal position

As transactions between constituents of the same **tax unit** are not
subject to VAT, it is possible to create a
`tax mapping (fiscal position) <../taxes/fiscal_positions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to avoid the application of VAT on inter-constituent
transactions.

Be sure a constituent company has been selected before, then go to
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Fiscal Positions`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} a
new **fiscal position**. Click the `Tax Mapping`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, select the `Tax on Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} usually applied for **non-constituent** transactions,
and in `Tax to Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select the 0%
tax to apply for **constituent** transactions.

Do the same for the `Account Mapping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab if required, and repeat this process for **each** constituent
company on your database.

::: example
Depending on your
`localization package </applications/finance/fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, taxes may vary from the screenshot displayed.

![Tax mapping of fiscal position for tax unit](tax_units/fiscal-positions.png)
:::

Then, assign the fiscal position by opening the **Contacts** app. Search
for a **constituent** company, and open the contact\'s **card**. Click
the `Sales & Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and in
the `Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, input
the **fiscal position** created for the **tax unit**. Repeat the process
for each **constituent** company card form, on each company database.

::: seealso
`../taxes/fiscal_positions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
:::

## Tax report

The **representative** company can access the aggregated tax report of
the **tax unit** by going to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and selecting the **tax unit** in
`Tax Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This report contains the
aggregated transactions of all **constituents** and the .XML export
contains the name and VAT number of the **main** company.

# Get started

When you first open your Odoo Accounting app, the
`Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} welcomes you
with a step-by-step onboarding banner, a wizard that helps you get
started. This onboarding banner is displayed until you choose to close
it.

The settings visible in the onboarding banner can still be modified
later by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Odoo Accounting automatically installs the appropriate **Fiscal
Localization Package** for your company, according to the country
selected at the creation of the database. This way, the right accounts,
reports, and taxes are ready-to-go.
`Click here <fiscal_localizations/packages>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for more information about Fiscal Localization Packages.
::::

## Accounting onboarding banner

The step-by-step Accounting onboarding banner is composed of four steps:

![Step-by-step onboarding banner in Odoo Accounting](get_started/accounting-onboarding-banner.png)

1.  `accounting-setup-periods`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
2.  `accounting-setup-bank`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
3.  `accounting-setup-taxes`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
4.  `accounting-setup-chart`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

### Accounting Periods {#accounting-setup-periods}

Define the **Fiscal Years**' opening and closing dates, which are used
to generate reports automatically, and set your **Tax Return
Periodicity**, along with a reminder to never miss a tax return
deadline.

By default, the opening date is set on the 1st of January and the
closing date on the 31st of December, as this is the most common use.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

You can also change these settings by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Settings --> Fiscal Periods`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
updating the values.

  role="guilabel"} (BIC or SWIFT).
- `Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this code is your
  Journal\'s `Short Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, as
  displayed in Odoo. By default, Odoo creates a new Journal with this
  short code.
- `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field is displayed
  if you have an existing bank journal that is not linked yet to a bank
  account. If so, then select the `Journal`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} you want to use to record the financial transactions
  linked to this bank account or create a new one by clicking
  `Create and Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

There is another step-by-step onboarding banner that helps you take
advantage of your Odoo Invoicing and Accounting apps. The Invoicing
onboarding banner is the one that welcomes you if you use the Invoicing
app rather than the Accounting app.

If you have Odoo Accounting installed on your database, you can reach it
by going to `Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

The Invoicing onboarding banner consists of four main steps:

# Batch payments

Batch payments allow grouping payments from multiple customers or
vendors into a single batch and generating a detailed deposit slip or
payment file with a batch reference. This reference can be used during
`reconciliation <../bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
to match bank transactions with the corresponding payments. This feature
is particularly useful for submitting `SEPA Direct Debit
payments <batch_sdd>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, depositing cash
payments or `checks <accounting/payments/checks>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, or generating outgoing payment files, such as
`SEPA <pay_sepa>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} or
`NACHA <l10n_us/nacha>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

## Configuration

To enable batch payments, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, scroll down to the
`Customer Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and
enable `Batch Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Batch creation {#accounting/batch/creation}

To create a batch payment, follow these steps:

1.  Make sure all payments to be included in the batch have been
    `registered
    <accounting/payments/from-invoice-bill>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

2.  Go to `Accounting --> Customers --> Payments`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.

3.  Select the payments to include in the batch.

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    All payments in the batch must use the same payment method. If
    needed, payments can be grouped using the
    `Payment Method Line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
    ::::

4.  Click `Create batch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or click
    `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} and select `Create batch payment`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

5.  In the batch payment form, review the selected payments. If any
    individual payments were missed, click
    `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select the
    missing payments to be included in the batch.

6.  Once all relevant payments are included, click
    `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to finalize the batch.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Once validated, no additional payments can be added to a batch.

### Bank reconciliation

Once the bank transactions
`have been created <../bank/transactions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
in your database, you can
`reconcile <accounting/reconciliation/reconcile>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} them with the batch payment.

# SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) customer payments

SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) is a payment-integration initiative of
the European Union that facilitates standardized and simplified
electronic payments in euros across participating countries. With **SEPA
Direct Debit** (SDD), customers sign a mandate that authorizes you to
collect future payments from their bank accounts. This is particularly
useful for recurring payments based on a
`subscription </applications/sales/subscriptions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

You can record customer `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} mandates in Odoo and generate XML files listing payments to
be collected with the mandates.
`Uploading these files to your bank <accounting/batch_sdd/XML>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} instructs them to collect these payments from your
customers.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is supported
by all SEPA countries, which includes the 27 member states of the
European Union as well as additional countries. - [List of all SEPA
countries](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/document-library/other/epc-list-sepa-scheme-countries).
::::

## Configuration {#accounting/batch_sdd/sepa-configuration}

### Creditor identifier

To enable `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for
customer payments, go to `Accounting --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, scroll to the
`Customer Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, enable
`SEPA Direct Debit
(SDD)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, scroll to the
`Customer Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section again,
set the company\'s `Creditor Identifier`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The creditor identifier is provided by your bank or the authority
responsible for delivering them in your country. For testing purposes,
you can use the test creditor identifier
[DE98ZZZ09999999999]{.title-ref}.
::::

### PAIN file version

By default, the
`SEPA-compliant XML files <accounting/batch_sdd/XML>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} generated by Odoo use the
`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
**PAIN.008.001.02** format. If your bank requires the updated 2023
version, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the `Bank`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} journal. Then, in the
`Incoming Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, set the
`SEPA
Pain version`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
`Updated 2023 (Pain 008.001.08)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## SEPA Direct Debit Mandates {#accounting/batch_sdd/sdd_mandates}

An `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} mandate is a
legal document authorizing a company to debit funds from a customer\'s
bank account. It includes key information, such as the customer\'s name
and IBAN, the mandate\'s start and end date, and the mandate\'s unique
identifier. The mandate form must be filled in and signed by the
customer.

### Creating mandates

To create an `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
mandate:

1.  Go to
    `Accounting --> Customers --> Direct Debit Mandates`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
2.  Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and fill out the
    fields.
3.  Click `Send & Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, optionally
    edit the email, then click `Send & Print`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} to email the mandate form to the customer for
    signature.
4.  Click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to activate the
    mandate.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

A valid IBAN must be defined in the `Account Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field of the `bank journal
<../bank>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} used to receive
`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} payments for
the mandate.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- To print the mandate form after the mandate has been validated, click
the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} (`gear`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}) icon, then select `Mandate form`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. - The `SDD Scheme`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
depends on the type of customer: Select `CORE`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for B2C customers and `B2B`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for B2B customers. -
`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} mandates are
created automatically for `online payments made with SDD
<payment_providers/bank_payments/sdd>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

Once an `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} mandate
is active, subsequent `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} payments can be generated via Odoo and
`uploaded to your online banking interface <accounting/batch_sdd/XML>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Customers with an active
`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} mandate can
also use this payment method for `online purchases
<payment_providers/bank_payments/sdd>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

### Closing or revoking a mandate {#accounting/batch_sdd/close-revoke-mandate}

`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} mandates are
closed automatically after their `End Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. If this field is left empty, the mandate remains
active until it is closed or revoked. To close or revoke a mandate, go
to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Direct Debit Mandates`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select the relevant mandate, and click
`Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Revoke`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

**Closing** a mandate updates the mandate\'s end day to the current day.
Invoices issued after the present day will not be processed with an
`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} payment.
**Revoking** a mandate disables the mandate immediately. No
`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} payment can be
registered anymore, regardless of the invoice\'s date. However, payments
that have already been registered are still included in the next `SDD
XML file <accounting/batch_sdd/XML>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

\- Mandates are automatically closed 36 months after the date of the
last collection. - Closed or revoked mandates cannot be reactivated.
::::

## Processing `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} payments {#accounting/batch_sdd/XML}

All registered `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
payments can be processed at once by uploading an XML file containing a
batch of all posted `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} payments to your online banking interface. To do so, follow
these steps:

1.  `Create a batch payment <accounting/batch/creation>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and include the
    `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} payments to
    collect.

    :::: tip
    ::: title
    Tip
    :::

    You can filter payments by SDD scheme using the
    `SDD CORE`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
    `SDD B2B`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filters.
    ::::

2.  `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the batch payment. The
    XML file is generated automatically and available for download in
    the chatter.

3.  Download the XML file and upload it to your online banking interface
    to process the payments.

4.  Once the `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
    batch payment has been received, `reconcile the transaction
    <../bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} with the
    batch payment to mark the related invoices as
    `Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip

## `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} rejections {#sdd-rejections}

`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} rejections can
occur for several reasons, the most common being insufficient funds in
the customer\'s account. With
`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
recipient\'s account is credited before the funds are actually debited
from the customer\'s account. As a result, if an
`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} payment is
later rejected, the bank automatically withdraws the amount of that
payment from the recipient\'s account, and a new transaction for a
negative amount is created to reflect the
`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} rejection.

`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} rejections are
handled differently depending on whether `outstanding accounts
<accounting/journals/outstanding-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are configured or not for the
`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} payment method.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The following procedures assume that the incoming
`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} payment\'s bank
transaction has already been
`reconciled <accounting/reconciliation/reconcile>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} with the payments or invoices.
::::

::::: tabs
::: tab
Without outstanding accounts

If no
`outstanding accounts <accounting/journals/outstanding-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are configured for the
`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} payment method,
no journal entry is created. In this case, you must cancel and
unreconcile the payment.

1.  Access the invoice linked to the rejected
    `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} payment.
2.  Click the `Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button
    to access the payment associated with the invoice.
3.  Click `Reset to draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then
    `Cancel`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
4.  Go back to the invoice and click the
    `fa-info-circle`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    `(information)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
    footer of the `Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    tab, then click `Unreconcile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
5.  `Access the bank journal's reconciliation view <accounting/reconciliation/access>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and
    `reconcile <accounting/reconciliation/reconcile>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} the transaction created for the
    `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} rejection
    with the debit (negative journal item) to the account receivable on
    the incoming bank transaction.
:::

::: tab
Using outstanding accounts

If an
`outstanding account <accounting/journals/outstanding-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} is set on the `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} payment method, `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} payments create journal entries. If an
`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} payment is
rejected, you must reverse the journal entry associated with the
rejected payment and reconcile the reversal of the journal entry with
the transaction for the `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} rejection. To do so, follow these steps:

1.  Access the invoice linked to the rejected
    `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} payment.
2.  Click the `fa-info-circle`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    `(information)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
    footer of the `Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    tab, then click `View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to access
    the payment associated with the invoice.
3.  Click the `Journal entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
    button to access the related journal entry.
4.  Click `Reverse entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, optionally
    edit the fields in the popup, then click `Reverse`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}. A reversal entry is created with a
    `Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} mentioning the
    initial journal entry. As a result, the invoice is marked as
    `Not paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
5.  `Access the bank journal's reconciliation view <accounting/reconciliation/access>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and
    `reconcile <accounting/reconciliation/reconcile>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} the transaction created for the
    `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} rejection
    with the reversal of the entry related to the payment.

# Forecast future bills to pay

In Odoo, you can manage payments by setting automatic **Payments Terms**
and **follow-ups**.

## Configuration: payment terms

In order to track vendor conditions, we use **Payment Terms** in Odoo.
They allow keeping track of due dates on invoices. Examples of **Payment
Terms** are:

- 50% within 30 days
- 50% within 45 days

To create them, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Invoicing: Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click on `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to add new terms or click existing ones to modify them.

::: seealso
[Odoo Tutorials: Payment
Terms](https://www.odoo.com/slides/slide/payment-terms-terms-and-conditions-6852)
:::

Once **Payment Terms** are defined, you can assign them to your vendor
by default. To do so, go to `Vendors --> Vendors`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select a vendor, click the
`Sales & Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and select a
specific **Payment Term**. This way, every time you purchase from this
vendor, Odoo automatically proposes the chosen Payment Term.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If you do not set a specific Payment Term on a vendor, you can still set
one on the vendor bill.
::::

## Forecast bills to pay with the aged payable report

To track amounts to be paid to the vendors, use the **Aged Payable**
report. To access it, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Partner Reports: Aged Payable`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. This report gives you a summary per vendor of the
amounts to pay, compared to their due date (the due date being computed
on each bill using the terms). This report tells you how much you will
have to pay within the following months.

## Select bills to pay

You can get a list of all your vendor bills by going to
`Vendors --> Bills`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. To view
only the bills that you need to pay, click
`Filters --> Bills to Pay`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. To
view only overdue payments, select the `Overdue`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} filter instead.

You can also group bills by their due date by clicking
`Group By --> Due Date`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
selecting a time period.

# Online payments

To make it more convenient for your customers to pay the invoices you
issue, you can activate the **Invoice Online Payment** feature, which
adds a *Pay Now* button on their **Customer Portal**. This allows your
customers to see their invoices online and pay directly with their
favorite payment method, making the payment process much easier.

![Payment provider choice after having clicked on \"Pay Now\"](online/online-payment-providers.png){.align-center}

## Configuration

Make sure your
`payment providers are correctly configured <../../payment_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

By default,
`Wire Transfer <payment_providers/bank_payments/wire_transfer>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} is the only payment provider activated, but you still have
to fill out the payment details.
::::

To activate the Invoice Online Payment, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Settings --> Customer Payments`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
enable **Invoice Online Payment**, and click on *Save*.

## Customer Portal

After issuing the invoice, click on *Send & Print* and send the invoice
by email to the customer. They will receive an email with a link that
redirects them to the invoice on their **Customer Portal**.

![Email with a link to view the invoice online on the Customer Portal.](online/view-invoice.png)

They can choose which Payment Provider to use by clicking on *Pay Now*.

# Pay by checks

Once you decide to pay a supplier bill, you can select to pay by check.
You can then print all the payments registered by check. Finally, the
bank reconciliation process will match the checks you sent to suppliers
with actual bank statements.

## Configuration

### Activate checks payment methods

To activate the checks payment method, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and scroll down to
the `Vendor Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. There,
you can activate the payment method as well as set up the
`Check Layout`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Once the `Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting is
activated, the **Checks** payment method is automatically set up in the
`Outgoing Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tabs of **bank**
journals. - Some countries require specific modules to print checks;
such modules may be installed by default. For instance, the
`U.S. Checks Layout`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} module is
required to print U.S. checks.
::::

## Compatible check stationery for printing checks

### United States

For the United States, Odoo supports by default the check formats of:

- **Quickbooks & Quicken**: check on top, stubs in the middle and
  bottom;
- **Peachtree**: check in the middle, stubs on top and bottom;
- **ADP**: check in the bottom, and stubs on the top.

## Pay a supplier bill with a check

Paying a supplier with a check is done in three steps:

1.  registering a payment
2.  printing checks in batch for all registered payments
3.  reconciling bank statements

### Register a payment by check

To register a payment, open any supplier bill from the menu
`Purchases --> Vendor
Bills`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Once the supplier bill
is validated, you can register a payment. Set the
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and validate the payment.

### Print checks

On your `Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} Journal, you can see the
number of checks registered. By clicking on
`Checks to print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} you have got the
possibility to print the reconciled checks.

To print all checks in batch, select all payments from the list view and
click on `Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Pay with SEPA

SEPA, the Single Euro Payments Area, is a payment-integration initiative
of the European Union to simplify bank transfers denominated in euros.
SEPA allows you to send payment orders to your bank to automate bank
wire transfers.

SEPA is supported by the banks of the 27 EU member states, as well as:

EFTA countries:

- Iceland;
- Liechtenstein;
- Norway;
- Switzerland.

Non-EEA SEPA countries:

- Andorra;
- Monaco;
- San Marino;
- United Kingdom;
- Vatican City State.

Non-EEA territories:

- Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon;
- Guernsey;
- Jersey;
- Isle of Man.

When paying a bill in Odoo, you can select SEPA mandates as a payment
option. At the end of the day, you can generate the SEPA file containing
all bank wire transfers and upload it to your online banking interface
to process the payments.

By default, the file follows the SEPA Credit Transfer
**\'pain.001.001.03\'** specifications. This is a well-defined standard
among banks. However, for Swiss and German companies, other formats are
used **\'pain.001.001.03.ch.02\'** for Switzerland and
**\'pain.001.003.03\'** for Germany.

Once the payments are processed by your bank, you can directly import
the account statement in Odoo. The bank reconciliation process will
seamlessly match the SEPA orders you sent to your bank with actual bank
statements.

## Configuration

### Activate SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) {#accounting/pay_sepa/activate-sepa}

To pay suppliers with SEPA, you must activate the **SEPA Credit
Transfer** setting. To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Vendor Payments: SEPA Credit Transfer
(SCT)`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. By activating the
setting and filling out your company data, you will be able to use the
SCT option when paying your vendor.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

According to the localization package installed, the **SEPA Direct
Debit** and **SEPA Credit Transfer** modules may be installed by
default. If not, they need to be
`installed <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

### Activate SEPA payment methods on banks {#accounting/pay_sepa/activate-sepa-bank-journal}

From the accounting dashboard, click on the drop-down menu
(`⋮`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) on your bank journal and select
`Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click the
`Outgoing Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and, if not
already present, add `SEPA Credit Transfer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} under `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Make sure to specify the IBAN account number (domestic account numbers
do not work with SEPA) and the BIC (bank identifier code) in the
`Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

### Registering payments {#accounting/pay_sepa/registering-payments-sepa}

You can register any vendor payments made with SEPA. To do so, go to
`Accounting -->
Vendors --> Payments`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. When
creating your payment, select `SEPA Credit Transfer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} as the `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

The first time you pay a vendor with SEPA, you have to fill in the
`Recipient Bank
Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field with the bank name,
IBAN, and BIC (Bank Identifier Code). Odoo automatically verifies if the
IBAN format is respected.

For future payments to this vendor, Odoo will automatically suggest you
the bank account, but it remains possible to select a new one.

Once your payment is registered, do not forget to confirm it. You can
also pay vendor bills from the bill directly using the
`Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top
of a vendor bill. The form is the same, but the payment is directly
linked to the bill and will be automatically reconciled with it.

# Trusted accounts (send money)

To protect users from sending money to scammers, vendor bank account
numbers must be marked as trusted before you can use them to make an
outgoing payment.

To do so, open the vendor bank account and click on the
`Send Money`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} toggle switch button.

![Example of a vendor bank account with the \"Send Money\" toggle button switched to \"trusted.\"](trusted_accounts/send-money-toggle.png){.align-center}

## Phishing attacks

A **phishing attack** is an online scam designed to trick individuals or
companies into giving away sensitive information or money by sending out
fraudulent communication. Fraudsters pretend to be legitimate companies
and may use partial information to give credibility to their requests.

There are several types of phishing attacks, including **invoice
fraud**. In this case, the fraudster pretends to be a genuine supplier
following up on unpaid bills or sending a new invoice, but with
different payment information than usual and with fake contact details.

To protect yourself from these types of phishing attacks, remain
vigilant when you receive unexpected invoices or payment requests.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

In case of doubt, **we recommend contacting the vendor by phone**. Make
sure to call an official phone number by searching yourself, as the
URLs, email addresses, and phone numbers written in the communication
you received may be fake.
::::

### Elements to check

There are several elements you can check by yourself when you receive an
outgoing payment request to a new account:

Communication style

:   Fraudulent emails and invoices often use a different communication
    style, such as **different wording**, and may include **spelling and
    grammatical mistakes**. Examine and **compare** them with previous
    ones that you know to be authentic (e.g., payment instructions,
    language, company logo, etc.).\*

Urgency

:   Invoice frauds often use **urgent or threatening language** and
    change the **payment deadline**. Check if you really received a late
    payment reminder previously.

Type of account

:   A company is unlikely to replace a bank account with a **money
    transfer service**.

Email and links domain names

:   Double-check the **email address domain**
    ([example@domain.com]{.title-ref}). However, be wary that fraudsters
    can make their email addresses look genuine or even hack email
    addresses from your vendor\'s employees or even someone within your
    own organization.

    Hover over the links in your email and check that the URLs they
    redirect to are genuine. Your internet browser usually displays the
    link\'s target at the bottom left of the window.

# Payments

In Odoo, payments can either be automatically linked to an invoice or
bill or be stand-alone records for use at a later date:

- If a payment is **linked to an invoice or bill**, it reduces/settles
  the amount due on the invoice. Multiple payments on the same invoice
  are possible.
- If a payment is **not linked to an invoice or bill**, the customer has
  an outstanding credit with the company, or the company has an
  outstanding debit with a vendor. Those outstanding amounts
  reduce/settle unpaid invoices/bills.

:::

## Payment methods {#accounting/payments/payment-methods}

Several payment methods are available in Odoo to allow different
configurations for different types of payments. Examples of payment
methods include manual payments (such as cash), `checks
<payments/pay_checks>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, and batch payment
files (such as `NACHA
<l10n_us/ach-electronic-transfers>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`SEPA <payments/pay_sepa>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}). Payment
methods can be configured in the `Incoming Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Outgoing Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tabs of a bank or cash journal.

::: seealso
`../../sales/point_of_sale/payment_methods`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for Point of Sale
:::

### Preferred payment method {#accounting/payments/preferred-payment-methods}

A contact\'s preferred payment method can be set so that when a payment
is created for that contact, the payment method is automatically
selected by default. Invoices and bills can be filtered by
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to simplify
`group <accounting/payments/group-payments>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} payments.

To set a preferred `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
for a customer or a vendor, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Customers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} or `Accounting --> Vendors
--> Vendors`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select the
customer or vendor. In the `Sales & Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of the contact form, select the preferred
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section for invoice payments
or for vendor bill payments in the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section.

Access a full list of all contacts from the
`Customers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Vendors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list view by removing the
`Customers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Vendors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter. Alternatively,
access the full contact list through the Contacts app.
::::

### Checks {#accounting/payments/checks}

`Vendor bills can be paid by check <payments/pay_checks>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} using a dedicated outgoing payment method, which allows
check numbers to be tracked and checks to be printed directly from Odoo.

For incoming customer check payments, you can use the default
`Manual Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} payment method, or
you can create a payment method specifically for checks to help identify
such payments quickly. To create a *Check* payment method, follow these
steps:

1.  Go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and select the `Bank`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} journal.
2.  In the `Incoming Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
    click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
3.  As `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select
    `Manual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then enter
    [Check]{.title-ref} as the `Name`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

When registering a customer payment
`on an invoice <accounting/payments/from-invoice-bill>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or
`not related to an invoice <accounting/payments/not-tied>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, use the new `Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
payment method.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Registering a customer payment by check in Odoo does not move funds.
Checks must be deposited in order to make the payment. Once deposited to
your bank, the check should appear as a `bank
transaction <bank/transactions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, at which
point it can be `reconciled
<bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} with the registered
payment.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- For best practice, enter the check number as the
`Memo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} when registering a customer
payment by check. - `Batch payments <payments/batch>`{.interpreted-text

checks.
::::

## Registering payment from an invoice or bill[]{#accounting/payments/from-invoice-bill} {#finance/accounting/register-payment-invoice-bill}

To register a payment for an invoice or a bill, follow these steps:

1.  Click `Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on a customer invoice
    or vendor bill. In the `Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    window, select the `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
    the `Payment Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
2.  If previously set, the contact\'s preferred
    `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is automatically
    selected by default but can be updated if necessary.
3.  If using
    `payment terms <customer_invoices/payment_terms>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}, the `Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
    automatically set based on the installment amounts defined by the
    payment term. To pay the full amount instead, click
    `full amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
4.  If necessary, edit the `Memo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
5.  Click `Create Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

After the payment is registered, the customer invoice or vendor bill is
marked as `In payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::::::::::: tabs
::::: group-tab
Without outstanding accounts

If no
`outstanding accounts <accounting/journals/outstanding-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are configured, no journal entry is created. To display more
information about the payment, click the `Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button.

When the invoice or vendor bill is
`reconciled <bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} with a
bank transaction, its status is updated to `Paid`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: note

Using outstanding accounts

By default, payments in Odoo do not create journal entries, but they can
easily be configured to create journal entries using
`outstanding accounts
<accounting/journals/outstanding-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Registering a payment on a customer invoice or vendor bill generates a
new journal entry and reduces the `Amount Due`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} based on the payment amount. The counterpart is
reflected in an
`outstanding <accounting/journals/outstanding-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **receipts** or **payments** account. At this point, the
customer invoice or vendor bill is marked as
`In payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, when the payment
is `reconciled <bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} with
a bank transaction, the invoice or vendor bill status changes to
`Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The `fa-info-circle`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} information icon
next to the payment line displays more information about the payment. To
access additional information, such as the related journal, click
`View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![See detailed information of a payment.](payments/information-icon.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Unreconciling a payment unlinks it from the invoice or bill but does
not delete the payment. - If a payment is (un)reconciled in a different
currency, a journal entry is automatically created to post the currency
exchange gains/losses (reversal) amount. - If a payment is
(un)reconciled on an invoice with cash-basis taxes, a journal entry is
automatically created to post the cash-basis tax (reversal) amount.

# Analytic accounting

Analytic accounting helps track costs and revenues and analyze a
project\'s or service\'s profitability. When creating journal entries,
costs can be `distributed
<accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic-distribution>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} across one or more analytic accounts.

To activate this feature, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and enable `Analytic Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `Analytics`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section.

::: seealso
`Analytic budget <budget>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Analytic accounts {#accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic_accounts}

Analytic accounts give an overview of costs and revenue.

To access analytic accounts, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Analytic
Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. To create a new
analytic account, click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
fill in the following information:

- `Analytic Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Assign the name
  of the analytic account.
- `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the customer
  linked to the project, if applicable.
- `Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Include a reference to
  make the account easier to find if needed.
- `Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Link the
  `Analytic Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to an
  `analytic plan
  <accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic_plans>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: In a
  `multi-company </applications/general/companies/multi_company>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} environment, select the company using the analytic
  account. To make the analytic account accessible to all companies,
  leave the field empty.
- `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Update the currency of
  the analytic account if needed.

Then, the `budget <budget>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} information
can be filled in.

## Analytic plans {#accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic_plans}

Analytic plans group
`analytic accounts <accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, allowing the company to analyze its accounting, such as
tracking costs and revenues by project or department.

To access analytic plans, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Analytic Plans`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
create a new plan, add a name, and fill in the following information:

- `Parent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Link the plan to another
  analytic plan if a hierarchy between plans must be built.
- `Default Applicability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Define how
  the plan is applied when creating a new journal entry:
  - `Optional`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Adding the analytic
    plan is not mandatory.
  - `Mandatory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The entry cannot be
    confirmed if no analytic account is selected.
  - `Unavailable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The plan is not
    available.
- `Color`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Set a color for the tag
  related to this specific plan.

To fine-tune a plan\'s applicability, create a new line in the
`Applicability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and set the
following fields:

- `Domain`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Choose the accounting
  documents to which the plan applies.
- `Financial Accounts Prefixes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  Enter the prefix(es) of the account(s) to which the plan applies.
- `Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Choose the
  product category to which the plan applies.
- `Applicability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Define how the
  plan is applied when creating a new journal entry. The applicability
  set here always overrides the default applicability.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: In a
  `multi-company </applications/general/companies/multi_company>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} environment, select the company using the plan. To make
  the analytic plan accessible to all companies, leave the field empty.

Two smart buttons are available:

- `Subplans`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: To have a more complex
  analytic structure. Click the smart button, then click
  `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add a subplan. This
  creates a parent-child relationship between the two plans, and the
  `Parent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field of the subplan is
  automatically populated with the original plan.
- `Analytic Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: To access the
  `analytic accounts
  <accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} linked to the plan.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Each analytic plan must have at least one analytic account.
::::

## Analytic distribution {#accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic-distribution}

The distribution of costs in one or more analytic accounts can be set in
each `invoice/bill
<accounting/analytic_accounting/distribution-invoices-bills>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or `en masse
<accounting/analytic_accounting/distribution-mass>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The analytic distribution is prefilled based on the applicability and
the `analytic
distribution models <accounting/analytic_distribution_models>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

### Analytic distribution on invoices or bills {#accounting/analytic_accounting/distribution-invoices-bills}

To add analytic distribution, click the
`Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column when
creating an `invoice <accounting/invoice/creation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or
`bill <accounting/vendor_bills/creation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
mandatory only if the `analytic plan
<accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic_plans>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} has been set as `Mandatory`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in either the `Default Applicability`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field on an analytic plan or the
`Applicability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on an analytic
plan line.
::::

In the `Analytic`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window, select the
desired `Analytic Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
different `Analytic Plans`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} displayed
in columns. Then, split the costs between the accounts by modifying the
percentage.

![create a distribution template](analytic_accounting/analytic-distribution.png)

### Analytic distribution en masse {#accounting/analytic_accounting/distribution-mass}

To mass-edit analytic accounts in several entries simultaneously, go to
`Accounting
--> Accounting --> Journal items`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the ones that need to be updated.
Click the `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column and add the required distribution in the
`Analytic`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, then click the
`oi-close`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(cross)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Update`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
analytic distribution is then added to the selected journal items.

### Analytic distribution models {#accounting/analytic_distribution_models}

Analytic distribution models automatically apply a specific distribution
based on defined criteria.

To create a new analytic distribution model, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Analytic Distribution Models`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and set the conditions
the model has to meet to apply automatically:

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- All specified conditions of an analytic distribution model must be
met for the model to be applied. To apply an analytic distribution model
based on individual conditions, create separate analytic distribution
models for each condition. - Analytic distribution models can be
combined and sequenced, allowing distribution across multiple models if
linked to different
`analytic plans <accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic_plans>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. To adjust the order, drag and drop the models using the
`oi-draggable`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(draggable)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon.
::::

- `Accounts Prefixes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Apply the
  distribution model only to journal items involving accounts that begin
  with specific prefixes.
- `Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Apply the distribution
  model only to journal items involving a specific partner.
- `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Apply the distribution
  model only to journal items involving a specific product.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: In a
  `multi-company </applications/general/companies/multi_company>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} environment, apply the distribution model only to journal
  items involving a specific company. To apply it across all companies,
  leave the field empty.
- `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `Analytic distribution
  <accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic-distribution>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} that will be applied when the above conditions are met.

::: example
Any time a journal item is posted to the
`Utilities (601000)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} account, it
should be automatically distributed in the
`Departments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} analytic plan as
follows:

- 60% to the `Manufacturing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} analytic
  account
- 30% to the `Marketing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} analytic
  account
- 10% to the `Admin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} analytic account

To automate this distribution, the `Accounts Prefix`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} can be set to [601]{.title-ref}, as
`Utilities (601000)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is the only
account in the chart of accounts that begins with [601]{.title-ref}.

If additional accounts such as `Electricity (601100)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Gas (601200)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
are available in the chart of accounts, the distribution will also apply
to both since they share the same prefix.
:::

To define more criteria, use the `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(adjust settings)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon
to reveal more columns or click `View`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on an individual analytic distribution model.

- `Partner Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Apply this
  distribution model only to journal items involving a partner in a
  specific category.
- `Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Apply this
  distribution model to journal items involving a product in a specific
  category.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Alternatively, it is possible to create an analytic distribution model
from the `Analytic`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window by
clicking `New Model`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:

- either when creating an invoice/bill and filling in the
  `analytic distribution
  <accounting/analytic_accounting/distribution-invoices-bills>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"};
- or when `mass-editing analytic accounts
  <accounting/analytic_accounting/distribution-mass>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} in several entries simultaneously.

# Budgets

`Analytic budgets <accounting/budgets/analytic-budgets>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} track specific activities and projects using analytic
accounts, helping businesses make informed decisions about specific
departments, projects, or other groups of transactions. In contrast,
`financial budgets
<accounting/budgets/financial>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are tied
to the general ledger accounts that appear on the profit and loss and
focus on the company\'s overall economic position.

## Analytic budgets {#accounting/budgets/analytic-budgets}

Analytic budgets allow for allocating and tracking income and expenses
in detail, breaking down costs and revenues by specific projects,
departments, or groups of transactions. Analytic budgets can be applied
across various departments or projects to measure profitability and
performance. Odoo manages analytic budgets using
`analytic accounting <analytic_accounting>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

To activate the option for creating analytic budgets, go to
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
enable `Budget Management`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Analytics`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo structures budgets using
`plans <accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic_plans>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and
`accounts <accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, which must be configured *before* creating a budget.
::::

### Set an analytic budget {#accounting/budgets/analytic-budget-set}

To create a new budget, go to
`Accounting --> Accounting --> Analytic Budgets`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Make sure the following fields are appropriately
completed: `Budget
Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Period`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `Budget Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Budget Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to structure the
budget with the
`analytic plans <accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic_plans>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `accounts
<accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} previously created. While the `analytic
plans <accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic_plans>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} correspond to the column names, select the
`analytic accounts <accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to define the budget lines and set the amounts for each in
the `Budgeted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. Once all the
budget lines are settled, click `Open`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. If changes need to be made once the budget\'s status
is `Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, there are two options:

- `Reset to Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: To overwrite the
  data, then reopen the budget.
- `Revise`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A new budget will be
  created. Once it is `Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
  `Rev`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} reference is added to the
  `Budget Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The original budget
  is then `Revised`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Check an analytic budget {#accounting/budgets/analytic-budget-check}

Once the budget is `Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, two
additional columns are available: `Committed`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Achieved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
These columns\' amounts are automatically calculated based on the
related
`analytic distribution <accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic-distribution>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} of journal items. When the
`analytic distribution <accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic-distribution>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} of a journal item within the budget\'s period is updated,
the budget\'s columns for the analytic account(s) selected in the
distribution are automatically updated. The `Achieved`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} amount reflects the current result according to the
items of confirmed journal entries for the associated
`analytic account <accounting/analytic_accounting/analytic_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. In contrast, the `Committed`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} amount displays the full value of the
`Achieved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} amount, plus any confirmed
purchase orders that have not yet been billed.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- When a line in a request for quotation or purchase order includes an
analytic distribution, a `Budget`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
smart button appears, providing a link to the `budget report
<accounting/budgets/analytic-budget-reporting>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for more details. - For `Open`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} budgets, if a request for quotation or a purchase order
is created using the associated analytic distribution and exceeds the
allocated budget amount, the corresponding purchase order line is
highlighted in red.
::::

To reveal the `Theoretical`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} amount or
percentage, use the `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
(`adjust settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) icon in the
`Budget Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}\' header. The
`Theoretical`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} amount represents the
amount of money that could theoretically have been spent or should have
been received based on the current date relative to the start/end dates.
Click `Details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open a filtered
view of the `budget report
<accounting/budgets/analytic-budget-reporting>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} related to that specific budget line.

![open budget with committed, achieved, and theoretical amounts](budget/budget.png)

Note
:::

Deleting a budget is only allowed in the `Draft`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Cancelled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
stages.
::::

To view the budget lines of one or multiple budgets directly from the
`Budgets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list view, select the
budget(s) and click `Budget Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Generate periodic budgets {#accounting/budgets/analytic-budget-generate}

To create periodic budgets (monthly, quarterly, and yearly) for the
selected `Analytic
Plans`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click
`Generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. A new budget is created
for each `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} between the start
and end dates:

- If a single analytic plan is selected, each budget includes a line for
  each account in that analytic plan.
- If multiple analytic plans are selected, each budget includes a line
  for each account/analytic plan combination.

To generate periodic budgets, follow these steps:

1.  In the `Budgets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list view, click
    `Generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

2.  In the `Generate Budget`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window,
    set the dates and select the `Period`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} and the `Analytic Plans`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

    ![all the options to generate periodical budgets](budget/generate-budgets.png)

3.  Click `Split`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create the
    periodic budgets.

4.  Click `Budgets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the top-left
    corner to return to the `Budgets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    list view.

5.  One by one, click on the different periodic budgets with the
    `Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status to open them and
    set the amounts in the `Budgeted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    column for each analytic account linked to the chosen analytic
    plans.

6.  Click `Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for each periodic
    budget.

### Reporting {#accounting/budgets/analytic-budget-reporting}

To perform various reporting actions, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting -->
Budget Report`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, then:

- Track, analyze, and compare budget data.
- Filter and group data using the `fa-plus-square`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} (`plus-square`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) or
  `fa-minus-square`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(minus-square)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon.
- Drill down into the report to see more details on the actual amounts
  and transactions.
- Export the data for further analysis or reporting needs.

## Financial budgets {#accounting/budgets/financial}

Financial budgets are structured around specific income and expense
accounts and transactions for official financial reporting and
compliance purposes.

:::: note

Note
:::

Financial budgets are available on the `Profit and Loss
<accounting/reporting/profit-and-loss>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
report.
::::

### Set a financial budget {#accounting/budgets/financial-budget-set}

To create a new financial budget, follow these steps:

1.  Go to
    `Accounting --> Reporting --> Profit and Loss`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} to open the
    `Profit and Loss <accounting/reporting/profit-and-loss>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} report.
2.  Click the `fa-calendar`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    `(calendar)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to use the
    date selector and choose a period.
3.  Click the `fa-bar-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    `Budget`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and name the
    budget. A new column labeled with the budget name will appear next
    to the `Balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.
4.  Assign amounts to each account requiring analysis.
5.  A new `%`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column will appear to
    the right of the new budget column, indicating the current status.

Different financial budgets can be created using these steps for
comparison purposes.

# Custom reports

Odoo comes with a powerful and easy-to-use reporting framework. The
engine allows you to create new reports, such as tax reports, balance
sheets, and income statements with specific groupings and layouts.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Activate the `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to access the accounting report configuration.
::::

To create a new report, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Accounting Reports`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. From here, create either a
`root report <customize-reports/root>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or
a `variant
<customize-reports/variants>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- Consider saving modified reports as report variants to keep their
root reports intact. - To access an existing report\'s management
interface from the report itself, click on the
`fa-cogs`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(gears)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon.
::::

## Root reports {#customize-reports/root}

Root reports can be regarded as generic, neutral accounting reports.
They serve as models on which local accounting versions are built. If a
report has no root report, it is considered to be a root report itself.

::: example
A tax report for Belgium and the US would both use the same generic
version as a base and adapt it for their domestic regulations.
:::

Creating a menu item is required to access a new root report. To do so,
open the report\'s configuration, click `Action`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Create Menu Item`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and refresh the page. The report is now available under
`Accounting --> Reporting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Cases that require creating a new root report are rare, such as when a
country\'s tax authorities require a new and specific type of report.
::::

## Variants {#customize-reports/variants}

Variants are country-specific versions of root reports and, therefore,
always refer to a root report. To create a variant, select a generic
(root) report in the `Root Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field when creating a new report.

When a root report is opened from the Accounting app\'s
`Reporting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu, all of its variants
are displayed in the report variant selector in the top right corner of
the view.

::: example
`VAT Report (BE)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is a variant of the
root `Generic Tax report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Report variant selection.](customize/engine-variant.png)
:::

## Lines {#accounting/customize/lines}

After creating a report (either root or variant), the next step is to
fill it with lines. To create a new line, click on
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To modify an existing
line, click on the line itself and edit the popup. All lines require a
`Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and can have an optional
`Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} which allows using the line\'s
value in formulas.

![Engine lines options.](customize/engine-lines-options.png)

## Expressions

Each line can contain one or multiple **expressions**. Expressions can
be seen as **sub-variables** needed by a report line. To create an
expression, click on `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
*within* a line\'s popup.

When creating an expression, you must enter a `Label`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} used to refer to that expression. The label must be
unique among the expressions of each report line. Both the `Computation
Engine`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
`Formula`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields must also be
completed. The **computation engine** defines how the **formula(s)** and
**subformula(s)** are interpreted. It is possible to mix expressions
using different computation engines under the same line if needed.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Depending on the engine, `subformulas`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} may also be required.
::::

### Odoo Domain computation engine

When using the `Odoo Domain`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
computation engine, a formula is interpreted as an `Odoo
domain <reference/orm/domains>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} targeting
[account.move.line]{.title-ref} objects.

The subformula allows you to define how the move lines matching the
domain are used to compute the value of the expression:

[sum]{.title-ref}

:   The result is the sum of all the balances of the matched move lines.

[sum_if_pos]{.title-ref}

:   The result is the sum of all the balances of the matched move lines
    if this amount is positive. Otherwise, it is [0]{.title-ref}.

[sum_if_neg]{.title-ref}

:   The result is the sum of all the balances of the matched move lines
    if this amount is negative. Otherwise, it is [0]{.title-ref}.

[count_rows]{.title-ref}

:   The result is the number of sub-lines of this expression. If the
    parent line has a `group-by
    <customize-reports/lines-group-by>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    value, this will correspond to the number of distinct grouping keys
    in the matched move lines. Otherwise, it will be the number of
    matched move lines.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To **reverse** the sign of the result, put a [-]{.title-ref} sign at the
beginning of the subformula.
::::

![Expression line within a line report](customize/engine-expressions.png)

### Tax Tags computation engine

When using the `Tax Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} computation
engine, the contents of the `Formula`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field are matched to tax tags. If such tags do not exist when creating
the expression, they will be created.

When evaluating the expression, the expression computation can roughly
be expressed as: **(amount of the move lines with** [+]{.title-ref}
**tag)** [-]{.title-ref} **(amount of the move lines with**
[-]{.title-ref} **tag)**.

::: example
If the `Formula`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
[tag_name]{.title-ref}, the engine matches tax tags
[+tag_name]{.title-ref} and [-tag_name]{.title-ref}, creating them if
necessary. To exemplify further: two tags are matched by the formula. If
the formula is [A]{.title-ref}, it will require (and create, if needed)
tags [+A]{.title-ref} and [-A]{.title-ref}.
:::

### Aggregate Other Formulas computation engine

The `Aggregate Other Formulas`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
computation engine performs arithmetic operations on the amounts
obtained from other expressions. Formulas here are composed of
references to expressions separated by one of the four basic arithmetic
operators (addition [+]{.title-ref}, subtraction [-]{.title-ref},
division [/]{.title-ref}, and multiplication [\*]{.title-ref}). To refer
to an expression, type in its parent line\'s **code** followed by a
period [.]{.title-ref} and the expression\'s **label** (ex.
**code.label**).

**Subformulas** can be one of the following:

[if_above(CUR(amount))]{.title-ref}

:   The value of the arithmetic expression will be returned only if it
    is greater than the provided bound. Otherwise, the result will be
    [0]{.title-ref}.

[if_below(CUR(amount))]{.title-ref}

:   The value of the arithmetic expression will be returned only if it
    is lower than the provided bound. Otherwise, the result will be
    [0]{.title-ref}.

[if_between(CUR1(amount1), CUR2(amount2))]{.title-ref}

:   The value of the arithmetic expression will be returned only if it
    is strictly between the provided bounds. Otherwise, it will be
    brought back to the closest bound.

[if_other_expr_above(LINE_CODE.EXPRESSION_LABEL, CUR(amount))]{.title-ref}

:   The value of the arithmetic expression will be returned only if the
    value of the expression denoted by the provided line code and
    expression label is greater than the provided bound. Otherwise, the
    result will be [0]{.title-ref}.

[if_other_expr_below(LINE_CODE.EXPRESSION_LABEL, CUR(amount))]{.title-ref}

:   The value of the arithmetic expression will be returned only if the
    value of the expression denoted by the provided line code and
    expression label is lower than the provided bound. Otherwise, the
    result will be [0]{.title-ref}.

[CUR]{.title-ref} is the currency code in capital letters, and
[amount]{.title-ref} is the amount of the bound expressed in that
currency.

[cross_report(xml_id \| report_id)]{.title-ref}

:   Used to match an expression from another report targeted by the
    xml_id or the report ID itself.

### Prefix of Account Codes computation engine

The `Prefix of Account Codes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
computation engine is used to match amounts made on accounts using the
prefixes of these accounts\' codes as variables in an arithmetic
expression.

::: example
\| [21]{.title-ref} \| Arithmetic expressions can also be a single
prefix, such as here.
:::

::: example
\| [21 + 10 - 5]{.title-ref} \| This formula adds the balances of the
move lines made on accounts whose codes start with [21]{.title-ref} and
[10]{.title-ref}, and subtracts the balance of the ones on accounts with
the prefix [5]{.title-ref}.
:::

It is also possible to ignore a selection of sub-prefixes.

::: example
\| [21 + 10(101, 102) - 5(57)]{.title-ref} \| This formula works the
same way as the previous example but ignores the prefixes
[101]{.title-ref}, [102]{.title-ref}, and [57]{.title-ref}.
:::

You can apply \'sub-filtering\' on **credits and debits** using the
[C]{.title-ref} and [D]{.title-ref} suffixes. In this case, an account
will only be considered if its prefix matches, *and* if the total
balance of the move lines made on this account is **credit/debit**.

::: example
Account [210001]{.title-ref} has a balance of -42 and account
[210002]{.title-ref} has a balance of 25. The formula [21D]{.title-ref}
only matches the account [210002]{.title-ref}, and hence returns 25.
[210001]{.title-ref} is not matched, as its balance is *credit*.
:::

Prefix exclusions can be mixed with the [C]{.title-ref} and
[D]{.title-ref} suffixes.

::: example
\| [21D + 10(101, 102)C - 5(57)]{.title-ref} \| This formula adds the
balances of the move lines made on accounts whose code starts with
[21]{.title-ref} *if* it is debit ([D]{.title-ref}) and [10]{.title-ref}
*if* it is credit ([C]{.title-ref}), but ignores prefixes
[101]{.title-ref}, [102]{.title-ref}, and subtracts the balance of the
ones on accounts with the prefix [5]{.title-ref}, ignoring the prefix
[57]{.title-ref}.
:::

To match the letter [C]{.title-ref} or [D]{.title-ref} in a prefix and
not use it as a suffix, use an empty exclusion [()]{.title-ref}.

::: example
\| [21D()]{.title-ref} \| This formula matches accounts whose code
starts with [21D]{.title-ref}, regardless of their balance sign.
:::

In addition to using code prefixes to include accounts, you can also
match them with **account tags**. This is especially useful, for
example, if your country lacks a standardized chart of accounts, where
the same prefix might be used for different purposes across companies.

::: example
\| [tag(25)]{.title-ref} \| This formula matches accounts whose
associated tags contain the one with ID *25*.
:::

If the tag you reference is defined in a data file, an XMLID can be used
instead of the ID.

::: example
\| [tag(my_module.my_tag)]{.title-ref} \| This formula matches accounts
whose associated tags include the tag denoted by *my_module.my_tag*.
:::

You can also use arithmetic expressions with tags, possibly combining
them with prefix selections.

::: example
\| [tag(my_module.my_tag) + tag(42) + 10]{.title-ref} \| The balances of
accounts tagged as *my_module.my_tag* will be summed with those of
accounts linked to the tag with ID *42* and accounts with the code
prefix [10]{.title-ref}
:::

[C]{.title-ref} and [D]{.title-ref} suffixes can be used in the same way
with tags.

::: example
\| [tag(my_module.my_tag)C]{.title-ref} \| This formula matches accounts
with the tag *my_module.my_tag* and a credit balance.
:::

Prefix exclusion also works with tags.

::: example
\| [tag(my_module.my_tag)(10)]{.title-ref} \| This formula matches
accounts with the tag *my_module.my_tag* and a code not starting with
[10]{.title-ref}.
:::

### External Value computation engine

The `External Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} computation
engine is used to refer to **manual** and **carryover values**. Those
values are not stored using [account.move.line]{.title-ref}, but with
[account.report.external.value]{.title-ref}. Each of these objects
directly points to the expression it impacts, so very little needs to be
done about their selection here.

**Formulas** can be one of the following:

[sum]{.title-ref}

:   If the result must be the sum of all the external values in the
    period.

[most_recent]{.title-ref}

:   If the result must be the value of the latest external value in the
    period.

In addition, **subformulas** can be used in two ways:

[rounding=X]{.title-ref}

:   Replacing [X]{.title-ref} with a number instructs to round the
    amount to X decimals.

[editable]{.title-ref}

:   Indicates this expression can be edited manually, triggering the
    display of an icon in the report, allowing the user to perform this
    action.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Manual values are created at the [date_to]{.title-ref} currently
selected in the report.
::::

Both subformulas can be mixed by separating them with a [;]{.title-ref}.

::: example
\| [editable;rounding=2]{.title-ref} \| This subformula shows the
correct way to mix both behaviors.
:::

### Custom Python Function computation engine

The `Custom Python Function`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
computation engine is a means for developers to introduce custom
computation of expressions on a case-by-case basis. The
`Formula`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is the name of a **python
function** to call, and the `Subformula`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is a **key** to fetch in the **dictionary** returned by
this function. Use this computation engine only if making a custom
module.

## Columns

Reports can have an **indefinite number** of columns to display. Each
column gets its values from the **expressions** declared on the
**lines**. The field `expression_label`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of the column gives the label of the expressions whose
value is displayed. If a line has no **expression** in that field, then
nothing is displayed for it in this column. If multiple columns are
required, you must use different **expression** labels.

![Columns of report.](customize/engine-columns.png)

When using the **period comparison** feature found under the
`Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of an accounting
report, all columns are repeated in and for each period.

## Line grouping {#customize-reports/lines-group-by}

Non-standard grouping is possible by adding or using existing fields on
the *Journal Item* model, provided that the fields are related and
non-stored.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Grouping lines requires the report to have explicit report lines that
can be edited. The deferred reports, for example, do not support
grouping lines as they use dynamic lines that are generated.
::::

### Create a new field on journal item

To create a non-stored, related field in the *Journal Item* model, first
go to `Accounting --> Journal Items`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click the `fa-bug`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(bug)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, then click
`Fields`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a new field, and
complete the following fields:

- `Field Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a technical name for
  the field

- `Field Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the label to be
  displayed for the field

- `Field Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the type of field
  that this related field should point to

- `Stored`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Leave this field
  unchecked as only non-stored fields can be used to group lines.

- `Related Model`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the field type
  is `one2many`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `many2many`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `many2one`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select the model of the
  original field to group by.

- `Related Field Definition`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  technical path to the field you want to group by

  ::: example
  To group by the sales team of the commercial partner, set the related
  field definition to [move_id.team_id]{.title-ref}.
  :::

### Group lines

To group lines, go to the
`Lines <accounting/customize/lines>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} tab
of the desired report, click on the line you want to group, and edit the
`Group by`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Enter the technical
name (`Field Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) of the field to
use as the grouping key.

:::: tip

# Data inalterability check report

Tax authorities in some countries require companies to **prove their
posted accounting entries are unaltered**, meaning that once an entry
has been secured, it can no longer be changed.

To do so, Odoo creates a unique fingerprint for each secured entry
thanks to the **SHA-256 algorithm**. This fingerprint is called a hash.
The hash is generated by taking an entry\'s essential data (the values
of the [name]{.title-ref}, [date]{.title-ref}, [journal_id]{.title-ref},
[company_id]{.title-ref}, [debit]{.title-ref}, [credit]{.title-ref},
[account_id]{.title-ref}, and [partner_id]{.title-ref} fields),
concatenating it, and inputting it to the SHA-256 hash function, which
then outputs a fixed size (256-bit) string of characters. The hash
function is deterministic (`the
same input always creates the same output`{.interpreted-text
role="dfn"}): any minor modification to the original data would
completely change the resulting hash. Consequently, the SHA-256
algorithm is often used, among others, for data integrity verification
purposes.

In addition, the previous entry\'s hash is always added to the next
entry to form a **hash chain**. This is used to ensure a new entry is
not added afterward between two secured entries, as doing so would break
the hash chain.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Hashes generated by the SHA-256 algorithm are theoretically not unique,
as there is a finite number of possible values. However, this number is
exceptionally high: 2²⁵⁶, which is a lot bigger than the number of atoms
in the known universe. This is why hashes are considered unique in
practice.
::::

## Inalterability features {#data-inalterability/inalterability_features}

Inalterability features can be enabled by activating the
`secure posted entries with hash
<data-inalterability/restricted>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} option
on any journal or using the `secure entries wizard
<data-inalterability/wizard>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

- Two indicators are added to the journal entry\'s form view. They show
  whether the entry is secured or not.
  - A `fa-lock`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} or
    `fa-unlock`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    (`lock icon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) next to the
    `Posted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} state.
  - A `Secured`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox in the
    `Other info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
- A `Not Secured`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter is available
  on journal entries and journal items\' list views. It can be used to
  find posted journal entries that are not secured yet.
- The option to open the
  `secure entries wizard <data-inalterability/wizard>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} is displayed in the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} menu.

## Secure posted entries with hash {#data-inalterability/restricted}

To activate the hashing function on a specific journal, go to
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Open a sales, purchase, or miscellaneous journal, go to the
`Advanced Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and enable
`Secure Posted Entries with Hash`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Journals for which the feature is activated are called \"restricted\".

To compute the hash of an entry, Odoo retrieves the predecessor entries
of the chain (i.e., the entries with the same sequence prefix) and
hashes them in a continuous way from the last hashed entry to the new
entry to hash.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Once you post an entry in a restricted journal, you cannot disable the
feature anymore, nor edit any secured entry.
::::

## Secure entries wizard {#data-inalterability/wizard}

You can also use the `Secure Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
Wizard to secure all journal entries, in **all** journals, up to a
specific date.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The wizard operates independently of the journal settings and journal
types.
::::

To open it, activate the
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, go to
`Accounting
--> Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click on
`Secure Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If the
`inalterability features
<data-inalterability/inalterability_features>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are activated, it is also visible outside the debug mode.

To secure entries, select a date up to which all entries should be
secured and press `Secure Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

After securing the entries, you can no longer edit them.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It can happen that entries that are past the selected date are secured.
This is possible since the hash chain corresponds to the sequence
prefix, ordered by sequence number.
::::

## Report download {#data-inalterability/report}

To download the data inalterability check report, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration
--> Settings --> Reporting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
click on
`Download the Data Inalterability Check Report`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

The report\'s first section is an overview of all journal sequence
prefixes containing hashed entries. In the
`Restricted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, you can see
whether or not a journal has the `secure
posted entries with hash <data-inalterability/restricted>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} option (V) activated or not (X). The
`Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column tells you whether all
entries are correctly hashed.

![Configuration report for two journals](data_inalterability/journal-overview.png){.align-center}

The second section gives a more detailed result of the data consistency
check for each hashed journal sequence prefix. You can view the first
hashed entry and its corresponding hash, as well as the last hashed
entry and its corresponding hash.

# Intrastat

Intrastat is the data collection and statistics production system for
goods traded among EU member states. It collects data on:

- Commercial transactions of goods for use, consumption, investment, or
  resale with ownership transfer;
- Goods movements without transfer of ownership (e.g., stock relocations
  or moves of goods before or after outsourced production or processing,
  and after maintenance or repair);
- Returns of goods.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Although the Intrastat system continues to be used, the term Intrastat
is not used in the [latest
legislation](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/2152/2022-01-01),
referring instead to *intra-Union trade in goods statistics*.

## General configuration {#intrastat/general-configuration}

Enable the Intrastat report by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Under the `Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, tick `Intrastat`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and then `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Default transaction codes: invoice and refund {#intrastat/default-transaction-codes}

You can set a default
`transaction code <intrastat/transaction-code>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for all newly created invoice and refund transactions. Under
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select a
`Default invoice transaction code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and/or a `Default refund transaction
code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and then
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The code will be set
automatically on all respective invoice lines.

### Region code {#intrastat/region-code}

The region code is **only used by Belgian companies**. Under
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
select the `Company Intrastat Region`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
where the company is located and then `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If your warehouses are located in more than one region, you can define
the region code at the level of each warehouse instead. To do so, go to
`Inventory --> Configuration -->
Warehouses`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select a warehouse,
set its `Intrastat region`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and then
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Adding the Intrastat region to a warehouse](intrastat/warehouse-region.png){.align-center}
::::

## Product configuration {#intrastat/product-configuration}

All products must be properly configured to be included in the Intrastat
report.

### Commodity code {#intrastat/commodity-code}

Commodity codes are internationally recognized reference numbers used to
classify goods depending on their **nature**. Intrastat uses the
[Combined
Nomenclature](https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/customs-4/calculation-customs-duties/customs-tariff/combined-nomenclature_en).

To add a commodity code, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select a product. Under the
`Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, set the product\'s
`Commodity Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
[National Bank of Belgium - Intrastat commodity
codes](https://www.nbb.be/en/statistics/foreign-trade/nomenclature-and-codes)
:::

### Quantity: weight and supplementary unit {#intrastat/quantity}

Depending on the nature of the goods, it is necessary to specify either
the product\'s weight in kilos (without packaging) or the product\'s
supplementary unit, such as square meter ([m2]{.title-ref}), number of
items ([p/st]{.title-ref}), liter ([l]{.title-ref}), or gram
([g]{.title-ref}).

To add a product\'s weight or supplementary unit, go to
`Accounting --> Customers -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select a product.
Under the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, depending
on the commodity code set, either fill in the product
`Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or its
`Supplementary Units`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Country of origin {#intrastat/origin-country}

To add the product\'s country of origin, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select a product. Under the
`Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, set the
`Country of Origin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Invoices and bills configuration {#intrastat/invoice-bill-configuration}

Once products are properly configured, several settings must be
configured on the invoices and bills you create.

### Transaction code {#intrastat/transaction-code}

Transaction codes are used to identify a transaction\'s nature.
`Default transaction codes
<intrastat/default-transaction-codes>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} can
be set for invoice and refund transactions.

To set a transaction code on an invoice line, create an invoice or a
bill, click the columns selection button, tick
`Intrastat`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and use the newly-added
`Intrastat`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column to select a
transaction code.

:::

### Partner country {#intrastat/partner-country}

The partner country represents the vendor\'s country for bills and the
customer\'s country for invoices. It is automatically filled in using
the country set in the contact\'s `Country`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

To edit the partner country manually, create an invoice or a bill, click
the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and select the
`Intrastat Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Transport code {#intrastat/transport-code}

The transport code identifies the presumed **mode of transport** used to
send the goods (arrival or dispatch).

To add the transport code, create an invoice or a bill, go to the
`Other info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and select the
`Intrastat Transport Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Value of the goods {#intrastat/value}

The value of a good is the untaxed `Subtotal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} (`Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} multiplied
by `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) of an invoice line.

## Partner configuration {#intrastat/partner}

Two fields from the partner\'s contact form are used with Intrastat:
`VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `Country`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The country can be
`manually set <intrastat/partner-country>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
on the invoice or bill.

## Generate the Intrastat report

Generate the report by going to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Audit Reports:
Intrastat Report`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. It is
automatically computed based on the `default configuration
<intrastat/general-configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and the
information found on the `products
<intrastat/product-configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`invoices and bills
<intrastat/invoice-bill-configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
and `partners <intrastat/partner>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Export the report as a PDF, XLSX, or XML file to post it to your legal
administration.

Each report line refers to a single invoice line and contains the
following information:

- Invoice or bill reference number;
- System, which is a code automatically generated depending on whether
  the document is an invoice (dispatch) or a bill (arrival);
- `Country <intrastat/partner-country>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
  which is the vendor\'s country for arrivals and the customer\'s
  country for dispatches;
- `Transaction Code <intrastat/transaction-code>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"};

# Silverfin integration

[Silverfin](https://www.silverfin.com) is a third-party service provider
that offers a cloud platform for accountants.

Odoo and Silverfin provide an integration to automate the
synchronization of data.

## Configuration

To configure this integration, you need to input the following data into
your Silverfin account:

- user\'s email address
- `Odoo API key <silverfin/api-key>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
- URL of the Odoo database
- name of your Odoo database

### Odoo API key {#silverfin/api-key}

You can create Odoo external API keys either
`for a single database <silverfin/api-singledb>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (hosting: Odoo Online, On-premise, and Odoo.sh) or
`for all databases managed by a single user
<silverfin/api-multipledb>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} (hosting: Odoo
Online).

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

\- These API keys are personal and provide full access to your user
account. Store it securely. - You can copy the API key only at its
creation. It is not possible to retrieve it later. - If you need it
again, create a new API key (and delete the old one).
::::

::: seealso
`/developer/reference/external_api`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

#### Per database {#silverfin/api-singledb}

To add an API key to a **single** database, connect to the database,
enable the `developer
mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, click on the user
menu, and then `My Profile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} /
`Preferences`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Under the
`Account Security`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click on
`New API
Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, confirm your password, give a
descriptive name to your new key, and copy the API key.

:::

#### For all databases (fiduciaries) {#silverfin/api-multipledb}

To add an API key to **all** databases managed by a single user at the
same time **(the easiest method for fiduciaries)**, navigate to [Odoo\'s
website](https://www.odoo.com) and sign in with your administrator
account. Next, open [your account security settings in developer
mode](https://www.odoo.com/my/security?debug=1), click on
`New API Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, confirm your password,
give a descriptive name to your new key, and copy the new API key.

# Tax carryover

When performing tax reports, the **tax carryover** feature allows
carrying amounts from one period to another without creating new
entries.

It has been created to meet the legal requirements of specific
locations, where amounts must be transferred from period to period (for
example, because the total of the line is negative).

The feature is activated by default in countries where it is required,
such as Belgium, France, and Italy. There is no specific configuration
required.

Let's take an example of a Belgian company that created a credit note of
100 for one of their customers. The due tax is 21%.

![Illustration with a credit note](tax_carryover/belgian-example.png){.align-center}

In this case, as per local regulation, grid 81 of the tax report may
contain a negative amount. But it must be declared to the government as
zero, and the negative amount should be carried over to the next period.

If we go to
`Accounting app --> Reporting --> Tax Report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, a pop-up on line 81 explains that the amount will
be carried over in the next period.

![pop-up message stating the amount will be carried over to the next period](tax_carryover/pop-up.png){.align-center}

At the time of the tax closing period, the tax report shows that the
amount was carried over from the previous period. It also indicates the
amount that will be carried over to this line in the next period based
on the existing transactions and the carryover from the previous period.

![Illustration of the tax return](tax_carryover/tax-return.png){.align-center}

# Tax return (VAT report)

Companies with a registered `VAT (Value Added Tax)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} number are required to submit a tax return monthly or
quarterly, depending on their turnover and the applicable regulatory
requirements. A tax return - or VAT report - provides the tax
authorities with information about the taxable transactions made by the
company. The **output tax** is charged on the sale of goods and
services, while the **input tax** refers to the tax included in the
price of purchased goods or services. Based on these values, the company
can calculate the tax amount they must pay or be refunded.

## Configuration {#accounting/tax-returns/configuration}

### Tax return periodicity {#accounting/tax-returns/periodicity}

The configuration of the tax return periodicity allows Odoo to compute
tax returns correctly and automatically send reminders to make sure that
deadlines are met.

To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, navigate to the
`Tax Return Periodicity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and
update the following fields, if needed:

- `Periodicity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Define the tax
  return periodicity.
- `Deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Define when Odoo should
  send reminders to submit the tax return.
- `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Update the journal where
  the tax return is recorded, if needed.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This information is usually configured during the
`app's initial setup <../get_started>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
::::

### Tax grids {#accounting/tax-returns/tax-grids}

Odoo generates tax reports based on the `Tax Grids`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} settings configured for each tax. All recorded
transactions must apply the correct tax rates to ensure accurate
reporting.

`Tax Grids`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are displayed in the
`Journal Items`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of any invoice or
bill.

![example of tax grids used on an invoice](tax_returns/tax-return-grids.png)

To configure tax grids for taxes, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, open the relevant tax, and edit the tax settings
and the tax grids used to record invoices or refunds.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Taxes and reports are usually pre-configured according to the country
selected for the
`company <../../../general/companies>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
::::

### Tax returns journal {#accounting/tax-returns/tax-return-journal}

On the Accounting dashboard, complete the following actions displayed in
the `Tax Returns`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} journal before
creating tax returns:

- `Set Company Data`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `Configure the company details <general/companies/company>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- `Set Periods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: In the
  `Accounting Periods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window, fill
  in the `Opening date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Fiscal Year End`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and update the
  `Periodicity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if needed.
- `Review Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

## Close a tax period {#accounting/tax-returns/close}

### Tax return lock date {#accounting/tax-returns/lock-date}

Setting a tax lock date prevents changes that could impact VAT-related
journal entries. Locking the period before processing the
`Closing Journal Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} helps ensure
the accuracy of the final report and reduces the risk of tax errors.

To view or edit the current `Lock Tax Return`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} date, go to `Accounting -->
Accounting --> Lock Dates`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Any new transaction whose accounting date is before the
`Lock Tax Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} date has its tax
values moved to the next open tax period, preventing any changes to a
report after its period is closed.
::::

### Tax return {#accounting/tax-returns/report}

On the Accounting Dashboard, the `Tax Returns`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} journal displays automatic reminders to avoid missing
important tasks and deadlines.

After completing all
`configurations <accounting/tax-returns/configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and posting all tax-related transactions for the reporting
period, click `Tax Returns`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
`Tax Returns`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} journal from the
Accounting dashboard. Alternatively, go to
`Accounting --> Accounting --> Tax Returns`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

The `Tax Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view displays a
chronological list of all pending `tax returns (VAT
report) <accounting/tax-returns/vat-report>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `advance payments
<accounting/tax-returns/advance-payments>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
(based on the `fiscal localization
<../../fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}). Each item
on the list includes:

- A period (month or quarter).
- A deadline date.
- The related company and
  `branch(es) <general/branches>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, if
  applicable.
- Action steps, such as
  `Review <accounting/tax-returns/vat-return-review>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, `Submit
  <accounting/tax-returns/vat-return-submit>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, and `Pay
  <accounting/tax-returns/vat-return-pay>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, which turn green when completed.
- Action buttons: These are displayed as primary (purple) and secondary
  (grey) buttons to indicate their priority.
- A `fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(vertical ellipsis)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu for
  additional options.

##### Review {#accounting/tax-returns/vat-return-review}

To start the review of a tax return, click on the relevant tax return
line:

- If all automatic tax validation checks have passed, click
  `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to complete the
  `Review`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} step. The
  `Lock Tax Return <accounting/tax-returns/lock-date>`{.interpreted-text

- If any automatic tax validation checks are pending, the
  `Tax Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view displays the
  following, depending on the
  `fiscal localization <../../fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}:

  - `Bank Matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This check is
    used to identify any missing bills; it is optional for VAT reports.
  - `Bill attachments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Bills must
    have attached documents as proof in case of an audit.
  - `Company data`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Missing
    information (e.g., VAT number or country) can lead to errors in tax
    reports or exemptions.
  - `Draft entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Any draft
    invoices and bills within the corresponding period must be reviewed
    and posted, or assigned a different accounting date.
  - `No negative amount in VAT report`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}: Some countries only allow positive values in tax
    returns, as a negative amount could indicate misconfigurations.
  - `Taxes and countries matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    Taxes applied on invoices and bills must match the customer's
    country.

  Each check card is either highlighted in green (Reviewed or
  Supervised), red (Anomaly) or grey (To review). If a check fails,
  there are two options:

  - Click on the failed check\'s card to fix the issue.
  - Click `Anomaly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select
    `Reviewed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `Supervised`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to pass the check
    without fixing the issue.

  Once all checks have passed, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. Then, depending on the `fiscal
  localization <../../fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, click `Lock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
  `Lock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window.

  On validating the tax return, the
  `Lock Tax Return <accounting/tax-returns/lock-date>`{.interpreted-text

# Year-end closing

Year-end closing is essential for maintaining financial accuracy,
complying with regulations, making informed decisions, and ensuring
transparency in reporting.

::: seealso
`Tax return <tax_returns>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Fiscal years {#accounting/year-end/fiscal-years}

By default, the fiscal year is set to last 12 months and ends on
December 31st. However, its duration and end date can vary due to
cultural, administrative, and economic considerations.

To modify these values, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Under the `Fiscal Periods`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, change the `Last Day`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field if necessary.

If the period lasts *more* than or *less* than 12 months, enable
`Fiscal Years`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Go back to the
`Fiscal Periods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section and click
`oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Fiscal Years`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, give it a
`Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and both a
`Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Once the set fiscal period is over, Odoo automatically reverts to the
default periodicity, considering the value specified in the
`Last Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
::::

## Year-end checklist {#accounting/year-end/checklist}

### Before closure {#accounting/year-end/before-closure}

Before closing a fiscal year, ensure that everything is accurate and
up-to-date:

- Make sure all bank accounts are fully
  `reconciled <../bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} up
  to year-end and confirm that the ending book balances match the bank
  statement balances.
- Confirm that all
  `customer invoices <../customer_invoices>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and `vendor bills
  <../vendor_bills>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} have been created and
  all draft entries have been either confirmed or cancelled, as needed.
- Ensure the accuracy of all
  `expenses <../../expenses>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and validate
  them.
- Check that all `received payments <../payments>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} have been encoded and confirmed.
- Close all
  `suspense accounts <accounting/journals/bank-cash-cc>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- Ensure `loans <../bank/loans>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} are
  properly registered for automatic amortization calculations.
- Review overdue payables and receivables aged over 60 days, and assess
  whether a provision for uncertain liabilities or an allowance for
  doubtful accounts is required.
- Book all `depreciation <../vendor_bills/assets>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and `deferred revenue
  <../customer_invoices/deferred_revenues>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} entries.

### Closing a fiscal year {#accounting/year-end/closing-a-fiscal-year}

Then, to close the fiscal year:

- Run a `tax report <accounting/reporting/tax-report>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, and verify that all tax information is correct.
- Reconcile all accounts on the
  `balance sheet <accounting/reporting/balance-sheet>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}:
  - Update the bank balances in Odoo to reflect the actual balances as
    per the bank statements.
  - Reconcile all transactions in the cash and bank accounts by running
    the `aged receivables
    <accounting/reporting/aged-receivable>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and `aged payables
    <accounting/reporting/aged-payable>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    reports.
  - Audit all accounts, fully understanding all transactions and their
    nature, including `loans
    <../bank/loans>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
    `fixed assets <../vendor_bills/assets>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}.
  - Optionally,
    `match payments <accounting/payments/payments-matching>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} to validate any open vendor bills and customer invoices
    with their payments. While this step is optional, it could assist
    the year-end closing process if all outstanding payments and
    invoices are reconciled, potentially finding errors or mistakes in
    the system.

Next, the accountant likely verifies balance sheet items and book
entries for:

> - year-end manual adjustments,
> - work in progress,
> - depreciation journal entries,
> - loans,
> - tax adjustments,
> - etc.

During the year-end audit, the accountant may print paper copies of all
balance sheet items (e.g., loans, bank accounts, prepayments, sales tax
statements) to compare them against the balances recorded in Odoo.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

As part of this process, setting a `Lock Everything
<accounting/year-end/lock-everything-date>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} date to the last day (inclusive) of the preceding fiscal
year is good practice. This ensures that journal entries with an
accounting date on or before the lock date cannot be created or modified
during the audit. Users with *administrator* access rights can still
create and edit entries if an `exception is configured
<accounting/year-end/lock-date-exception>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

#### Lock everything date {#accounting/year-end/lock-everything-date}

Setting a lock date prevents modifications to any posted journal entries
with an accounting date on or before the lock date. It also prevents
posting new entries with an accounting date on or before the lock date.
In such cases, the system automatically sets the accounting date to the
day after the lock date.

To set a `Lock Everything`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} date, go
to `Accounting --> Accounting --> Lock
Dates`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. In the
`Lock Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window, set
the `Lock Everything`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} date and
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

After setting the `Lock Everything`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
date, an `exception
<accounting/year-end/lock-date-exception>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
can be made if a modification is necessary.

##### Lock date exception {#accounting/year-end/lock-date-exception}

Users with
`Administrator <accounting/accountant-access-rights>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} access rights to the Accounting app can create exceptions.
To do so:

1.  After setting and saving a lock date, go to
    `Accounting --> Accounting --> Lock
    Dates`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. In the
    `Lock Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window,
    remove the `Lock Everything`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    date.
2.  In the `Exception`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner, choose
    if this exception should be set `for me`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} (the current user) or
    `for everyone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and how long it
    should last.
3.  A `Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for this exception can
    be added.
4.  All of this information is logged in the chatter of the
    `company record
    </applications/general/companies>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To remove a lock date after it has been saved, configure the exception
to apply `for
everyone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and set the duration to
`forever`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This does not apply to the
`Hard Lock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} date, which is
irreversible to ensure inalterability and to meet accounting
requirements in certain countries.
::::

#### Current year\'s earnings {#accounting/year-end/current-year-earnings}

Odoo uses a unique account type called **current year\'s earnings** to
display the difference between the **income** and **expense** accounts.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The chart of accounts can only contain one account of this type. By
default, it is a 999999 account named
`Undistributed Profits/Losses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

To allocate the current year\'s earnings, create a new miscellaneous
entry with a date set to the end of the fiscal year to book them to any
equity account.

Then, verify whether the current year\'s earnings on the **balance
sheet** correctly show a zero balance. If so, a
`Hard Lock date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be set to the
last day of the fiscal year in
`Accounting --> Accounting --> Lock Dates`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The `Hard Lock date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
irreversible and is intended to ensure data inalterability required to
comply with accounting regulations in certain countries. If such
compliance is not applicable, setting this field may not be necessary.
However, if required, the date should only be set once it is confirmed
to be correct, as it **cannot be changed or overridden**, regardless of
access rights.

## Annual closing {#accounting/year-end/annual-closing}

To complete the fiscal year-end process and finalize the annual closing,
go to the Accounting dashboard and click `Tax Returns`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the `Tax Returns`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
journal from the Accounting dashboard. Alternatively, go to
`Accounting --> Accounting --> Tax
Returns`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

This view displays a chronological list of all pending returns including
`tax returns
<accounting/tax-returns/vat-report>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`advance payments
<accounting/tax-returns/advance-payments>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
(based on the `fiscal localization
<../../fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}), and annual
closings. A pending `Annual Closing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
follows two steps:
`review <accounting/year-end/annual-closing/review>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `submit
<accounting/year-end/annual-closing/submit>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. The `Annual Closing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
item includes:

- A period (year).
- A deadline date.
- The related company and
  `branch(es) <general/branches>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, if
  applicable.
- Action steps, such as
  `Review <accounting/year-end/annual-closing/review>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} and `Submit
  <accounting/year-end/annual-closing/submit>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, which turn green when completed.
- Action buttons for key tasks.
- A `fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(vertical ellipsis)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu for
  additional options.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Before the annual closing is reviewed, the number of
`Pending`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Passed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} closing validation checks is
displayed in red or green, respectively. - If the
`Deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} date has passed, it
appears in red.
::::

### Review {#accounting/year-end/annual-closing/review}

To start reviewing an annual closing, click the annual closing line. The
annual closing checks view displays the following, depending on the
`fiscal localization <../../fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}:

> - `Aged payables per partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
>   Review payables without a partner.
> - `Aged receivables per partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
>   Review receivables without a partner.
> - `Bank Reconciliation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Reconcile
>   all bank account transactions up to year-end.
> - `Deferred Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Ensure start
>   and end dates are correctly set on bills and invoices.
> - `Earnings Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: After
>   adjustments, transfer the undistributed profits/losses to an equity
>   account.
> - `Fixed Assets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Ensure assets are
>   properly registered for automatic depreciation calculation.
> - `Loans`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Ensure loans are
>   properly registered for automatic amortization calculations.
> - `Manual Adjustments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Complete
>   any necessary manual adjustments and internal checks.
> - `No draft entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Review and
>   post draft invoices, bills, and entries in the period, or change
>   their accounting date.
> - `Overdue payables`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Review
>   overdue payables aged over 60 days and assess the need for an
>   allowance for uncertain liabilities.
> - `Overdue receivables`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Review
>   overdue receivables aged over 60 days and assess the need for an
>   allowance for doubtful accounts or expected credit loss provision,
>   as per IFRS 9 guidelines.
> - `Total Receivables`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Verify that
>   the total aged receivables equals the customer account balance.
> - `Total payables`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Verify that the
>   total aged payables equals the vendor account balance.

Some of the checks are performed automatically, while others serve as
reminders to review essential tasks. Each check card is either labeled
as:

- `Reviewed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (highlighted in green):
  The check has passed.
- `To review`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (highlighted in grey):
  Action is required before the check can be manually marked as
  `Reviewed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Supervised`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Anomaly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (highlighted in red): The
  automatic check detects an issue. There are two options:
  - Click the failed check\'s card to fix the issue.
  - Click `Anomaly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select
    `Reviewed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `Supervised`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to pass the check
    without fixing the issue.

Once all closing validation checks have passed, either labeled as
`Reviewed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Supervised`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to complete the
`Review`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} step. The annual closing can
then be
`submitted <accounting/year-end/annual-closing/submit>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

:::: tip

\- To add customized checks, activate
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and go
to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Check`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and complete the necessary fields. - All check status
changes are logged in the chatter.
::::

### Submit {#accounting/year-end/annual-closing/submit}

Once a tax return has completed the
`Review <accounting/tax-returns/vat-return-review>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} step, click `Submit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If a `Submission Instructions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window appears, depending on the `fiscal

# B2B (tax excluded) and B2C (tax included) pricing

When working with consumers, prices are usually expressed with taxes
included in the price (e.g., in most eCommerce). But, when you work in a
B2B environment, companies usually negotiate prices with taxes excluded.

Odoo manages both use cases easily, as long as you register your prices
on the product with taxes excluded or included, but not both together.
If you manage all your prices with tax included (or excluded) only, you
can still easily do sales order with a price having taxes excluded (or
included) : that\'s easy.

This documentation is only for the specific use case where you need to
have two references for the price (tax included or excluded), for the
same product. The reason of the complexity is that there is not a
symmetrical relationship with prices included and prices excluded, as
shown in this use case, in Belgium with a tax of 21%:

- Your eCommerce has a product at **10€ (taxes included)**
- This would do **8.26€ (taxes excluded)** and a **tax of 1.74€**

But for the same use case, if you register the price without taxes on
the product form (8.26€), you get a price with tax included at 9.99€,
because:

- **8.26€ \* 1.21 = 9.99€**

So, depending on how you register your prices on the product form, you
will have different results for the price including taxes and the price
excluding taxes:

- Taxes Excluded: **8.26€ & 10.00€**
- Taxes Included: **8.26€ & 9.99€**

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If you buy 100 pieces at 10€ taxes included, it gets even more tricky.
You will get: **1000€ (taxes included) = 826.45€ (price) + 173.55€
(taxes)** Which is very different from a price per piece at 8.26€ tax
excluded.
::::

This documentation explains how to handle the very specific use case
where you need to handle the two prices (tax excluded and included) on
the product form within the same company.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In terms of finance, you have no more revenues selling your product at
10€ instead of 9.99€ (for a 21% tax), because your revenue will be
exactly the same at 9.99€, only the tax is 0.01€ higher. So, if you run
an eCommerce in Belgium, make your customer a favor and set your price
at 9.99€ instead of 10€. Please note that this does not apply to 20€ or
30€, or other tax rates, or a quantity \>1. You will also make you a
favor since you can manage everything tax excluded, which is less error
prone and easier for your salespeople.
::::

## Configuration

### Introduction

The best way to avoid this complexity is to choose only one way of
managing your prices and stick to it: price without taxes or price with
taxes included. Define which one is the default stored on the product
form (on the default tax related to the product), and let Odoo compute
the other one automatically, based on the pricelist and fiscal position.
Negotiate your contracts with customers accordingly. This perfectly
works out-of-the-box and you have no specific configuration to do.

If you can not do that and if you really negotiate some prices with tax
excluded and, for other customers, others prices with tax included, you
must:

1.  always store the default price **tax excluded** on the product form,
    and apply a tax (price excluded on the product form)
2.  create a pricelist with prices in **tax included**, for specific
    customers
3.  create a fiscal position that switches the tax excluded to a tax
    included
4.  assign both the pricelist and the fiscal position to customers who
    want to benefit to this pricelist and fiscal position

For the purpose of this documentation, we will use the above use case:

- your product default sale price is 8.26€ tax excluded
- but we want to sell it at 10€, tax included, in our shops or eCommerce
  website

### Setting your products

Your company must be configured with tax excluded by default. This is
usually the default configuration, but you can check your **Default Sale
Tax** from the menu `Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} of the Accounting application.

![image](B2B_B2C/price_B2C_B2B01.png){.align-center}

Once done, you can create a **B2C** pricelist. You can activate the
pricelist feature per customer from the menu:
`Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} of
the Sale application. Choose the option **different prices per customer
segment**.

Once done, create a B2C pricelist from the menu
`Configuration --> Pricelists`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
It\'s also good to rename the default pricelist into B2B to avoid
confusion.

Then, create a product at 8.26€, with a tax of 21% (defined as tax not
included in price) and set a price on this product for B2C customers at
10€, from the `Sales --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} menu of the Sales application:

![image](B2B_B2C/price_B2C_B2B02.png){.align-center}

### Setting the B2C fiscal position

From the accounting application, create a B2C fiscal position from this
menu: `Configuration --> Fiscal Positions`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. This fiscal position should map the VAT 21% (tax
excluded of price) with a VAT 21% (tax included in price)

![image](B2B_B2C/price_B2C_B2B03.png){.align-center}

## Test by creating a quotation

Create a quotation from the Sale application, using the
`Sales --> Quotations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} menu. You
should have the following result: 8.26€ + 1.73€ = 9.99€.

![image](B2B_B2C/price_B2C_B2B04.png){.align-center}

Then, create a quotation but **change the pricelist to B2C and the
fiscal position to B2C** on the quotation, before adding your product.
You should have the expected result, which is a total price of 10€ for
the customer: 8.26€ + 1.74€ = 10.00€.

![image](B2B_B2C/price_B2C_B2B05.png){.align-center}

This is the expected behavior for a customer of your shop.

## Avoid changing every sale order

If you negotiate a contract with a customer, whether you negotiate tax
included or tax excluded, you can set the pricelist and the fiscal
position on the customer form so that it will be applied automatically
at every sale of this customer.

The pricelist is in the **Sales & Purchases** tab of the customer form,
and the fiscal position is in the accounting tab.

Note that this is error prone: if you set a fiscal position with tax
included in prices but use a pricelist that is not included, you might
have wrong prices calculated for you. That\'s why we usually recommend
companies to only work with one price reference.

# AvaTax use

AvaTax is a tax calculation software that can be integrated with Odoo in
the United States and Canada. Once the
`integration setup <../avatax>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} is
complete, the calculated tax is simple and automatic.

## Tax calculation {#accounting/avatax/tax-calculation}

Automatically calculate taxes on Odoo quotations and invoices with
AvaTax by confirming the documents during the sales flow. Alternatively,
calculate the taxes manually by clicking the
`Compute Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, while these
documents are in draft stage.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Clicking the `Compute Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
recalculates taxes, if any product lines are edited on the invoice.
::::

![Sales quotation with the confirm and compute taxes button highlighted.](avatax_use/calculate-avatax.png){.align-center}

The tax calculation is triggered during the following `automatic trigger
<avatax/automatic-triggers>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`manual trigger <avatax/manual-triggers>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
circumstances.

### Automatic triggers {#avatax/automatic-triggers}

- When the sales rep sends the quote by email with
  `Send by email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button (pop-up).
- When the customer views the online quote on the portal.
- When a quote is confirmed and becomes a sales order.
- When the customer views the invoice on the portal.
- When a draft invoice is validated.
- When the customer views the subscription in the portal.
- When a subscription generates an invoice.
- When the customer gets to the last screen of the eCommerce checkout.

### Manual triggers {#avatax/manual-triggers}

- `Compute Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the
  bottom of the quote.
- `Compute Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top
  of the invoice.

Use each of these buttons to manually re-calculate the sales tax.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Use the `Avalara Partner Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
that is available on customer records, quotations, and invoices to
cross-reference data in Odoo and AvaTax. This field is located under the
`Other info`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} tab of the sales
order or quotation in the `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section.

On the customer record, navigate to *Contacts app* and select a contact.
Then open the `Sales & Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
and the `Avalara Partner Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under
the `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Automatic Tax Mapping (AvaTax)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
fiscal position is also applied on those Odoo documents, like
subscriptions.
::::

::: seealso
\- `../fiscal_positions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## AvaTax synchronization

Synchronization occurs with AvaTax, when the *invoice* is created in
Odoo. This means the sales tax is recorded with Avalara (AvaTax software
developer).

To do so, navigate to
`Sales app --> Orders --> Quotations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select a quotation from the list.

After confirming a quotation and validating the delivery, click
`Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Indicate whether it
is a `Regular invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Down payment (percentage)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Down payment (fixed amount)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then click `Create and view invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
The recorded taxes can be seen in the `Journal Items`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of the invoice. There will be different taxes
depending on the location of the `Delivery Address`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Journal items highlighted on a invoice in Odoo.](avatax_use/journal-items.png){.align-center}

Finally, press the `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
to complete the invoice and synchronize with the AvaTax portal.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

An invoice cannot be `Reset to draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
because this causes de-synchronization with the AvaTax Portal. Instead,
click `Add credit note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and state:
[Sync with AvaTax Portal]{.title-ref}. See this documentation:
`../../../accounting/customer_invoices/credit_notes`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
::::

## Fixed price discounts

Add a fixed price discount to a valuable customer, by clicking
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the customer\'s
invoice. Add the product discount, and set the `Price`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to either a positive or negative value. To recalculate
the taxes, click `Compute Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Tax calculation can even be done on negative subtotals and credit notes.
::::

## Logging

It is possible to log Avalara/\*AvaTax\* actions in Odoo for further
analysis, or verification of functionality. Logging is accessible
through the *AvaTax* settings.

To start logging *AvaTax* actions, first, navigate to the
`Accounting app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Then, in the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, under
the `AvaTax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} settings, click
`Start logging for 30 minutes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Upon starting the log process, Odoo will log all Avalara/\*AvaTax\*
actions performed in the database.

To view the logs, click on `Show logs`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to the right of the `Start logging for 30
minutes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This reveals a detailed
list of Avalara/\*AvaTax\* actions. This list is sortable by the
following columns:

- `Created on`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: timestamp of the
  *AvaTax* calculation.
- `Created by`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: numeric value of the
  user in the database.
- `Database name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: name of the
  database.
- `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: two values can be chosen
  for this field, `Server`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Client`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Avalara service name. In
  this case, it will be *AvaTax*.
- `Level`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: by default, this will be
  [INFO]{.title-ref}.
- `Path`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: indicates the path taken to
  make the calculation.
- `Line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: indicates the line the
  calculation is made on.
- `Function`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: indicates the
  calculation taken on the line.

![Avalara logging page with top row of list highlighted.](avatax_use/logging.png){.align-center}

Click into the log line to reveal another field, called
`Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

This field populates a raw transcription of the transaction, which
involves the creation (or adjustment) of a sales invoice using the
Avalara *AvaTax* API.

The transaction includes details, such as addresses for shipping from
and to, line items describing the products or services, tax codes, tax
amounts, and other relevant information.

The `Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} contains the calculated
taxes for different jurisdictions and confirms the creation (or
adjustment) of the transaction.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Custom fields can be made using Odoo *Studio*. Click the
`fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(ellipsis)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu to the far-right of
the header row. Then click `fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Add custom field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This action opens
Odoo *Studio*.
::::

# AvaTax integration

Avalara\'s *AvaTax* is a cloud-based tax software. Integrating *AvaTax*
with Odoo provides real-time and region-specific tax calculations when
users sell, purchase, and invoice items in Odoo. *AvaTax* tax
calculation is supported with every United Nations charted country,
including inter-border transactions.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

*AvaTax* is only available for integration with databases/companies that
have locations in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. This means the
fiscal position/country of a database can only be set to the United
States, Canada, or Brazil. For more information, reference this
documentation: `accounting/avatax/fiscal_country`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

*AvaTax* accounts for location-based tax rates for each state, county,
and city. It improves remittance accuracy by paying close attention to
laws, rules, jurisdiction boundaries, and special circumstances (like,
tax holidays, and product exemptions). Companies who integrate with
*AvaTax* can maintain control of tax-calculations in-house with this
simple `API (application
programming interface)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} integration.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Some limitations exist in Odoo while using AvaTax for tax calculation:

- AvaTax uses the company address by default. To use the warehouse
  address, enable `Allow
  Ship Later <../../../sales/point_of_sale/shop/ship_later>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} in the **POS** app settings.
- Excise tax is **not** supported. This includes tobacco/vape taxes,
  fuel taxes, and other specific industries.
::::

::: seealso
Avalara\'s support documents: [About
AvaTax](https://community.avalara.com/support/s/document-item?language=en_US)
:::

## Set up on AvaTax

To use *AvaTax*, an account with Avalara is required for the setup. If
one has not been set up yet, connect with Avalara to purchase a license:
[Avalara: Let\'s Talk](https://www.avalara.com/us/en/get-started.html).

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Upon account setup, take note of the *AvaTax*
`Account ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This will be needed in
the `Odoo setup <accounting/avatax/credentials>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. In Odoo, this number is the `API
ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

Then, [create a basic company profile](https://www.odoo.com/r/2k0).

### Create basic company profile

Collect essential business details for the next step: locations where
tax is collected, products/services sold (and their sales locations),
and customer tax exemptions, if applicable. Follow the Avalara
documentation for creating a basic company profile:

1.  [Add company information](https://www.odoo.com/r/XZDW).
2.  [Tell us where the company collects and pays
    tax](https://www.odoo.com/r/E6g).
3.  [Verify jurisdictions and activate the
    company](https://www.odoo.com/r/NIy).
4.  [Add other company locations for location-based
    filing](https://www.odoo.com/r/GF4).
5.  [Add a marketplace to the company
    profile](https://www.odoo.com/r/QA5).

### Connect to AvaTax {#accounting/avatax/create_avalara_credentials}

After creating the basic company profile in Avalara, connect to
*AvaTax*. This step links Odoo and *AvaTax* bidirectionally.

Navigate to either Avalara\'s
[sandbox](https://sandbox.admin.avalara.com/) or
[production](https://admin.avalara.com/) environment. This will depend
on which type of Avalara account the company would like to integrate.

::: seealso

Generating a new license key breaks the connection with existing
business apps using the *AvaTax* integration. Make sure to update these
apps with the new license key.
::::

If this will be the first
`API (application programming interface)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
integration being made with *AvaTax* and Odoo, then click
`Generate license key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If this is an additional license key, ensure the previous connection can
be broken. There is **only** one license key associated with each of the
Avalara sandbox and production accounts.

## Odoo configuration {#accounting/avatax/odoo-configuration}

Before using *AvaTax*, there are some additional configurations in Odoo
to ensure tax calculations are made accurately.

Verify that the Odoo database contains necessary data. The country
initially set up in the database determines the fiscal position, and
aids *AvaTax* in calculating accurate tax rates.

### Fiscal country {#accounting/avatax/fiscal_country}

To set the `Fiscal Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, navigate
to `Accounting app --> Configuration
--> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

::: seealso
`../../fiscal_localizations`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

Under the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, set the
`Fiscal Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature to `United
States`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Canada`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Brazil`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then,
click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Company settings

All companies operating under the Odoo database should have a full and
complete address listed in the settings. Navigate to the
`Settings app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and under the
`Companies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, ensure there is
only one company operating the Odoo database. Click
`Update Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open a separate page
to update company details.

If there are multiple companies operating in the database, click
`Manage Companies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to load a list of
companies to select from. Update company information by clicking into
the specific company.

Database administrators should ensure that the
`Street...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Street2...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `State`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are all updated for the
companies.

This ensures accurate tax calculations and smooth end-of-year accounting
operations.

### Odoo AvaTax settings {#accounting/avatax/credentials}

To integrate the *AvaTax*
`API (application programming interface)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
with Odoo, go to
`Accounting app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} section. The `AvaTax`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} fields in the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section is where the *AvaTax* configurations are made,
and the credentials are entered in.

First, tick the checkbox to the left of the `AvaTax`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} settings, to activate *AvaTax* on the database. This is
a quick, convenient way to activate and deactivate *AvaTax* tax
calculation on the Odoo database.

![Configure AvaTax settings](avatax/avatax-configuration-settings.png){.align-center}

#### Prerequisites {#accounting/avatax/prerequisites}

First, select the `Environment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
which the company wishes to use *AvaTax* in. It can either be
`Sandbox`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
For help determining which *AvaTax* environment to use (either
`Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Sandbox`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), visit: [Sandbox vs
Production
environments](https://knowledge.avalara.com/bundle/fzc1692293626742/page/sandbox-vs-production.html).
:::

#### Credentials

Now, the credentials can be entered in. The *AvaTax*
`Account ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should be entered in the
`API ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and the
`License Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should be entered in
the `API
Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Account ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be found by
logging into the *AvaTax* portal
([sandbox](https://sandbox.admin.avalara.com/) or
[production](https://admin.avalara.com/)). In the upper-right corner,
click on the initials of the user and `Account`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The `Account ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
listed first.

To access the `License Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} see this
documentation:
`accounting/avatax/create_avalara_credentials`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

For the `Company Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, enter
the Avalara company code for the company being configured. Avalara
interprets this as [DEFAULT]{.title-ref}, if it is not set. The
`Company Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be accessed in the
Avalara management portal.

First, log into the *AvaTax* portal
([sandbox](https://sandbox.admin.avalara.com/) or
[production](https://admin.avalara.com/)). Then, navigate to
`Settings --> Manage Companies`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
The `Company Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} value is located
in the row of the `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Company Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

![AvaTax company code highlighted on the company details page.](avatax/company-code.png){.align-center}

#### Transaction options

There are two transactional settings in the Odoo *AvaTax* settings that
can be configured: `Use UPC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Commit Transactions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If the checkbox next to `Use UPC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
ticked, the transactions will use Universal Product Codes (UPC), instead
of custom defined codes in Avalara. Consult a certified public
accountant (CPA) for specific guidance.

Should the `Commit Transactions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox be ticked, then, the transactions in the Odoo database will be
committed for reporting in *AvaTax*.

#### Address validation

The *Address Validation* feature ensures that the most up-to-date
address by postal standards is set on a contact in Odoo. This is
important to provide accurate tax calculations for customers.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Address Validation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature only
works with partners/customers in North America.
::::

Additionally, tick the checkbox next to the
`Address validation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

For accurate tax calculations, it is best practice to enter a complete
address for the contacts saved in the database. However, *AvaTax* can
still function by implementing a best effort attempt using only the
`Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `State`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `Zip code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
These are the three minimum required fields.
::::

`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the settings to implement the
configuration.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Manually `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the address by
navigating to the `Contacts app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and selecting a contact. Now that the *AvaTax*
module has been configured on the database, a
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button appears directly
below the `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a pop-up window
appears with a `Validated Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Original Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} listed. If the
`Validated Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is the correct
mailing address for tax purposes, click
`Save Validated`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Validate address pop-up window in Odoo with \"Save Validated\" button and \"Validated
Address\" highlighted.](avatax/validate-address.png){.align-center}
::::

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

All previously-entered addresses for contacts in the Odoo database will
need to be validated using the manually validate process outlined above.
Addresses are not automatically validated if they were entered
previously. This only occurs upon tax calculation.
::::

#### Test connection

After entering all the above information into the *AvaTax* setup on
Odoo, click `Test
connection`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This ensures the
`API ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`API KEY`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are correct, and a
connection is made between Odoo and the *AvaTax* application programming
interface (API).

#### Sync parameters

Upon finishing the configuration and settings of the *AvaTax* section,
click the `Sync
Parameters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. This action
synchronizes the exemption codes from *AvaTax*.

### Fiscal position {#accounting/avatax/fiscal_positions}

Next, navigate to
`Accounting app --> Configuration --> Accounting: Fiscal
Positions`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. A
`Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is listed named,
`Automatic Tax Mapping
(AvaTax)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click it to open
*AvaTax\'s* fiscal position configuration page.

Here, ensure that the `Use AvaTax API`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox is ticked.

Optionally, tick the checkbox next to the field labeled:
`Detect Automatically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Should this
option be ticked, then, Odoo will automatically apply this
`Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for transactions in
Odoo.

Enabling `Detect Automatically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} also
makes specific parameters, such as `VAT
required`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Foreign Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Country Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Federal States`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Zip Range`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appear. Filling these
parameters filters the `Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} usage. Leaving them blank ensures all calculations are
made using this `Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Should the `Detect Automatically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox not be ticked, each customer will need to have the
`Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set on their
`Sales and Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
contact record. To do so, navigate to
`Sales app --> Order --> Customers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, or `Contacts app --> Contacts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, select a customer or contact to set the
fiscal position on.

Navigate to the `Sales and Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, and down to the section labeled,
`Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Set the
`Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to the fiscal
position for the customer.
::::

::: seealso
`fiscal_positions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

#### AvaTax accounts

Upon selecting the checkbox option for
`Use AvaTax API`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} a new
`AvaTax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab appears. Click into this
tab to reveal two different settings.

The first setting is the `AvaTax Invoice Account`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, while the second is, `AvaTax
Refund Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Ensure both accounts
are set for smooth end-of-year record keeping. Consult a certified
public accountant (CPA) for specific guidance on setting both accounts.

Click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to implement the
changes.

### Tax mapping

The *AvaTax* integration is available on sale orders and invoices with
the included *AvaTax* fiscal position.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Additionally, there is a `Tax Mapping`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab and `Account Mapping`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab in the
`Automatic Tax Mapping (AvaTax)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
fiscal position, where mapping for products can also be configured. To
access `Fiscal Positions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} navigate to
`Accounting app
--> Configuration --> Accounting: Fiscal Positions`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

#### Product category mapping

Before using the integration, specify an
`Avatax Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the product
categories. Navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Product Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select the product category to add the
`AvaTax Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to. In the
`AvaTax Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select a
category from the drop-down menu, or `Search More...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to open the complete list of options.

![Specify AvaTax Category on products.](avatax/avatax-category.png){.align-center}

#### Product mapping

*AvaTax* Categories may be set on individual products, as well. To set
the `Avatax
Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} navigate to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select the product to add the
`Avatax Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to. Under the
`General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, on the
far-right, is a selector field labeled:
`Avatax Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Finally, click the
drop-down menu, and select a category, or
`Search More...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to find one that is
not listed.

:::: note

# Cash basis taxes

Cash basis taxes are due when the payment is made, as opposed to
standard taxes that are due when the invoice is confirmed. Reporting
your income and expenses to the government based on the cash basis
method is mandatory in some countries and under some conditions.

::: example
You sell a product in the 1st quarter of your fiscal year, and the
payment is received in the 2nd quarter. Based on the cash basis method,
the tax you must pay is for the 2nd quarter.
:::

## Configuration

Go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and under the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, enable `Cash Basis`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Then, define the `Tax Cash Basis Journal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Click on the external link button next to the journal
to update its default properties such as the
`Journal Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Short Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Select your Tax Cash Basis Journal and click on the external link](cash_basis/tax_cash_basis_journal.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

By default, the journal entries of the
`Cash Basis Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} journal are named
using the `CABA`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} short code.
::::

Once this is done, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Accounting: Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to configure your taxes. You can either
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} a new tax or update an
existing one by clicking on it.

The `Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column reflects the
proper transitional accounts to post taxes until the payment is
registered.

![Fill in the account column with a transitional accounts where taxes go until the payment
is registered](cash_basis/account_column.png){.align-center}

In the `Advanced Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, decide
of the `Tax Exigilibity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Select
`Based on Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, so the tax is due
when the payment of the invoice is received. You can then also define
the `Cash Basis Transition Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
where the tax amount is recorded as long as the original invoice has not
been reconciled.

![Fill in the Cash Basis Transition Account where taxes amounts go until payment
reconciliation.](cash_basis/advanced_options.png){.align-center}

## Impact of cash basis taxes on accounting

To illustrate the impact of cash basis taxes on accounting transactions,
let\'s take an example with the sales of a product that costs 1,000\$,
with a cash basis tax of 15%.

![](cash_basis/customer_invoice_with_cbt.png){.align-center}

The following entries are created in your accounting, and the tax report
is currently empty.

+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Customer journal (INV)**                                  |
+==============================+==============================+
| **Debit**                    | **Credit**                   |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
| Receivable \$1,150           |                              |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
|                              | Income \$1,000               |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
|                              | Temporary tax account \$150  |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+

When the payment is then received, it is registered as below :

+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Bank journal (BANK)**                                     |
+==============================+==============================+
| **Debit**                    | **Credit**                   |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
| Bank \$1,150                 |                              |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
|                              | Receivable \$1,150           |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Once the payment is registered, you can use the
`Cash Basis Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button on
the invoice to access them directly.
::::

Finally, upon reconciliation of the invoice with the payment, the below
entry is automatically created:

+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Tax Cash Basis Journal (Caba)**                           |
+==============================+==============================+
| **Debit**                    | **Credit**                   |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
| Income account \$1,000       |                              |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
| Temporary tax account \$150  |                              |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
|                              | > Income account \$1,000     |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
|                              | Tax Received \$150           |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+

The journal items `Income account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
vs. `Income account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are neutral, but
they are needed to ensure correct tax reports in Odoo with accurate base
tax amounts.

Using a default `Base Tax Received Account`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is recommended so your balance is at zero and your
income account is not polluted by unnecessary accounting movements. To
do so, go to `Configuration --> Settings --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a
`Base Tax Received Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under
`Cash Basis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

goods and services from vendors registered for VAT purposes to
individuals (B2C) located in a European Union member state. The
transaction is conducted remotely, typically through online platforms,
mail orders, telephone, or other means of communication.

EU intra-community distance selling is subject to specific VAT rules and
regulations. The vendor must charge VAT per the VAT rate applicable in
the buyer\'s country.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This remains applicable even if the vendor is located outside of the
European Union.
::::

## Configuration

The **EU Intra-community Distance Selling** feature helps you comply
with this regulation by creating and configuring new **fiscal
positions** and **taxes** based on your company\'s country. To enable
it, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, tick
`EU Intra-community Distance Selling`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## One-Stop Shop (OSS)

The `OSS (One-Stop Shop)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} system
introduced by the European Union simplifies VAT collection for
**cross-border** sales of goods and services. It primarily applies to
business-to-consumer **(B2C)** cases. With the OSS, businesses can
register for VAT in their home country and use a single online portal to
handle VAT obligations for their sales within the EU. There are **two
primary schemes**: the **Union OSS** scheme for cross-border services
and the **Import OSS** scheme for goods valued at or below €150.

### Reports

To generate **OSS sales** or **OSS imports** reports and submit them
onto the OSS portal, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click `Report: Generic Tax
report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select either
`OSS Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`OSS Imports`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Once selected, click
on `PDF`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `XLSX`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `XML`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
top-left corner. This generates the currently-opened report in the
selected format. Once generated, log into the platform of your competent
federal authority to submit it onto the OSS portal.

# Fiscal positions (tax and account mapping)

Default taxes and accounts are set on products and customers to create
new transactions on the fly. However, depending on the customers\' and
vendors\' location and business type, using different taxes and accounts
for a transaction might be necessary.

**Fiscal positions** allow the creation of rules to adapt the taxes and
the income and expense accounts used for a transaction automatically.

They can be applied
`automatically <fiscal_positions/automatic>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `manually
<fiscal_positions/manual>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, or
`assigned to a partner <fiscal_positions/partner>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Several default fiscal positions are available as part of your
`fiscal localization
package <fiscal_localizations/packages>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

## Configuration {#fiscal_positions/configuration}

To edit or create a fiscal position, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Fiscal
Positions`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and open the record
to modify or click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If any notes are legally required when using this fiscal position, add
them in the `Legal Notes...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
below the `tax mapping <fiscal_positions/tax-mapping>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} section to display them on quotations, sales orders,
invoices, and bills.
::::

### Tax mapping {#fiscal_positions/tax-mapping}

Fiscal positions are required to map taxes.
`Tax mapping <taxes/tax-mapping>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is
configured on taxes themselves.

### Account mapping {#fiscal_positions/account-mapping}

Account mapping is based on the income and expense accounts defined on
the product or product category. To map to another account, select the
account to be replaced in the left column
(`Account on Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) and select the
account to use instead in the right column
(`Account to Use Instead`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

![Example of a fiscal position\'s account mapping](fiscal_positions/fiscal-positions-account-mapping.png)

## Application

### Automatic application {#fiscal_positions/automatic}

To automatically apply a fiscal position following a set of conditions,
go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Fiscal Positions`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, open the fiscal position to modify, and tick
`Detect Automatically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

From there, several conditions can be activated:

- `VAT Required`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the customer\'s VAT
  number must be present on their contact form.
- `Country Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the fiscal position is
  only applied to the selected country or country group.

![Example of a fiscal position automatic application settings](fiscal_positions/fiscal-positions-automatic.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- If the `Verify VAT Numbers <vat_verification>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} feature is enabled, any fiscal positions with
`VAT required`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} enabled will require
Intra-Community valid VAT numbers to apply automatically. - Taxes on
**eCommerce orders** are automatically updated once the customer has
logged in or filled out their billing details.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The fiscal positions\' **sequence** defines which fiscal position is
applied if all conditions set on multiple fiscal positions are met
simultaneously.

For example, suppose the first fiscal position in a sequence targets
*country A* while the second fiscal position targets a *country group*
that comprises *country A*. In that case, only the first fiscal position
will be applied to customers from *country A*.
::::

### Manual application {#fiscal_positions/manual}

To manually select a fiscal position, open a sales order, purchase
order, invoice, or bill, go to the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab and select the desired
`Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} before adding
product lines.

![Selection of a fiscal position on a sales order, invoice, or bill](fiscal_positions/fiscal-positions-manual.png)

### Assign to a partner {#fiscal_positions/partner}

To define which fiscal position must be used by default for a specific
partner, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Customers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select the partner, open the
`Sales & Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and select
the `Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Selection of a fiscal position on a customer](fiscal_positions/fiscal-positions-customer.png)

# Withholding taxes

A **withholding tax**, also known as retention tax, mandates the payer
of a customer invoice to deduct a tax from the payment and remit it to
the government. Typically, a tax is included in the subtotal to
calculate the total amount paid, while withholding taxes are directly
subtracted from the payment.

## Configuration

In Odoo, a withholding tax is defined by creating a negative tax. To
create one, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and, in the `Amount`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, enter a negative amount.

![negative tax amount in field](retention/negative-amount.png)

Then, go to the `Advanced Options`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} tab and create a retention
`Tax Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![tax group for retention tax.](retention/tax-group.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If the retention is a percentage of a regular tax, create a
`Tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with a
`Tax Computation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as a
`Group of Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, set both the
regular tax and the retention one in the `Definition`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.
::::

## Retention taxes on invoices

Once the retention tax has been created, it can be used on customer
forms, sales orders, and customer invoices. Several taxes can be applied
on a single customer invoice line.

# Tax computation

## Tax computation {#taxes/computation}

The `Tax Computation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
determines the relation between the tax amount and the base the tax is
based on. The following options are available:

- `Group of Taxes <taxes/computation/group-of-taxes>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: a combination of several other taxes
- `Fixed <taxes/computation/fixed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}: a
  fixed amount
- `Percentage of Price <taxes/computation/percentage-of-price>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: a percentage of the tax-excluded sales price
- `Percentage of Price Tax Included <taxes/computation/percentage-of-price-tax-included>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: a percentage of the tax-included total
- `Custom Formula <taxes/computation/python-code>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: a custom, user-defined formula

### Group of taxes {#taxes/computation/group-of-taxes}

The tax is a combination of multiple sub-taxes. You can add as many
taxes as you want, in the order you want them to be applied.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Make sure the tax sequence is correct, as the display order determines
the application order and may affect tax computation, particularly if a
tax `affects the base of subsequent taxes
<taxes/base-subsequent>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

### Fixed {#taxes/computation/fixed}

The tax has a fixed amount in the default currency. The amount remains
the same per unit, regardless of the sales price.

The computation is
$\text{tax amount} = \text{fixed tax amount} \times \text{quantity}$.

::: example
A product has a sales price of \$1000, and we apply a \$10
`Fixed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tax. We then have:

  -------------------------------------------------
  Product sales Price without Tax        Total
  price         tax                      
  ------------- ------------- ---------- ----------
  1,000         1,000         10         1,010.00

  -------------------------------------------------
:::

### Percentage of price {#taxes/computation/percentage-of-price}

The tax rate is a percentage of the **tax-excluded** subtotal.

The exact tax computation depends on the
`Included in Price <taxes/included-in-price>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} field, which determines whether the tax amount is included
in the sales price.

:::::: tabs
.. tab:: Tax-excluded

If `Included in Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
`Tax Excluded`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the computation is
$\text{tax amount} = \text{sales price} \times \text{tax rate}$.

::: example
A product has a sales price of \$1000, and we apply a 10%
`Percentage of Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tax that is
`Tax Excluded`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. We then have:

  -------------------------------------------------
  Product sales Price without Tax        Total
  price         tax                      
  ------------- ------------- ---------- ----------
  1,000         1,000         100        1,100.00

  -------------------------------------------------
:::

::: tab
Tax-included
:::

If `Included in Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
`Tax Included`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the computation is
$\text{tax amount} = \text{sales price} \times \frac{\text{tax rate}}{1 +
\text{tax rate}}$.

::: example
A product has a sales price of \$1000, and we apply a 10%
`Percentage of Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tax that is
`Tax Included`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. We then have:

  -------------------------------------------------
  Product sales Price without Tax        Total
  price         tax                      
  ------------- ------------- ---------- ----------

  -------------------------------------------------
:::
::::::

### Percentage of price tax included {#taxes/computation/percentage-of-price-tax-included}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

This tax computation is rarely used and only useful in countries (e.g.,
Brazil, Bolivia) that quote tax rates as a percentage of the
tax-included total. For the more common need to compute tax amounts from
a tax-included price, use the
`Percentage of Price <taxes/computation/percentage-of-price>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} tax computation with
`Included in Price <taxes/included-in-price>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} set to `Tax Included`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

The tax rate is a percentage of the **tax-included** total.

The exact tax computation depends on the
`Included in Price <taxes/included-in-price>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} field, which determines whether the tax amount is included
in the sales price.

:::::: tabs
.. tab:: Tax-excluded If `Included in Price`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is set to `Tax Excluded`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, the computation is
$\text{tax amount} = \text{sales price} \times \frac{\text{tax rate}}{1 -
\text{tax rate}}$.

::: example
A product has a sales price of \$1000, and we apply a 10%
`Percentage of Price
Tax Included`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tax that is
`Tax Excluded`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. We then have:

  -------------------------------------------------
  Product sales Price without Tax        Total
  price         tax                      
  ------------- ------------- ---------- ----------
  1,000         1,000         111.11     1,111.11

  -------------------------------------------------

Note that the real tax rate in terms of the tax-excluded price is
$\frac{111.11}{1000} = 11.111\%$.
:::

::: tab
Tax-included
:::

If `Included in Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
`Tax Included`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the computation is
$\text{tax amount} = \text{sales price} \times \text{tax rate}$.

::: example
A product has a sales price of \$1000, and we apply a 10%
`Percentage of Price Tax Included`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tax that is `Tax Included`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. We then

  -------------------------------------------------
  Product sales Price without Tax        Total

### Custom formula {#taxes/computation/python-code}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If a tax can be expressed as a multiple of the quantity of the product
to which it applies, it can be defined as a
`Fixed <taxes/computation/fixed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} tax.
Doing so is strongly recommended over defining a
`Custom Formula`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tax.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To use `Custom Formula`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} taxes,
`install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the `Define
Taxes as Python Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
([account_python_tax]{.title-ref}) module.
::::

For a `Custom Formula`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tax, the tax
amount is computed according to a Python expression defined in the
`Formula`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. The Python
expression may contain the following tokens:

- any of the following variables:
  - \`price_unit\`: the unit price of the product
  - \`base\`: the taxable basis on which the tax is applied - may differ
    from the [price_unit]{.title-ref} if other taxes are applied first
  - \`quantity\`: the quantity of the product
  - \`product\`: the product record - product fields can also be
    accessed
- integers and floating-point numbers
- the following permitted tokens: [(]{.title-ref}, [)]{.title-ref},
  [+]{.title-ref}, [-]{.title-ref}, [\*]{.title-ref}, [/]{.title-ref},
  [,]{.title-ref}, [\<]{.title-ref}, [\>]{.title-ref},
  [\<=]{.title-ref}, [\>=]{.title-ref}, [and]{.title-ref},
  [or]{.title-ref}, [None]{.title-ref}, [min]{.title-ref}, and
  [max]{.title-ref}

::: example
A product has a sales price of \$1000, and we apply a
`Custom Formula`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tax with a
`Formula`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of [min(base, 500) \*
0.10 + max(base - 500, 0) \* 0.20]{.title-ref}

We then have:

  -------------------------------------------------
  Product sales Price without Tax        Total
  price         tax                      
  ------------- ------------- ---------- ----------

## Included in price {#taxes/included-in-price}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To set a company-wide default for this setting, go to `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
find the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and set the
`Prices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting to
`Tax Excluded`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Tax Included`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This setting cannot
be changed once invoices have been created.
::::

`Default`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} indicates that the tax
follows the company-wide default.

`Tax Excluded`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} indicates that the tax
amount is not included in the sales price. The tax computation will
therefore compute a tax amount on top of the sales price.

`Tax Included`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} indicates that the tax
amount is included in the sales price. The tax computation will
therefore split the sales price into a tax-excluded base and the tax
amount. This makes it suitable for B2C sales in most countries, where
prices are quoted tax-inclusive.

::: example
A product has a sales price of \$1000, and we apply a 10%
`Percentage of Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tax with
`Included in Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set to
`Tax Included`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. We then have:

  -------------------------------------------------
  Product sales Price without Tax        Total
  price         tax                      
  ------------- ------------- ---------- ----------

## Affect base of subsequent taxes {#taxes/base-subsequent}

This setting controls how multiple taxes on a product line affect each
other.

If this setting is enabled, this tax\'s tax amount is included in the
base of any subsequent tax applied on the same product line that has its
`taxes/base-affected`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} setting enabled. As
such, the subsequent tax\'s base is the sum of the tax-excluded base and
this tax\'s tax amount.

be based on a modified sales price equal to the original sales price
plus the tax amount.

::: title
Note
:::

The order in which taxes are applied depends only on the order in which
they appear in the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list, not
on the order in which they are added to a product line.

To modify the order, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and drag and drop taxes using the handles to the
left of the tax names.

![The order of appearance of taxes in the Taxes list determines which tax is applied first](tax_computation/list-sequence.png)

Regardless of the order in the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} list, `Tax Excluded`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
taxes do not affect the base of subsequent
`Tax Included`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} taxes (see the note in
`taxes/base-affected`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).
::::

::: example
In the following example:

- the Ecotax is a `Fixed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tax of
  €0.90 per unit, with the `Affect base of

  by preceding taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting
  enabled.
- In the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list, the 21% VAT
  tax comes after the Ecotax, as shown in the configuration above.

When applying both taxes to a product line, the Ecotax amount is added
to the basis of the 21% VAT tax.

European Union.

Odoo\'s VAT Validation feature uses the VIES to verify your contacts\'
VAT numbers directly from Odoo\'s interface.

:::: note

Regardless of whether or not the Verify VAT Numbers feature is enabled,
Odoo checks the format of a contact\'s VAT against the [expected format
of VAT numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAT_identification_number)
from that country.
::::

## VIES VAT number verification

To activate this feature, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. In the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section, enable the `Verify VAT Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} feature, and click on `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Once the `Verify VAT Numbers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature
is enabled, if the contact\'s `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field is populated *and* its country is different from
your company\'s country, Odoo displays an
`Intra-Community Valid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.
Odoo tests the VAT number through the VIES and automatically checks or
unchecks the `Intra-Community Valid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox depending on the validity of the VAT number.

![Intra-community valid checkbox on the contact record](vat_verification/intra-community-valid.png)

:::: important

It is possible to manually override the
`Intra-Community Valid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on a
contact in case the automatic VIES check is incorrect (for example, if
the company was recently created and its VAT is not yet in the VIES).
This change is logged in the chatter for transparency.

# Taxes

Tax regulations generally require companies to compute tax amounts on
sales, keep a record of accumulated tax debit and credit, and
periodically file this information in tax returns.

## Overview

In general, managing taxes in Odoo involves the following steps:

1.  Taxes are added on individual lines of documents created via the
    Sales, Purchase, Accounting, and Point of Sale apps.
2.  Odoo automatically computes tax amounts on the documents.
3.  On accounting documents, Odoo generates journal items to keep track
    of tax debit and tax credit.
4.  The total base, tax debit, and tax credit for a period can be viewed
    in the tax return report and used to file a tax return.

### Taxes on sales and purchases

Most sales and purchase documents have a `Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field where taxes can be applied to individual lines.
This includes `invoices <customer_invoices>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and `vendor bills
<vendor_bills>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} in the Accounting app,
`sales quotations <../../sales/sales/sales_quotations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} in the Sales app, and
`purchase orders <../../inventory_and_mrp/purchase/manage_deals/rfq>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} in the Purchase app.

![Adding a 21% tax on an invoice line.](taxes/invoice-tax.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When adding a product to a sale or purchase line, the taxes
`assigned to the product
<taxes/product>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are automatically applied
to the line.

In the `Point of Sale <../../sales/point_of_sale>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} app, the taxes `assigned to the
products <taxes/product>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are applied
directly to the order and cannot be changed except by a
`fiscal position <taxes/fiscal_positions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
::::

### Automatic computation of tax amounts

Applying a tax to a sale or purchase line allows Odoo to automatically
compute the tax amount based on the sale or purchase line\'s subtotal
and the tax\'s configuration. The details of the computation are
explained in the
`Tax Computation <taxes/tax_computation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
page.

![Odoo automatically computes a tax amount for the 21% tax.](taxes/invoice-tax-amount.png)

### Automatic generation of tax journal items

Upon applying a tax on an
`invoice <customer_invoices>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} or
`vendor bill <vendor_bills>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, a tax
payable journal item is automatically generated with the tax amount.
This keeps track of the tax debit or credit associated with the
transaction.

Furthermore, the tax amount is added to the amount due on the receivable
or payable journal item.

Finally,
`Tax Grids <accounting/tax-returns/tax-grids>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are added both to the automatically created tax payable
journal item and to the invoice line on which the tax is applied. These
tags are used to retrieve the journal items corresponding to the tax\'s
base and tax amount in the `Tax
Return <reporting/tax_returns>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} report.

![Odoo automatically generates a tax payable journal item for the 21% tax.](taxes/invoice-tax-items.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If `Cash Basis <taxes/cash_basis>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} is
enabled, upon reconciling the invoice or vendor bill with the payment,
an additional journal entry is created to represent the creation of the
tax debit or credit at that point in time.
::::

### Filing tax returns

The `Tax Return <reporting/tax_returns>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
report aggregates the base and tax amounts from invoices and vendor
bills over a given period and presents it in a format tailored to the
`fiscal localization <../fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

The amounts presented in the tax return report can be used to complete
tax declarations that need to be periodically submitted to the
government. In most cases, there is a one-to-one correspondence between
the lines of the tax return and the official tax declaration, allowing
amounts to simply be copied from one to the other.

![The base section of the tax return report for Belgium.](taxes/tax-return-base.png)

![The tax section of the tax return report for Belgium.](taxes/tax-return-tax.png)

## Basic tax configuration {#taxes/configuration}

Follow these basic steps to set up taxes:

1.  Enable any relevant
    `company-wide options <taxes/configuration/company>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
2.  Activate any needed
    `pre-configured taxes <taxes/list_activation>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
3.  Assign taxes on your `products <taxes/product>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

### Company-wide options {#taxes/configuration/company}

To access these configuration options, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration
--> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and scroll down to
`Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

#### Default taxes {#taxes/default}

The default `Sales Tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Purchase Tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are automatically set
on products when creating new products.

If `Accounting Firms <accounting/fiduciaries>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} mode is enabled, the default sales tax is automatically set
on new invoice lines, and the default purchase tax is automatically set
on new vendor bill lines.

`Prices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be changed to
`Tax Included`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to treat all taxes as
`tax
included <taxes/included-in-price>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} by
default. This would be appropriate if all of a company\'s pricing is
done tax-included. If only some of a company\'s pricing is tax-included,
individual taxes can be set as `Tax Included`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

#### EU intra-community distance selling

Activate this option if you are based in the EU and sell to consumers in
other EU countries to apply local VAT rates.

::: seealso
`EU intra-community distance selling<taxes/eu_distance_selling>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

#### Cash basis

Activate this option if taxes must be accounted for on a cash rather
than accruals basis. Some countries mandate cash basis accounting; in
that case, this option will be activated by default by the
`fiscal localization package <../fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

::: seealso
`Cash basis <taxes/cash_basis>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

### Activate pre-configured taxes {#taxes/list_activation}

The list of taxes can be accessed by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Generally, inactive taxes are created for most sales tax rates by the
`fiscal localization
<../fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} package, but
only the main tax rate is active by default. To activate an inactive
tax, click the toggle in the `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column.

### Assign taxes on products {#taxes/product}

To configure the taxes used for each product, go to
`Accounting --> Customers -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select the product to
configure, and fill the `Sales Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Purchase Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields. These
taxes are automatically applied when adding the product to an invoice,
vendor bill, sales order, purchase order, or point of sale order.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Use the `Default Taxes <taxes/default>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
company-wide setting to automatically fill these fields on new products.
::::

## Advanced tax configuration {#taxes/configuration/advanced}

The following aspects of a tax can be customized:

- How the tax
  `appears in the backend <taxes/configuration/back-end>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- How the tax
  `appears to customers <taxes/configuration/customer>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- The details of the
  `tax computation <taxes/tax_computation>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}
- How tax payable journal items are
  `created <taxes/definition-tab>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
- How to configure the tax to
  `replace <taxes/tax-mapping>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} other
  taxes according to
  `fiscal positions <taxes/fiscal_positions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.

To open a tax\'s configuration, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then click the tax name.

### Configure backend appearance and availability {#taxes/configuration/back-end}

The following options determine how a tax is displayed to users in the
Odoo back-end.

#### Tax name {#taxes/name}

The `Tax Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears for backend
users in the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field in `sales
orders <../../sales/sales>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"},
`invoices <customer_invoices>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, product
forms, etc.

#### Tax type {#taxes/scope}

The `Tax Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} determines where the
tax is available to be selected.

- **Sales**: Customer invoices, product customer taxes, etc.
- **Purchase**: Vendor bills, product vendor taxes, etc.
- **None**

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Use `None`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for taxes that you want to
include in a `Group of Taxes
<taxes/computation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} but that you do not
want to list along with other sales or purchase taxes.
::::

#### Tax scope

The `Tax Scope`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} restricts the use of
taxes to a type of product, either **goods** or **services**.

#### Description

The `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be edited for
the purpose of internal documentation.

### Configure how the tax appears to customers {#taxes/configuration/customer}

#### Label on invoices {#taxes/label-invoices}

The `Label on Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears on
invoice lines in invoice PDFs and on the customer portal.

![The Label on Invoice shows on the invoice line when viewed in the customer portal.](taxes/invoice-portal-tax.png)

#### Tax group {#taxes/tax-group}

The `Tax Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is shown in the
totals section of the invoice, in invoice PDFs and on the customer
portal. Multiple taxes that belong to the same tax group are aggregated
together into a single tax amount.

![The Tax Group shows in the totals section when viewed in the customer portal.](taxes/invoice-portal-total.png)

### Configure how tax journal items are created {#taxes/definition-tab}

The `Distribution for Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Distribution for Refunds`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sections
control the generation of tax payable journal items in invoices and
credit notes, respectively. They also determine which
`tax grids <accounting/tax-returns/tax-grids>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are set on invoice lines when this tax is applied.

Each of these sections should contain one `Base`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} line, one or more `% of tax`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} lines amounting to 100% (e.g. one 100% line, or two 50%
lines), and optionally, one or more `% of tax`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} lines amounting to -100.00%.

The `Base`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line can have one or more
`Tax Grids`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set, which are added to
the invoice line on which the tax is applied.

The `% of tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} lines control the
creation of tax payable journal items. The tax amount is distributed
according to the percentages on these lines, and each line is then used
as a template to create a tax payable journal item with the same
`Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Tax Grids`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If the
`Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is not specified, it
defaults to the account of the original invoice line on which the tax is
applied.

Typical cases include:

- one `100% of tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line: this is the
  most common case where the tax amount should appear on a single tax
  payable journal item.
- one `100% of tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and one
  `-100% of tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line: this is
  appropriate if the tax simultaneously generates both a tax debit and a
  tax credit which cancel each other out (e.g. EU intra-community
  reverse-charge VAT).
- one `50% of tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line that
  specifies a tax payable account and another
  `50% of tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line that does not
  specify an account: this is appropriate for partially deductible
  purchase VAT, where part of the tax must be considered an expense
  rather than a tax credit asset that can offset tax liability.

![The Distribution for Invoices of a 21% VAT tax.](taxes/distribution-invoices.png)

![The Distribution for Refunds of a 21% VAT tax.](taxes/distribution-refunds.png)

### Tax mapping {#taxes/tax-mapping}

Taxes can be combined with
`fiscal positions <taxes/fiscal_positions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to map taxes to each other so that the correct tax is
applied based on the customer\'s or vendor\'s location and business
type.

When configuring a tax, leave the `Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field blank to make the tax immediately available
across all fiscal positions, or select specific fiscal positions where
this tax should be used to replace other taxes with it. If one or more
fiscal positions are selected, use the `Replaces`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field to select all of the taxes that this tax should
replace for the selected fiscal position(s).

To replace one tax with multiple other taxes, configure each of the
replacement taxes to replace the default product tax.

::: example
As a sales tax, the `0% Exports`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tax
applies to quotations, sales orders, and invoices that use the
`Foreign Trade`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fiscal position. On
those records, any time that the `15%`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tax would be used, the `0% Exports`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tax is used instead.

![The \*\*0% Exports\*\* tax record](taxes/tax-mapping-example.png)
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Since the first fiscal position in the sequence is considered the
company\'s default, the taxes set on products are expected to be used
with that fiscal position, so the `Replaces`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field is not displayed on it.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To more easily view which taxes are replaced, use the
`oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`adjust settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the taxes list
view and display the `Replaces`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

![The \*\*Replaces\*\* field shown in the list view](taxes/tax-mapping-list.png)
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Tax mapping only works with
`active <taxes/list_activation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} taxes.
::::

## Extra taxes

\"Extra taxes\" is a broad term referring to additional taxes beyond the
standard or basic taxes imposed by governments. These extra taxes can be
**luxury** taxes, **environmental** taxes, **import** or **export
duties** taxes, etc.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The method to compute these taxes varies across different countries. We
recommend consulting your country\'s regulations to understand how to
calculate them for your business.
::::

To compute an extra tax in Odoo,
`create a tax <taxes/configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
enter a tax name, select a
`Tax Computation <taxes/configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
set an `Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and in the
`Advanced Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, enable
`Affect Base of Subsequent Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Then, drag and drop the taxes in the
`order they should be computed <taxes/base-subsequent>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

::: example
\- In Belgium, the formula to compute an environmental tax is: [(product
price + environmental tax) x sales tax]{.title-ref}. Therefore, our
environmental tax has to come *before* the sales tax in the computation
sequence. - In our case, we created a 5% environmental tax (Ecotax) and
put it *before* the Belgian base tax of 21%.

# Non-current assets and fixed assets

**Non-current Assets**, also known as **long-term assets**, are
investments that are expected to be realized after one year. They are
capitalized rather than being expensed and appear on the company\'s
balance sheet. Depending on their nature, they may undergo
**depreciation**.

**Fixed Assets** are a type of Non-current Assets and include the
properties bought for their productive aspects, such as buildings,
vehicles, equipment, land, and software.

For example, let\'s say we buy a car for \$ 27,000. We plan to amortize
it over five years, and we will sell it for \$ 7,000 afterward. Using
the linear, or straight-line, depreciation method, \$ 4,000 are expensed
each year as **depreciation expenses**. After five years, the
**Accumulated Depreciation** amount reported on the balance sheet equals
\$ 20,000, leaving us with \$ 7,000 of **Not Depreciable Value**, or
Salvage value.

Odoo Accounting handles depreciation by creating all depreciation
entries automatically in *draft mode*. They are then posted
periodically.

Odoo supports the following **Depreciation Methods**:

- Straight Line
- Declining
- Declining Then Straight Line

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The server checks once a day if an entry must be posted. It might then
take up to 24 hours before you see a change from *draft* to *posted*.
::::

## Prerequisites

Such transactions must be posted on an **Assets Account** rather than on
the default expense account.

### Configure an Assets Account

To configure your account in the **Chart of Accounts**, go to
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click on *Create*, and fill out the form.

![Configuration of an Assets Account in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets01.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This account\'s type must be either *Fixed Assets* or *Non-current
Assets*.
::::

### Post an expense to the right account

#### Select the account on a draft bill

On a draft bill, select the right account for all the assets you are
buying.

![Selection of an Assets Account on a draft bill in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets02.png){.align-center}

#### Choose a different Expense Account for specific products {#product-assets-account}

Start editing the product, go to the *Accounting* tab, select the right
**Expense Account**, and save.

![Change of the Assets Account for a product in Odoo](assets/assets03.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

It is possible to
`automate the creation of assets entries <assets-automation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for these products.
::::

#### Change the account of a posted journal item {#journal-assets-account}

To do so, open your Purchases Journal by going to
`Accounting --> Accounting -->
Purchases`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select the journal
item you want to modify, click on the account, and select the right one.

![Modification of a posted journal item\'s account in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets04.png){.align-center}

## Assets entries

### Create a new entry {#create-assets-entry}

An **Asset entry** automatically generates all journal entries in *draft
mode*. They are then posted one by one at the right time.

To create a new entry, go to
`Accounting --> Accounting --> Assets`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click on *Create*, and fill out the form.

Click on **select related purchases** to link an existing journal item
to this new entry. Some fields are then automatically filled out, and
the journal item is now listed under the **Related Purchase** tab.

![Assets entry in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets05.png){.align-center}

Once done, you can click on *Compute Depreciation* (next to the
*Confirm* button) to generate all the values of the **Depreciation
Board**. This board shows you all the entries that Odoo will post to
depreciate your asset, and at which date.

![Depreciation Board in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets06.png){.align-center}

#### What does \"Prorata Temporis\" mean?

The **Prorata Temporis** feature is useful to depreciate your assets the
most accurately possible.

With this feature, the first entry on the Depreciation Board is computed
based on the time left between the *Prorata Date* and the *First
Depreciation Date* rather than the default amount of time between
depreciations.

For example, the Depreciation Board above has its first depreciation
with an amount of \$ 241.10 rather than \$ 4,000.00. Consequently, the
last entry is also lower and has an amount of \$ 3758.90.

#### What are the different Depreciation Methods

The **Straight Line Depreciation Method** divides the initial
Depreciable Value by the number of depreciations planned. All
depreciation entries have the same amount.

The **Declining Depreciation Method** multiplies the Depreciable Value
by the **Declining Factor** for each entry. Each depreciation entry has
a lower amount than the previous entry. The last depreciation entry
doesn\'t use the declining factor but instead has an amount
corresponding to the balance of the depreciable value so that it reaches
\$0 by the end of the specified duration.

The **Declining Then Straight Line Depreciation Method** uses the
Declining Method, but with a minimum Depreciation equal to the Straight
Line Method. This method ensures a fast depreciation at the beginning,
followed by a constant one afterward.

### Assets from the Purchases Journal

You can create an asset entry from a specific journal item in your
**Purchases Journal**.

To do so, open your Purchases Journal by going to
`Accounting --> Accounting -->
Purchases`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select the
journal item you want to record as an asset. Make sure that it is posted
in the right account (see: `journal-assets-account`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}).

Then, click on *Action*, select **Create Asset**, and fill out the form
the same way you would do to
`create a new entry <create-assets-entry>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

![Create Asset Entry from a journal item in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets07.png){.align-center}

## Modification of an Asset

You can modify the values of an asset to increase or decrease its value.

To do so, open the asset you want to modify, and click on *Modify
Depreciation*. Then, fill out the form with the new depreciation values
and click on *Modify*.

A **decrease in value** posts a new Journal Entry for the **Value
Decrease** and modifies all the future *unposted* Journal Entries listed
in the Depreciation Board.

An **increase in value** requires you to fill out additional fields
related to the account movements and creates a new Asset entry with the
**Value Increase**. The Gross Increase Asset Entry can be accessed with
a Smart Button.

![Gross Increase smart button in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets08.png){.align-center}

## Disposal of Fixed Assets

To **sell** an asset or **dispose** of it implies that it must be
removed from the Balance Sheet.

To do so, open the asset you want to dispose of, click on *Sell or
Dispose*, and fill out the form.

![Disposal of Assets in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets09.png){.align-center}

Odoo Accounting then generates all the journal entries necessary to
dispose of the asset, including the gain or loss on sale, which is based
on the difference between the asset\'s book value at the time of the
sale and the amount it is sold for.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To record the sale of an asset, you must first post the related Customer
Invoice so you can link the sale of the asset with it.
::::

## Assets Models {#assets/asset-model}

You can create **Assets Models** to create your Asset entries faster. It
is particularly useful if you recurrently buy the same kind of assets.

To create a model, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Assets Models`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click on *Create*, and fill out the form the same
way you would do to create a new entry.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can also convert a *confirmed Asset entry* into a model by opening
it from `Accounting --> Accounting --> Assets`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and then, by clicking on the button *Save Model*.
::::

### Apply an Asset Model to a new entry

When you create a new Asset entry, fill out the **Fixed Asset Account**
with the right asset account.

New buttons with all the models linked to that account appear at the top
of the form. Clicking on a model button fills out the form according to
that model.

![Assets model button in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets10.png){.align-center}

## Automate the Assets {#assets-automation}

When you create or edit an account of which the type is either
*Non-current Assets* or *Fixed Assets*, you can configure it to create
assets for the expenses that are credited on it automatically.

You have three choices for the **Automate Assets** field:

1.  **No:** this is the default value. Nothing happens.
2.  **Create in draft:** whenever a transaction is posted on the
    account, a draft *Assets entry* is created, but not validated. You
    must first fill out the form in `Accounting -->
    Accounting --> Assets`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
3.  **Create and validate:** you must also select an Asset Model (see:
    [Assets Models](#assets-models)). Whenever a transaction is posted
    on the account, an *Assets entry* is created and immediately
    validated.

![Automate Assets on an account in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets11.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title

You can, for example, select this account as the default **Expense
Account** of a product to fully automate its purchase. (see:
`product-assets-account`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).

# Deferred expenses

**Deferred expenses** and **prepayments** (also known as **prepaid
expenses**) are both costs that have already occurred for products or
services yet to be received.

Such costs are **assets** for the company that pays them since it
already paid for products and services but has either not yet received
them or not yet used them. The company cannot report them on the current
**profit and loss statement**, or *income statement*, since the payments
will be effectively expensed in the future.

These future expenses must be deferred on the company\'s balance sheet
until the moment in time they can be **recognized**, at once or over a
defined period, on the profit and loss statement.

For example, let\'s say we pay \$1200 at once for one year of insurance.
We already pay the cost now but haven\'t used the service yet.
Therefore, we post this new expense in a *prepayment account* and decide
to recognize it on a monthly basis. Each month, for the next 12 months,
\$100 will be recognized as an expense.

Odoo Accounting handles deferred expenses by spreading them across
multiple entries that are posted periodically.

:::: note
::: title

The server checks once a day if an entry must be posted. It might then

::::

## Configuration

Make sure the default settings are correctly configured for your
business. To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. The following options are available:

Journal

:   The deferral entries are posted in this journal.

Deferred Expense

:   Expenses are deferred on this Current Asset account until they are
    recognized.

Generate Entries

:   By default, Odoo
    `automatically generates <vendor_bills/deferred/generate_on_validation>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} the deferral entries when you post a vendor bill.
    However, you can also choose to
    `generate them manually <vendor_bills/deferred/generate_manually>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} by selecting the `Manually & Grouped`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} option instead.

Based on

:   There are three ways to calculate the deferred expenses recognition:

    > - `Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The total amount is
    >   divided equally by the total number of days in the period,
    >   inclusive of the start and end dates.
    > - `Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Each full month
    >   represents an equal proportion of the total amount, regardless
    >   of the actual number of days in that month (standardized basis).
    > - `Full Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Any month
    >   started is treated as a complete month. However, the final month
    >   is only considered full if the period extends to the very last
    >   day of that month.

    Suppose a bill of \$1200 must be deferred over 12 months.

    - The `Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option accounts for
      different amounts depending on the number of days in each month
      (e.g., \~\$102 for January and \~\$92 for February).
    - The `Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option accounts
      for \$100 each month prorated to the number of days in that month
      (e.g., \$50 for the first month if the
      `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to the 15th
      of the month).
    - The `Full Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option
      considers each month started to be full (e.g., \$100 for the first
      month even if the `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
      is set to the 15th of the month); this means that with the
      `Full Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, a full
      \$100 is recognized in the first partial month, eliminating the
      need for a 13th month to recognize any remainder as would be the
      case when using the `Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
      option.

## Generate deferral entries on validation {#vendor_bills/deferred/generate_on_validation}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Make sure the `Deferred Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
is visible in the `Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab. In most cases, the start of the deferred period should be in the
same month as the `Accounting Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Deferred expense entries are posted from the accounting date and are
displayed in the report accordingly.
::::

For each line of the bill that should be deferred, specify the start and
end dates of the deferral period.

If the `Generate Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
set to `On invoice/bill validation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
Odoo automatically generates the deferral entries when the bill is
validated. Click on the `Deferred Entries`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button to see them.

One entry, dated on the same day as the bill\'s accounting date, moves
the bill amounts from the expense account to the deferred account. The
other entries are deferral entries which will, month after month, move
the bill amounts from the deferred account to the expense account to
recognize the expense.

::: example
You can defer a January bill of \$1200 over 12 months by specifying a
start date of 01/01/2023 and an end date of 12/31/2023. At the end of
August, \$800 is recognized as an expense, whereas \$400 remains on the
deferred account.
:::

## Reporting

The deferred expense report computes an overview of the necessary
deferral entries for each account. To access it, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Deferred Expense`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

To view the journal items of each account, click on the account name and
then `Journal
Items`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Deferred expense report](deferred_expenses/deferred_expense_report.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Only bills whose accounting date is before the end of the period of the
report are taken into account.
::::

## Generate grouped deferral entries manually {#vendor_bills/deferred/generate_manually}

If you have a lot of deferred revenues and wish to reduce the number of
journal entries created, you can generate deferral entries manually. To
do so, set the `Generate Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field in the **Settings** to `Manually & Grouped`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Odoo then aggregates the deferred amounts in a single
entry.

At the end of each month, go to the Deferred Expenses report and click
the `Generate Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. This
generates two deferral entries:

- One dated at the end of the month which aggregates, for each account,
  all the deferred amounts of that month. This means that at the end of
  that period, a part of the deferred expense is recognized.
- The reversal of this created entry, dated on the following day (i.e.,
  the first day of the next month) to cancel the previous entry.

::: example
There are three bills deferred based on `Months`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}:

- Bill A: \$1200 to be deferred from 01/01/2023 to 12/31/2023
- Bill B: \$600 to be deferred from 01/01/2023 to 12/31/2023
- Bill C: \$600 to be deferred in a future period (it will appear on the
  `Not Started`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column)

In January

:   At the end of January, after clicking the
    `Generate Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, there
    are the following entries:

    - Entry 1 dated on the 31st January:
      - Line 1: Expense account -1200 -600 -600 = **-2400** (cancelling
        the total of all bills)
      - Line 2: Expense account 100 + 50 = **150** (recognizing 1/12 of
        bill A and bill B)
      - Line 3: Deferred account 2400 - 150 = **2250** (amount that has
        yet to be deferred later on)
    - Entry 2 dated on the 1st February, the reversal of the previous
      entry:
      - Line 1: Expense account **2400**
      - Line 3: Expense account **-150**
      - Line 2: Deferred account **-2250**

In February

:   At the end of February, after clicking the
    `Generate Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, there
    are the following entries:

    - Entry 1 dated on the 28th February:
      - Line 1: Expense account -1200 -600 -600 = **-2400** (cancelling
        the total of all bills)
      - Line 2: Expense account 200 + 100 = **300** (recognizing 2/12 of
        bill A and bill B)
      - Line 3: Deferred account 2400 - 300 = **2100** (amount that has
        yet to be deferred later on)
    - Entry 2 dated on the 1st March, the reversal of the previous
      entry.

From March to November

:   The same computation is done for each month until November.

In December

:   There is no need to generate entries in December.

In total

:   If we aggregate everything, we would have:

    - Bill A and Bill B
    - Two entries (one for the deferral and one for the reversal) for
      each month from January to November
    - Bill C will be deferred later

    Therefore, at the end of December, bills A and B are fully
    recognized as expense only once in spite of all the created entries
    thanks to the reversal mechanism.

# Document digitization

Document digitization refers to the process of converting paper or
digital documents into records in a database. Using
`OCR (optical character recognition)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
artificial intelligence technologies, Odoo reads the content and
automatically creates and fills in the record\'s details. This process
is mainly used for vendor bills (or refunds).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Although less common, this digitization process can also be applied to
customer invoices and credit notes. The
`settings <accounting/bill-digitization/configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} need to be adjusted accordingly.

:::

## Configuration {#accounting/bill-digitization/configuration}

Go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and navigate to the
`Digitization`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Enable the
`Document Digitization`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option and
choose whether `Vendor Bills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should
be processed automatically or on demand.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the `Single Invoice Line Per Tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option is enabled, only one line is created per tax in the new vendor
bill, regardless of the number of lines on it.
::::

## Vendor bills upload {#accounting/bill-digitization/vendor-bills-upload}

Vendor bills are
`uploaded manually <accounting/bill-digitization/manual-upload>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or sent to a
`designated email alias <accounting/bill-digitization/email-alias>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to be digitized. They can also be
`automatically posted <accounting/bill-digitization/auto-post-bills>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for selected vendors.

:::: note

Once the bill is uploaded, the document preview appears on the right
side of the screen.

::: seealso
`Vendor bills <../vendor_bills>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

### Manual upload {#accounting/bill-digitization/manual-upload}

In the Accounting dashboard, drag and drop vendor bills into the desired
purchase journal or click `Upload`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on
the purchase journal.

### Upload via email alias {#accounting/bill-digitization/email-alias}

Vendor bills can be uploaded via an email alias associated with the
relevant journal in two ways:

- scanned from a connected scanner configured to send email to an email
  alias;
- sent directly to an email alias.

Each PDF attached to the email is automatically converted into a new
draft vendor bill.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Only PDF and XML formats are processed via an email alias associated
with a journal. - JPEG files must be processed via
`email alias in the Documents app
<documents/email-aliases>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

To add an email alias to a journal, follow these steps:

1.  Make sure an
    `alias domain <../../../websites/website/configuration/domain_names>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} has been configured.
2.  The default email alias [vendor-bills@]{.title-ref} followed by the
    alias domain is automatically created and available in the
    `Advanced Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
    `Vendor Bills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} journal.
3.  To change a default email alias, go to
    `Accounting --> Configuration -->
    Journals`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select the
    corresponding journal, and edit the `Email Alias`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} in the `Advanced Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} tab.
4.  Configure the connected scanner to send scanned documents to the
    email alias, if needed.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Alternatively, an
`email alias in the Documents app <documents/email-aliases>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} can be used to automatically send vendor bills to the
`Finance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} `folder
<documents/folders>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} (e.g.,
[inbox-financial@example.odoo.com]{.title-ref}).
::::

### Automatic vendor bill posting {#accounting/bill-digitization/auto-post-bills}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To use the `Auto-post bills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option,
the `Digitize automatically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting
in the
`Document Digitization <accounting/bill-digitization/configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} section must be enabled for vendor bills.
::::

To automatically post digitized vendor bills for specific vendors, go to
`Accounting
--> Vendors --> Vendors`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
click the desired vendor. In the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of the contact form, select an
`Auto-post bills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option in the
`Automation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section:

- `Always`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Ask after 3 validations without edits`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: When the third uploaded bill is confirmed without
  any edits, an `Autopost Bills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  window appears. The following options can be chosen:
  `Activate auto-validation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Ask me later`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or `Never for
  this vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Never`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Since automation is triggered after three validated bills without edits,
the contact name must already exist in the database, and each uploaded
vendor bill must include a bill date.
::::

## Digitization and data recognition with AI {#accounting/bill-digitization/digitization}

Depending on the
`settings <accounting/bill-digitization/configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, documents are either automatically digitized or require
manual processing if digitization is set to on-demand only.

To manually digitize an `uploaded document
<accounting/bill-digitization/vendor-bills-upload>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, click `Digitize document`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Once the document has been digitized, a blue banner appears; click
`oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Refresh`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Review and correct any
information uploaded during digitization: click on the related field(s)
to edit them, or click `Reload AI data`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to refresh the data.

Then, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to post the
document.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Once a document has been digitized, the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field remains empty if the vendor doesn\'t exist in the
database. To add it, click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field; the vendor name
appears highlighted in the document preview on the right. Click it to
open a new vendor form with the name pre-filled.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The following vendor bill fields are recognized by OCR:

- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Bill Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Bill Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Payment
  Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (only in the Belgian
  +++xxx/xxxx/xxxxx+++ format), `Recipient Bank`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Due Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  the currency (in a `multi-currency
  <../get_started/multi_currency>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
  environment and if the currency is activated).
- From the `Invoices Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:
  `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} description/label,
  `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, unit
  `Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Taxes`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} (if the `tax is activated
  <taxes/list_activation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}; this field is
  not recognized by OCR for the `Indian
  localization <../../fiscal_localizations/india>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}), `Untaxed Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

## Purchase order matching {#accounting/bill-digitization/vendor-bills-matching-po}

When a digitized vendor bill is recognized by
`OCR (optical character recognition)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
Odoo searches the database for a matching purchase order. If found, the
vendor bill can be manually matched with the existing open purchase
order lines.

Once a vendor bill has been
`uploaded <accounting/bill-digitization/vendor-bills-upload>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and
`digitized <accounting/bill-digitization/digitization>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, click the `Purchase
matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button to access the
`Purchase matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list view,
displaying all purchase order lines linked to the vendor assigned to the
vendor bill. Then, select the relevant purchase order lines and the
draft vendor bill (shown in grey), and click `Match`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

In the `Purchase Matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list view,
update the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the purchase order lines,
if necessary.
::::

If there is no existing purchase order related to the vendor of the
uploaded vendor bill, a new purchase order can be directly created from
the vendor bill lines. To do so, follow these steps:

1.  Once the vendor bill is uploaded, make sure the
    `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is filled in with
    the correct vendor.
2.  Click the `Purchase matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    smart button, select the draft vendor bill in the list (shown in
    grey), and click `Add to PO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
3.  In the `Add to Purchase Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    window, start typing in the `Purchase Order`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field and select
    `Create and edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
4.  In the `Create Purchase Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    window, select the vendor assigned to the vendor bill, then complete
    all
    `required fields <purchase/manage_deals/create-new-rfq>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
5.  In the `Purchase Matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list
    view, select the relevant purchase order lines and the draft vendor
    bill (shown in grey), and click `Match`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If any information required for the purchase order fields is missing,
click `Save and
Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Create Purchase Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window. Then,
open the Purchase app to fill in the fields and
`confirm the purchase order <purchase/manage_deals/confirm-order>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- Electronic vendor bills with embedded XML ensure more accurate and
efficient processing. - Alternatively, the
`Auto-complete <accounting/vendor_bills/bill-completion>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} feature can transfer information from the purchase order to
the vendor bill, without requiring OCR.
::::

## Pricing {#accounting/bill-digitization/pricing}

The document digitization feature is an In-App Purchase (IAP) service
requiring prepaid credits. Digitizing one document uses one credit.

To buy credits,
`go to the Settings app <iap/buying_credits>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
navigate to the `Digitization`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section, and click `Buy credits`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Odoo Enterprise users with a valid subscription get free credits to
test IAP features before purchasing more credits for the database. This
includes demo/training databases, educational databases, and
one-app-free databases. - XML files don\'t require OCR credits because
they contain structured data that can be processed directly, without
OCR.

# Vendor bill sequence

When confirming a vendor bill, Odoo generates a unique vendor bill
reference number. By default, it uses the sequence format
[BILL/year/month/incrementing-number]{.title-ref} (e.g.,
[BILL/2025/01/00001]{.title-ref}), which restarts from
[00001]{.title-ref} each year.

However, it is possible to
`change the sequence format <accounting/vendor_bills/resequencing>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and its periodicity, and to `mass-resequence vendor bills
<accounting/vendor_bills/mass-resequencing>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Changes made to reference numbers are logged in the chatter.
::::

## Changing the default sequence {#accounting/vendor_bills/resequencing}

To customize the default sequence, open the last confirmed vendor bill,
click `Reset to
Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and edit the vendor bill\'s
reference number.

![Editing the reference number of a vendor bill.](sequence/sequence-reference-number.png)

Odoo then explains how the detected format will be applied to all future
vendor bills. For example, if the current vendor bill\'s month is
withdrawn, the sequence\'s periodicity will change to every year instead
of every month.

![Editing the reference number of a vendor bill.](sequence/sequence-dialog.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The sequence format can be edited directly when creating the first
vendor bill of a given sequence period.
::::

## Mass-resequencing vendor bills {#accounting/vendor_bills/mass-resequencing}

It can be helpful to resequence multiple vendor bill numbers. For
example, when importing vendor bills from another accounting system and
the reference originates from the previous software, continuity for the
current year must be maintained without restarting from the beginning.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This feature is only available to users with administrator or advisor
access.
::::

Follow these steps to resequence vendor bill numbers:

1.  Activate the `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
2.  In the vendor bills list view, select the vendor bills that need a
    new sequence.
3.  Click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    `Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu and select
    `Resequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
4.  In the `Ordering`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, choose
    to
    - `Keep current order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The order
      of the numbers remains the same.
    - `Reorder by accounting date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
      The number is reordered by accounting date.
5.  Set the `First New Sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
6.  `Preview Modifications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and click
    `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Resequence options window](sequence/sequence-bill-sequencing.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- To indicate where the sequence change began, the first vendor bill in
the new sequence is highlighted in red in the
`Vendor Bills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list. This visual
marker is permanent and purely informational. - If there are any
irregularities in the new sequence, such as gaps, cancelled, or deleted
entries within the open period, a
`Gaps in the sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} message
appears in the `Vendor Bills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} journal
on the Accounting dashboard. To view more details about the related
vendor bill(s), click `Gaps in the sequence`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. This visual marker is temporary and will disappear
once the entry\'s accounting date is on or after the lock date.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Resequencing is not possible:

- When entries are before a lock date.
- When the sequence leads to a duplicate.
- When the range is invalid. For example, if the
  `Bill Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} doesn\'t align with the
  date in the new sequence, such as using a 2024 sequence
  (BILL/2024/MM/XXXX) for an vendor bill dated in 2025.

In these cases, a `Validation Error`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
message appears.

### Automatically {#accounting/vendor_bills/automatic}

Vendor bills can be automatically created by sending an email to an
`email alias
<accounting/bill-digitization/email-alias>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} associated with the purchase journal, or by
`uploading a PDF <accounting/bill-digitization/manual-upload>`{.interpreted-text

:::

\- Once the bill is uploaded, the PDF document appears on the right side
of the screen, making it easy to fill in the bill information. - Bills
can be `digitized <vendor_bills/invoice_digitization>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for automatic completion and `matched with purchase orders
<accounting/bill-digitization/vendor-bills-matching-po>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to replace OCR-detected data with the existing purchase
order\'s details. - Services such as digitizing scanned or PDF vendor
bills in Odoo require `In-App
Purchase (IAP) </applications/essentials/in_app_purchase>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} credits.
::::

To automatically post bills from selected vendors, go to
`Accounting --> Vendors -->
Vendors`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select the relevant
vendor. In the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
under the `General`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, update
the `Auto-post bills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field with one

## Bill completion {#accounting/vendor_bills/bill-completion}

Whether the bill is created manually or automatically, make sure the
following fields are appropriately completed:

- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Odoo automatically fills
  in some information based on the information on the vendor\'s contact
  record as well as previous purchase orders and bills.
- `Bill Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Add the sales
  order reference provided by the vendor. This field is used to
  `match <accounting/payments/payments-matching>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} the products when they are received.
- `Auto-Complete`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select a past
  bill/purchase order to complete the document automatically. The
  `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field should be completed
  before completing this field.
- `Bill Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the document\'s
  issuance date.
- `Accounting Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Update the
  document\'s accounting registration date if needed.
- `Payment Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The
  `Memo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field automatically includes
  the payment reference once the payment is registered.
- `Recipient Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Indicates the
  account number to which the payment will be made. This field is
  required when paying via batch payment files (such as `NACHA
  <l10n_us/ach-electronic-transfers>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
  `SEPA <payments/pay_sepa>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}).
- `Due Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be specified
  for the bill payment.
- `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select which journal
  should record the bill and in which `currency
  <get_started/multi_currency>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

In the `Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:

- To access the product catalog, click `Catalog
  </applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory/warehouses_storage/inventory_management/product_catalog>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.
- Select the products and quantities, then click
  `Back to Bill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to return to the
  vendor bill; the selected catalog items will appear in the vendor bill
  lines.
- Update the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Taxes <taxes>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} fields if needed.

Note
:::

Multiple bills for the same purchase order may be issued if the vendor
is on back-order and sends invoices as products are shipped or if the
vendor sends partial bills or requests a deposit. In this case, multiple
bills may have the same `Bill Reference`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

## Bill confirmation {#accounting/vendor_bills/bill-confirmation}

Click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} when the document is
completed. The status changes to `Posted`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and a journal entry is generated based on the vendor
bill information. On confirmation, Odoo assigns each vendor bill a
unique number from a defined
`sequence <vendor_bills/sequence>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

:::: note

Once confirmed, a vendor bill can no longer be updated. Click
`Reset to draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if changes are
required.
::::

## Payment and reconciliation {#accounting/vendor_bills/bill-payment}

To register a payment, click on `Pay`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. In the `Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
window, select the `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

When the `Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} paid is less than
the total remaining amount on the vendor bill, the payment is
`partial <accounting/payments/partial-payment>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and the `Payment
Difference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field displays the
outstanding balance.

The `Memo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is filled
automatically if the `Payment Reference`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} has been set correctly on the vendor bill. If the field
is empty, select the vendor invoice number as a reference.

Then click `Create payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. An
`In Payment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}/`Partial`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner
appears on the bill until it is
`reconciled <bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and its
status updates to `Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Accounting and Invoicing

Odoo Invoicing is a standalone app designed to create invoices, send
them to customers, and manage payments. It also handles flows involving
vendor bills. On the other hand, the Accounting app is a comprehensive
accounting solution that allows the same actions and includes additional
features such as standard financial reports, bank reconciliation,
budgets, asset management, and more.

## Double-entry bookkeeping {#accounting/double-entry-booking}

Odoo automatically creates all the underlying journal entries for all
accounting transactions (e.g., customer invoices, vendor bills,
point-of-sales orders, expenses, inventory valuations, etc.).

Odoo uses the double-entry bookkeeping system, whereby every entry needs
a corresponding and opposite counterpart in a different account, with
one account debited and the other credited. It ensures that all
transactions are recorded accurately and consistently and that the
accounts always balance.

::: seealso
`Accounting Cheat Sheet <accounting/get_started/cheat_sheet>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Accrual and cash basis {#accounting/accrual-cash}

Both accrual and cash basis accounting are supported in Odoo. This
allows reporting income and expense either when the transaction occurs
(accrual basis) or when the payment is made or received (cash basis).

::: seealso
`Cash basis <accounting/taxes/cash_basis>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Multi-company {#accounting/multi-company}

`Multiple companies <../general/companies/multi_company>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} can be managed within the same database. Each company has
its own `chart of accounts
<accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, but `accounts can be shared
<consolidation_account_mapping>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, which is
useful when viewing consolidation reports. Users can view records and
reports from multiple companies simultaneously but can only work on a
single company\'s accounting at a time.

## Multi-currency environment {#accounting/multi-currency}

A
`multi-currency <accounting/get_started/multi_currency>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} environment with an automated exchange rate to ease
international transactions is available in Odoo. Every transaction is
recorded in the company\'s default currency; for transactions occurring
in another currency, Odoo stores both the value in the company\'s
currency and the transactions\' currency value. Odoo generates currency
gains and losses after reconciling the journal items.

## Branches {#accounting/branches}

Parent `companies </applications/general/companies>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and their `branches
<general/companies/branches>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} can be
managed within a single database, operating under shared accounting and
reporting rules, including the following:

- The parent company's
  `chart of accounts <accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"},
  `main currency <accounting/get_started/multi_currency>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, and `taxes <accounting/taxes>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} apply to all branches.
- Branches can manage their own dedicated journals and related records.
- The parent company manages a common
  `fiscal period <accounting/year-end/fiscal-years>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, so its
  `lock and closing dates <accounting/year-end/lock-everything-date>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} apply across all branches. However, branches may set
  earlier lock dates if needed.
- The parent company can access all
  `reports <accounting/reporting>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"},
  `invoices
  <accounting/customer_invoices>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"},
  `bills <accounting/vendor_bills>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, etc.,
  from its branches, while each branch can only view its own data.

### Reporting {#accounting/branch/reporting}

The parent company consolidates accounting operations from all branches,
providing a centralized view of
`financial reports <accounting/reporting>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, such as profit and loss or balance sheets.

### VAT {#accounting/branch/vat}

Each company and branch must be configured with its own legal
information, including a VAT number when applicable. Depending on the
structure, branches may share the parent company\'s VAT number or have
their own, resulting in a common or separate `VAT return
<accounting/reporting/tax_returns>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

This flexible setup allows users to generate individual reports and tax
returns for each entity if needed.

## International standards {#accounting/international-standards}

Odoo Accounting supports over 100 countries and provides standardized
features and mechanisms applicable across all regions. Country-specific
modules are included to comply with local accounting regulations.
`Fiscal localizations <fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} handle regional requirements, such as charts of accounts,
taxes, or any other legal obligations.

## Accounts receivable and payable {#accounting/accounts-receivable-payable}

By default, one account is designated for accounts receivable entries
and another for accounts payable entries. As transactions are linked to
**contacts**, it is possible to run a report per customer, vendor, or
supplier.

The **Partner Ledger** report displays the balance of customers and
suppliers. To access it, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Partner Ledger`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

## Reporting {#accounting/reporting}

The following financial
`reports <accounting/reporting>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} are
available and updated in real-time:

# ESG

The ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance) app helps you automate ESG
data collection by integrating with apps like Accounting, Fleet,
Payroll, and Employees. It pulls data from your operations to build your
ESG reports, based on legal and sustainability reporting requirements,
while giving you a real-time view of your emissions and other key ESG
metrics.

## Carbon footprint

The carbon footprint tool automates emissions tracking by collecting
data from accounting records (purchases, expenses, etc.) and employee
commuting activity, and supports manual inputs. Emissions are updated in
real time, allowing for continuous monitoring and reporting. You can:

- Track your daily environmental impact.
- Evaluate the immediate effect of your reduction actions.
- Prioritize targeted changes.
- Continuously monitor and refine your sustainability strategy.

::: admonition
Emissions (kgCO₂e) formula

[Activity data]{.title-ref} × [Emission factor]{.title-ref}
:::

### Activity data sources

The following data sources are used:

- `Accounting <esg/accounting>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
- `Fleet <esg/fleet>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
- `Manual inputs <esg/manual>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

#### Accounting {#esg/accounting}

Odoo collects activity data from journal entries posted to expense and
asset accounts. These include:

- Fixed assets
- Expenses
- Other expenses
- Cost of revenue

Only these account types are considered for carbon footprint
calculations, in line with the *Bilan Carbone* methodology.

#### Fleet {#esg/fleet}

Odoo calculates commuting emissions using data from the Fleet and
Employees apps.

::: admonition
Employee commuting emissions formula

[Days]{.title-ref} × [Home-work distance]{.title-ref} × [2]{.title-ref}
× ([Number of office days]{.title-ref} / [7]{.title-ref}) × [Vehicle
model CO₂ emissions]{.title-ref}
:::

To ensure accurate calculations:

- Define the average number of days per week the employees commute to
  the office by going to
  `ESG --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"} and filling in the `Weekly Office
  Attendance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- Set the emissions of each vehicle model by going to
  `Fleet --> Configuration -->
  Models`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, selecting a model,
  and entering its `CO₂ Emissions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- Set each employee\'s home-to-work distance by opening the
  `Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app, selecting an
  employee, and filling in the employee\'s
  `Home-Work Distance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The employee vehicle\'s `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and, if applicable, `End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, are
used to calculate the emissions. Ensure they are set by opening the
`Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app, selecting an
employee, and clicking the `Cars`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
smart button.
::::

To access the employee commuting emissions pivot table, go to
`ESG --> Collect -->
Employee Commuting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

![The employee commuting emissions pivot table](esg/employee-commuting-pivot.png)

To add the data to the emitted emissions, click
`Add Emissions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, define the
`Emissions Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that should be
covered, and click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

#### Manual input {#esg/manual}

You can manually enter emissions for activities that not tracked
automatically (e.g., employee lunches, waste, etc.). To do so, go to
`ESG --> Collect --> Emitted Emissions`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, then:

- Name the activity.
- Select a `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- Select an `Emission factor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- Enter a `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Once saved, the entry appears under
`ESG --> Collect --> Emitted Emissions`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and is included in the carbon footprint report.

### Emission factors

An emission factor is a coefficient that indicates the rate at which a
specific activity emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

#### Source database

Import the data from a certified emission factors database by going to
`ESG -->
Configuration --> Source Databases`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click `Download`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the
[ADEME](https://www.ademe.fr/en/our-missions/data) database to import
its emission factors and sources.

#### Main components of an emission factor

##### Source

Each emission factor is assigned to a scope, following the GHG Protocol:

- Scope 1 -- Direct emissions (e.g., fuel burned on-site or in company
  vehicles)
- Scope 2 -- Indirect emissions from purchased energy (e.g., electricity
  or heat)
- Scope 3 -- All other indirect emissions across the value chain (e.g.,
  purchased goods, travel, waste)

Scopes can be structured hierarchically (parent-child) for more detailed
categorization, such as \"Scope 3: Others Indirect \> Purchased Goods \>
Electronics\".

##### Uncertainty

Uncertainty represents the potential margin of error in an emission
factor. It reflects how precise or reliable the factor is when
estimating emissions for a given activity, based on the quality of data,
assumptions used, and calculation methodology.

It helps you assess the confidence level of the emissions data used in
the reporting.

##### Compute method

The compute method determines whether emissions are calculated using
physical quantities (e.g., kg, liters, units) or monetary values (e.g.,
€ spent). In physical mode, the system uses the quantity from the
transaction (e.g., 10 units × `EF (emission factor)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} per unit). In monetary mode, it uses the transaction amount
(e.g., €500 × `EF (emission factor)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} per
€).

##### Gas emissions lines

Each emission factor can include multiple gas emission lines,
representing the different greenhouse gases involved in the activity.
The ESG app includes the six main gases from the Kyoto Protocol --- CO₂,
CH₄, N₂O, HFCs, PFCs, SF₆ --- each with a predefined Global Warming
Potential (GWP) used to convert them into a common unit: CO₂-equivalent
(kgCO₂e).

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Add more specific gases by going to
`ESG --> Configuration --> Gases`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

Each gas line can be linked to an activity type such as production,
transport, or use, allowing for detailed breakdowns in your emissions
reporting.

The final emission factor value is the sum of all these gases' emissions
converted into CO₂-equivalents.

#### Assignation rules

Assignation rules allow emission factors to be automatically applied to
relevant activity data based on specific criteria: the product, partner,
and/or account involved in the transaction.

::: example
You have assigned an emission factor to the *Zenith Pro Computer*
product and later receive a vendor bill for 150 units; the system
automatically applies the assigned emission factor, multiplying the
emission factor\'s emissions (kgCO₂e) by 150.
:::

To define assignation rules on emissions factors, go to
`ESG --> Configuration -->
Emission Factors`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select an
emission factor. Under the `Assignations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and select a record for one or more of the following
attributes: `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

All attributes have to match for the rule to be applied.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Ensure the unit of measure set next to the product\'s
`Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} matches the emission factor\'s
`Unit of Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![A product\'s unit of measure](esg/product-unit-of-measure.png)

If the field is not displayed, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and enable the
`Units of Measure & Packagings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option.

Tip
:::

Accounting journal entries with a missing emission factor can be found
by clicking `Emissions to define`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
under the `Collect Emissions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} card on
the dashboard.
::::

##### Rules priority

When multiple assignation rules match, Odoo prioritizes the most
specific rule based on the following criteria:

1.  Attribute specificity: Odoo first evaluates rules by the most
    precise attribute, following this priority hierarchy (from most to
    least specific):
    1.  Product
    2.  Partner
    3.  Account
2.  Attribute count: if multiple rules share the same level of attribute
    specificity, Odoo then considers the number of attributes in the
    rule. The rule with more attributes defined will take priority.

::: example
**Example 1**

*Emission factor #1 assignation rule*

  Account         Partner         Product
  --------------- --------------- -------------------------
  *Any Account*   *Any Partner*   **Zenith Pro Computer**

*Emission factor #2 assignation rule*

  Account         Partner           Product
  --------------- ----------------- ---------------
  *Any Account*   **Digital Den**   *Any Product*

Given the assignation rules above, all products purchased from **Digital
Den** will be assigned emission factor **#2**, except the **Zenith Pro
Computer** product, which will be assigned emission factor **#1**.

**Example 2**

*Emission factor #1 assignation rule*

  Account         Partner         Product
  --------------- --------------- -------------------------
  *Any Account*   *Any Partner*   **Zenith Pro Computer**

*Emission factor #2 assignation rule*

  Account         Partner           Product
  --------------- ----------------- -------------------------
  *Any Account*   **Digital Den**   **Zenith Pro Computer**

Given the assignation rules above, any purchased **Zenith Pro Computer**
will be assigned emission factor **#1**, except if purchased from the
**Digital Den**, which will be assigned emission factor **#2**.
:::

##### Apply retroactively

Once your emission factors are configured with assignation rules, you
can also apply them retroactively to past activity data.

To do so, go to
`ESG -->  Configuration --> Emission Factors`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select an emission factor, and click
`Assign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Select an
`Application Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and, if
desired, enable the `Replace existing assignations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option.

:::: tip

## Sex parity and pay gap

Sex parity tracks the distribution of sexes across the workforce, such
as comparing women and men in technical vs. administrative roles,
permanent vs. temporary contracts, different office locations, or
management vs. non-management positions.

These insights, based on employee data, are essential for CSRD reporting
under ESRS S1 and will also support future VSME standards.

To view a company\'s sex parity and pay gap measures, set the sex of
each employee by opening the `Employees`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} app and selecting an employee. Under the
`Private Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, select the
employee\'s `Gender`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The pay gap is calculated using the wages set on the employees\' Payroll
contracts for the same jobs.

::: admonition
Pay gap formula

(([Average male salary]{.title-ref} -- [Average female
salary]{.title-ref}) / [Average male salary]{.title-ref}) ×

# Approve expenses

In Odoo, most users cannot approve expenses; only users with the
necessary `access rights
<../../general/users/access_rights>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} or
permissions can. This means that a user **must** have at least *Team
Approver* rights for the **Expenses** app. Employees with the necessary
rights can review expenses, approve or refuse them, and provide feedback
with an integrated `Refuse Expense
<expenses/refuse-report>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} communication
tool.

Please refer to the
`access rights documentation </applications/general/users>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to learn more about managing users and their access rights.

## View expense reports

Users who are able to approve expense reports (typically managers) have
an `Expense
Reports`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} main navigation button at
the top of the **Expenses** app. This allows managers to view all
expense reports they have access rights for. Navigate to
`Expenses app --> Expense
Reports`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, to view the
`All Reports`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

A list of all expense reports with a status of either
`To Submit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Submitted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Posted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or `Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} appears. Expense reports with a status of
`Refused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are hidden, by default.

![Reports to validate are found on the Reports to Approve page.](approve_expenses/expense-reports-list.png)

## Approve expense reports

Expense reports can be approved in two ways:
`individually <expenses/individual>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or
`in
bulk <expenses/multiple>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

# Expense cards

Odoo offers physical and virtual expense cards, allowing for better
expense tracking and management. Using expense cards allows for real
time expense management, creating expense records as soon as an expense
transaction occurs, allowing management greater visibility of expense
costs as they are incurred.

The elimination of the need to
`actively create expense records <log_expenses>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} allows for a more streamlined expense workflow, with records
automatically created as purchases are made.

To use expense cards, first a
`card is configured <expenses/card-configure>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, then it is
`activated <expenses/card-activate>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
Before employees can make purchases with their expense card, a
`Stripe account must be created <expenses/create-stripe>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and configured, then
`funds must be added <expenses/add-funds>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
to the company\'s Stripe account. Once there is money available in the
account (this typically takes 2-3 business days for the transfer to
Stripe), employees can use their expense cards, and the money is pulled
from the company\'s Stripe account.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To create and use expense cards, both the **Accounting** and
**Invoicing** apps **must** be
`installed <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

To access confidential card data (card number and CVV for virtual cards;
PIN for physical cards), the employee **must** have a
`user <../../general/users>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} profile.
These details can **only** be accessed through that profile.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Expense cards act like pre-paid debit cards, as they can **only** be
used with a connected Stripe account, and **only** if funds are added to
that account, to be drawn from.
::::

## Availability

Expense cards are currently available for the following countries:

  ------------- ------------- ------------- -------------
  Austria       Belgium       Croatia       Cyprus

  Estonia       Finland       France        Germany

  Greece        Ireland       Italy         Latvia

  Lithuania     Luxembourg    Malta         Netherlands

  Portugal      Slovakia      Slovenia      Spain
  ------------- ------------- ------------- -------------

Only companies located in one of these countries are able to create and
use expense cards.

## Fees

Odoo covers **all fees** associated with creating virtual and physical
cards.

## Configuration {#expenses/card-settings}

Two settings must be configured to use expense cards. Navigate to
`Expenses app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Tick the box next to `Expense Card`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
then click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page reloads, and two
fields now appear beneath the `Expense Card`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option.

A `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field with
`Stripe Issuing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears, populating
the field. This is the default journal, and it is **not** recommended to
alter this unless instructed by the accounting department.

Next, click the text link `terms and conditions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and an `Expense Cards Terms and
Conditions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window loads, with
all the details of the agreement. After this has been read, click
`Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then tick the checkbox next
to `I confirm agreeing to the terms
and conditions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to accept the terms,
then click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The terms and conditions **must** be agreed to use expense cards.
::::

After agreeing to the terms and conditions,
`create a Stripe connected account
<expenses/create-stripe>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

## Create Stripe connected account {#expenses/create-stripe}

To create a Stripe connected account, open the **Expenses** app, and
ensure the `Expense
Card`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is enabled. Next, click
`oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Connect`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a new Stripe
Issuing connect account.

Fill in the KYC questionnaire provided by Stripe. Stripe takes +/-24
hours to approve or refuse account creation requests.

A green `Verified`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tag now appears
next to `oi-arrow-left`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Refresh`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, indicating the account is
properly configured.

Once the account is verified, the company must
`add funds <expenses/add-funds>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to their
Stripe balance.

## Add funds to Stripe account {#expenses/add-funds}

For employees to use their expense cards, funds must be available in the
company\'s Stripe account, to make purchases against. To add funds to
the company\'s Stripe account, open the **Accounting** app. On the
`Stripe Issuing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} Kanban card, click
`Top-up`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a
`Top-up`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window loads.

Enter the amount being transferred into the account in the
`Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. The
`IBAN`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `BIC`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} fields are populated according to the Stripe
configuration and cannot be changed. When configured, click
`Topup`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the transfer is
initiated.

:::: note

## Configure expense cards {#expenses/card-configure}

To create and configure a new expense card, click
`Cards`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} in the main **Expenses**
app menu to view the `Cards`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
dashboard. Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a blank
`Cards`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form loads. Enter the
following information on the form:

- `Card Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The first line on the
  card form is blank, and displays [Draft]{.title-ref}. Enter a name for
  the card in this field. This does **not** need to be a person\'s name,
  it can be something descriptive to explain the use of the card.

  ::: example
  An employee is going on a week-long business trip to Berlin to visit
  many clients. The employee needs to pay for meals, transportation, and
  other business-related expenses. Since this is a short trip, a virtual
  card is created to capture all the expenses, with the name [Business
  Trip - Berlin]{.title-ref}.

  The marketing department pays for many expenses throughout the year,
  from email marketing services, venue rentals for events, promotional
  merchandise, etc. Since the expenses do not have an end date, and it
  is used for an entire department, a physical card is ordered with the
  name [Marketing]{.title-ref}.
  :::

- `Cardholder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the person
  using the card from the drop-down menu. Once selected, the person\'s
  name populates the `Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
  above `Cardholder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Update info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Next to the
  cardholder\'s name, click `Update info`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} and a `Cardholder Configuration`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} pop-up window loads. Update the cardholder\'s name,
  birthday, phone number, email, and physical address. All the requested
  information **must** be populated, as it is used to create the expense
  card with Stripe, and to verify the cardholder\'s identity, when
  needed. If any information is missing from this form, the card
  **cannot** be created, and an error appears when creating or ordering
  the card.

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  The phone number listed is used for two-factor authentication. The
  phone number can be changed in the future. When changing the phone
  number, an alert is sent to the original phone number, notifying them
  of the change.
  ::::

- `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Click the radio button next
  to the desired *type* of expense card. Options are:

  - `Physical`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A physical card is
    printed and mailed out to the employee. If selected, a
    `Delivery Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears.
    Using the drop-down menu, select the employee or company address the
    card is mailed to.
  - `Virtual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Virtual cards are
    available instantaneously once the card configuration is completed
    and the card is activated.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the company the
  expenses are associated with using the drop-down menu. Each card must
  be associated with a single company, and are **not** available for use
  between all companies or branches in the database. Ensure the selected
  company has its own Stripe Connect account configured, or the expense
  cards will not work.

- `Stripe Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `Stripe Issuing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} populates this
  field by default, and cannot be modified.

Next, configure the following fields in the
`Spending Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the card
form:

- `Countries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the countries the card is able to be used in. The
  company\'s country location populates this field, by default. All
  other countries the employee may travel to or purchase expensable
  items from, should be included in this list.

- `Categories`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the expense card
  is limited to purchase items within a specific *category*, select them
  using the drop-down menu. If this field is left blank, the card may be
  used for *any* expense category.

  Odoo is able to categorize transactions based on the
  `MCC (Merchant Category Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} provided
  by the card network provider (such as Mastercard). Every merchant has
  a corresponding `MCC
  (Merchant Category Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that
  identifies their business and product types. When a Stripe-issued card
  is used, the `MCC (Merchant Category Code)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} is sent with the transaction, allowing Stripe to approve
  or block it based on the card\'s configuration.

  ::: example
  A company issues an expense card that is only authorized for airline,
  train, and taxi travel expenses.

  To configure this, click into the `Category`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field, and click `Search
  more...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the bottom. In the
  `Search: Categories`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window,
  click into the search bar and click
  `Transportation services`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
  `fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Filters`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} column.

  Next, tick the checkboxes next to the desired transportation
  categories. In this example, only `Railroads`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Passenger Railways`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Taxicabs Limousines`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, and `Airlines Air Carriers`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} are selected.

  Click `Select`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the selected
  transportation categories now populate the
  `Categories`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
  :::

- `Limit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Configure the two spending
  limits for the card. The first configuration sets the total expense
  amount allowed during a specific time period. Using the drop-down menu
  after the word `per`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select the
  time period the limit applies to. The available options are:
  `Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Week`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `All Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Next, enter the maximum
  amount allowed for the selected time period.

  Next, set the *per transaction* limit. Enter the maximum amount that
  can be charged on the expense card in a single transaction in the
  field.

  ::: example
  A company allows employees to purchase airline tickets that are less
  than \$1,000.00 total. Additionally, there is a monthly cap of
  \$3,000.00 for all expenses.

  The company would configure the limit as follows:
  [3,000.00]{.title-ref} per `Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  and [1,000.00]{.title-ref} per transaction.
  :::

:::::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Card limits can be modified at any point. Once modified, they
immediately go into effect.

:::: important

:::

All expense cards pull payments from a single Stripe account. It is
recommended to set card limits to avoid large charges or transactions
that may prematurely deplete the expense Stripe account.

## Activate expense cards {#expenses/card-activate}

Once an expense card is configured, the next step is to activate the
cards. First, navigate to `Expenses app --> Cards`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and the `Cards`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard loads, displaying all expense cards in a
Kanban view.

All cards display their status on a banner in the upper-right corner of
each card. Statuses are either:

- `Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The card form is filled
  out, but the card has not been requested or activated.
- `Pending`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A physical card has been
  ordered, but not activated.
- `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The card is able to be
  used. This status does **not** display a status banner on the card.
- `Paused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A card has been put *on
  hold* and no transactions can be processed with this status.
- `Blocked`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The physical or virtual
  card is *cancelled* and cannot be used.

Click on a card to activate, and the card form loads. Ensure all the
fields are `configured
<expenses/card-configure>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, then click
either `Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if requesting a
physical card, or `Activate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if
creating a virtual card.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Physical cards take 5 to 10 business days to be delivered. Once ordered,
delivery information is added to the chatter, and the user who placed
the card order receives the information by email.
::::

If a physical card is requested, the card status changes to
`Inactive`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, while it is being printed
and mailed to the selected address. Once the card arrives, follow the
included instructions to activate the card.

If the card is a virtual card, once `Activate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is clicked, the status changes to
`Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and it is available for use.

Once the status of an expense card is `Active`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, the user can use the card to purchase expensable
items, as long as the purchases are within the limits set on the card.

## Demo expense card

To test the expense card feature without using a live Stripe account,
`install
<general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the [Expense Cards:
Demo]{.title-ref} module. This replaces production functionalities and
allows for the creation of a demo Stripe account, using virtual cards

## Using expense cards

Using an expense card is almost identical to using any other credit or
debit card. The only difference is if a
`physical card <expenses/physical>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or a
`virtual card
<expenses/virtual>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is used.

When a charge is made using an expense card, an expense record is
automatically created in the **Expenses** app, linked to the specific
card. The next step is to attach the corresponding receipt.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It is best proactive to take a photo of a receipt as soon as it is
received, to eliminate the risk of losing the receipt and having an
expense reimbursement request denied.
::::

Open the expense record by navigating to
`Expenses app --> Cards`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
click on the specific card. Next, click the `fa-usd`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button,
and the `Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard loads
for that card. Any expense that does *not* have a receipt attached to
the record displays a `fa-credit-card`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Please upload the receipt.`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

Click on the desired expense record to open the detailed expense form.
Click the `Attach
Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and a file explorer
loads. Navigate to the receipt, and click `Open`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to select it and attach it to the expense.

Make any other adjustments to
`the expense record <expenses/manual_expense>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, if necessary. Once the record is correct, click
`Submit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to submit the receipt, or
`Split`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, if the receipt needs to be
split between multiple expenses.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If a purchase is attempted that either is outside the listed countries,
listed categories, or exceeds the transaction limit or total expense
limit for the specified time period, the expense is denied and captured
in the `Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard for the
card, with a status of *Refused*.

To view the details of why the transaction was refused, click on the
`fa-usd`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Expenses`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button for the card, and click on the refused
transaction. The details explaining why the transaction was refused
appears in the chatter, authored by *OdooBot*.
::::

## Physical card {#expenses/physical}

When using a physical card, make charges in the same manner as a regular
physical pre-paid debit card.

Once the user receives the card, the cardholder must activate the card
using the instructions provided with the card. Next, open the
**Expenses** app, and click on the physical card, which has a status of
`Pending`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click
`Activate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then when prompted, enter
the last four digits of the card, confirm the phone number, accept the
terms and conditions, and complete the activation.

### Card PIN

To view the card\'s PIN, the cardholder **must** have a
`user <../../general/users>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} profile.
Navigate to `Expenses app --> Cards`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click on the card to open the card form.
Enter the six-digit code sent via SMS to the associated phone number.
The card and its PIN appear in a pop-up window. The PIN is displayed
below the card and **cannot** be changed.

## Virtual card {#expenses/virtual}

If using a virtual card, the cardholder **must** have a
`user <../../general/users>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} profile to
access the card information required for purchases.

To obtain the card information, navigate to
`Expenses app --> Cards`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
click on the virtual card being used. Next, click into the
`Card Details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and two items
appear: the expense card number, with only the last four digits
displayed, and the expiration date.

To view the full details, click `fa-eye`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`View Details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a `Two-Factor
Authentication`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window loads.
Enter the six-digit authentication code that is texted to the
cardholder\'s phone number. The card appears in the pop-up window, with
all the information displayed: the card number, expiration date, and
security code. When done, close the window by clicking
`X`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip

Android users can add their virtual expense cards [to a Google
wallet](https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12058983?hl=en).
::::

## Lost cards

When a physical card is lost, or if credentials for a virtual card have
been compromised, the cards must be updated in the **Expenses** app so
they cannot be used. This is referred to in Odoo as *blocking*.

To stop any charges on a card, navigate to
`Expenses app --> Cards`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
click on the specific card being deactivated. On the card form, click
the `Block`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and a
`Block a Card`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window loads.

Click into the field next to `Reason`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and select the reason the card is being blocked. The
options are `Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Stolen`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Other`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. After making a selection,
click `Block`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the card is unable
to be used, and a red `Blocked`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
banner appears on the card in the `Cards`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard view.

::: example
An employee is given a virtual expense card to use for an upcoming
business trip. The employee uses this card to purchase an airline ticket
and a hotel room, one month before the scheduled trip.

A week before the trip, they receive an email from the airline,
explaining there has been a data breach, and customer names, contact
information, and purchase details including credit card numbers have
been leaked.

The employee reaches out to their manager, explaining the situation. The
manager opens the virtual expense card, and blocks the card using the
reason `Other`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then the manager
issues another virtual card for the employee to use for their business
trip.
:::

## Temporary card pauses

When an employee is out of office for an extended period of time, such
as a vacation, or an illness, it is recommended to temporarily
deactivate their card to prevent any fraudulent charges. This is
referred to in Odoo as *pausing* a card.

To pause a card, navigate to `Expenses app --> Cards`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click on the specific card being paused. On
the card form, click `Pause`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
card is unable to be used until it is activated.

::: example
An employee in the sales department has a physical expense card to use
for client meetings. They recently welcomed a new child, and will be out
of office on parental leave for three months.

On the employee\'s last day, their manager opens the expense card
record, and clicks `Pause`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. When the
employee returns to work, the manager opens the expense card form and
clicks `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to reactivate the
card.

# Expense categories

Odoo **Expenses** streamlines the management of expenses. After an
employee `logs
<../expenses/log_expenses>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
`submits <../expenses/submit_expenses>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
their expenses in Odoo, expenses are reviewed by management and
accounting teams. Once `approved
<../expenses/approve_expenses>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, payments
can be processed and `disbursed back to the employee
<../expenses/reimburse>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} for
reimbursement.

::: seealso
[Odoo Expenses: product page](https://www.odoo.com/app/expenses)
:::

## View expense categories

The first step to track expenses is configuring the different types of
expenses for the company (managed as *expense categories* in Odoo). Each
category can be as specific or generalized as needed. Additionally,
expense categories can be configured to repay expenses at either a set
price or allow for specific prices to be reported.

To view the default expense categories, navigate to
`Expenses app --> Configuration
--> Expense Categories`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

The default expense categories allow creating expenses for common
expenses, including communication costs, meals, gifts, miles driven, and
other travel expenses. For expenses outside these default categories,
the general expenses category, `EXP_GEN`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, is used. If a company has specific expenses it
commonly reimburses, and wants to track them separately,
`new expense categories
can be made <expenses/new-category>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or
existing expense categories can be modified.

![Set expense costs on products.](expense_categories/default-categories.png)

## Create new expense categories {#expenses/new-category}

Some companies require more expense categories than the **Expenses** app
includes. For these situations, new expense categories can be created.

::: example
A company that trains car mechanics allows its technicians to purchase
\$500 worth of tools in a year. In this situation, the company creates a
new category called [TOOLS]{.title-ref} to track all tool expenses.
:::

To create a new expense category, navigate to
`Expenses app --> Configuration -->
Expense Categories`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a new expense category
form loads.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Expense *categories* are managed like *products* in Odoo. The expense
category form follows the standard product form in Odoo, and the
information entered is similar. Expense *products* are referred to as
expense *categories* throughout this document since the main menu refers
to these as `Expense Categories`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

Enter the following fields on the form:

- `Product Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a name for
  the category that is short and informative.

- `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If employees can report the
  actual cost of an expense, and are reimbursed the reported amount,
  leave the field set to [0.00]{.title-ref}. If the expense should
  **always** be reimbursed for a specific price, enter the amount in
  this field. If a price is entered, a `per`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field appears with `Unit`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} populated by default. `Unit`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} covers most expense situations, but if the
  reimbursement is based on weight, length, volume, etc., choose the
  corresponding type of unit using the drop-down menu.

  ::: example
  Here are some examples for when to set a specific
  `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on a product vs. leaving the
  `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at \`0.00\`:

  - **Meals**: If employees are reimbursed for their full meal cost, set
    the `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to [0.00]{.title-ref}.
    When an employee logs an expense for a meal, they enter the actual
    amount of the bill and are reimbursed for that amount. An expense
    for a meal costing \$95.23 would equal a reimbursement of \$95.23.
  - **Mileage**: If employees receive a flat rate for each mile they
    drive, set the `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
    [1.00]{.title-ref}. When an employee logs an expense for the miles
    driven, they enter the number of miles driven in the
    `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and are
    reimbursed \$1.00 per mile they reported. An expense for 100 miles
    would equal a reimbursement of \$100.00.
  - **Per Diem**: If employees receive a daily flat rate of \$125.00
    when traveling, set the `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
    [125.00]{.title-ref}. An expense for three days of per diem costs
    (meals, incidentals, taxi fare, etc.) would equal a reimbursement of
    \$375.00.
  :::

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  The `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is always visible
  on the expense category form, but the `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field is *only* visible if the
  `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected under the
  `Re-Invoice Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.
  Otherwise, the `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
  is hidden.
  ::::

- `Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a short
  reference for the expense, such as [FOOD]{.title-ref} or
  [TRAVEL]{.title-ref}. This reference is used when
  `emailing expenses <expenses/email_expense>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

- `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the category the expense falls under. It is recommended
  to use the default category [All / Expenses]{.title-ref}, but another
  category can be selected if the accounting department requires it.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If in a multi-company
  database, select the company the expense category applies to. If the
  expense category applies to *all* companies, leave this field blank.

- `Guideline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter some rules or
  important information for the expense category. This is visible in the
  `Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column on the
  `Expense Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

  ::: example
  An expense category for expenses related to working from home may have
  a `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of [WFH]{.title-ref}, and
  the `Guideline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} may say [Monitors,
  Chairs, & Other Home Working Costs]{.title-ref}.
  :::

- `Expense Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If using the
  Odoo **Accounting** app, select the `CoA (Chart of
  Accounts)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} the expense should be logged
  on.

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  Check with the accounting department to determine the correct account
  to reference in this field as it affects various reports.
  ::::

- `Purchase Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Sales Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the default
  taxes that are applied when purchasing or selling this product, if
  applicable.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  The `Sales Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is **only**
  visible if the **Sales** app is installed, and either the
  `At cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options are selected
  in the `invoicing section <expenses/invoicing>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
  ::::

  :::: tip
  ::: title
  Tip
  :::

  It is considered good practice to use a tax that is configured with
  `Tax Included in Price
  <taxes/included-in-price>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Taxes are
  automatically configured if these are set.
  ::::

![A new expense category for tools.](expense_categories/new-expense-category.png)

### Invoicing section {#expenses/invoicing}

If the **Sales** app is installed, an invoicing section is visible. This
section allows the expense to be reinvoiced to customers on sales
orders.

If the expense **cannot** be reinvoiced, enable the
`No`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. If the expense category
**can** be reinvoiced, enable either of these options:

- `At cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this option to
  have the expense item reinvoiced at the price set in the
  `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
- `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this option
  to have the expense item reinvoiced at the sales price. When enabled,
  a `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears
  beneath the `Product Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
  Enter the sales price in the new field.

::: example
A heating and cooling company offers at-home repairs on the furnaces and
central air units it sells. Their technicians are sub-contracted, and
use their own vans, tools, and parts.

As part of their contracts, technicians are reimbursed for their travel.
They receive \$1.00 for every mile they drive. Additionally, the
customer must pay for the travel as part of their service contract. The
customer pays \$1.50 for every mile the technician drives to their
location.

To configure this expense, the `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is set to [1.50]{.title-ref} and the
`Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to [1.00]{.title-ref}.

# Expenses analysis

It is important for companies to track expenses so they have an
understanding of their expenses and can identify trends. Expense
reporting allows for detailed information, such as which expense
categories are reimbursed the most, which employees incur the most
expenses, and if there are any periods of time that tend to incur more
expenses than others.

## View expense analysis report

To view the default *Expenses Analysis* report, navigate to
`Expenses app -->
Reporting --> Expenses Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. The `Expenses Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} report displays all expenses for the current year, in a
stacked bar chart, grouped by month.

![The default stacked bar chart for annual expenses, grouped by month.](expenses_analysis/default-report.png)

## View expenses by employee

It is possible to view the data so that the total cost of expenses *by
employee* is visible. To view the report in this way, navigate to
`Expenses app --> Reporting --> Expenses
Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Next, click the
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to view the data in a
pivot table.

This presents the data with the *employees* populating the rows, and the
*total monthly expenses* populate the columns. Next, click
`fa-minus-square-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the monthly
columns to hide the individual monthly totals, and present only the
*total* amount for the year.

To present the data in either ascending or descending total, click the
`Total In Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box, and the
information is organized first in ascending order, starting with the
smallest amount. Click `Total In Currency`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} again to reverse the order, and present the highest
amount first.

::: example
In this example it can be determined that `Mike Smith`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} has the highest amount of expenses, totaling
`4,216.44`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This is almost seven
times higher than `Ronnie
Hart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, who has the second highest
expenses, with a total of `644.74`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![A pivot table with the information shown by employee, in descending order.](expenses_analysis/by-employee.png)
:::

## View expenses by category

It is possible to view the data so that the total cost of expenses *by
category* is visible. To view the report in this way, navigate to
`Expenses app --> Reporting --> Expenses
Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Next, click the
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to view the data in a
pivot table.

This presents the data with the *employees* populating the rows, and the
*total monthly expenses* populate the columns. Next, click
`fa-minus-square-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the employees
column. Click `fa-plus-square`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that appears in place of
`fa-minus-square-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, revealing a drop-down menu
of options. Click `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
expense categories now populate the rows.

Next, click `fa-minus-square-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the months
column to hide the individual months, and only show the annual total for
each category.

To present the data in either ascending or descending total, click the
`Total In Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box, and the
information is organized first in ascending order, starting with the
smallest amount. Click `Total In Currency`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} again to reverse the order, and present the highest
amount first.

::: example
In this example, it can be determined that the company spent the most on
travel expenses, with the expense category
`[TRANS & ACC] Travel & Accommodation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} incurring `2,940.00`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
of expenses for the year. The company reimbursed mileage the least, with
only `229.69`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
`[MIL] Mileage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} expenses.

# Log expenses

Before expenses can be reimbursed, each individual expense needs to be
logged in the database. Expense records can be created in four different
ways: `manually enter an expense record
<expenses/manual_expense>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`upload a receipt <expenses/upload_receipt>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `drag and drop
<expenses/drag_and_drop>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} a receipt onto
the **Expenses** app dashboard, or `email a receipt
<expenses/email_expense>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to a
preconfigured email address.

## Manually enter expenses {#expenses/manual_expense}

To record a new expense, open the **Expenses** app, which displays the
`My Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, by default.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

This view can also be accessed at any time by navigating to
`Expenses app --> My
Expenses --> My Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
::::

Click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and fill out
the following fields on the blank expense form that loads:

- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a short
  description for the expense. This should be concise and informative,
  such as [Lunch with client]{.title-ref} or [Hotel for trade
  show]{.title-ref}.

- `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the `expense category
  <expense_categories>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} that most closely
  corresponds to the expense.

- `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the total amount
  paid for the expense in one of two ways:

  1.  If the expense is for a single item/expense, and the category
      selected was for a single item, enter the cost in the
      `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field (the
      `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is hidden).

  2.  If the expense is for multiples of the same item/expense with a
      fixed price, the `Unit Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
      is displayed. Enter the number of units in the
      `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and the total
      cost is automatically updated with the correct total. The total
      cost appears below the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"}.

      ::: example
      An employee received one dollar for each mile driven for work. The
      `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
      `[MIL] Mileage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
      `Unit Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is automatically
      populated with [\$1.00]{.title-ref}, which is the cost *per mile*
      configured for the expense `Category`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"} `[MIL] Mileage`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"}. The `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"} is set to [48]{.title-ref}, which is the *number
      of miles driven*, and the total is calculated to
      [\$48.00]{.title-ref}.
      :::

- `Included Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If taxes were
  configured on the selected expense category, the tax percentage and
  amount appear automatically after entering either the
  `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or the
  `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  When a tax is configured on an expense category, the
  `Included Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} value updates in
  real time, as the `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is updated.
  ::::

- `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the employee associated with the expense.

- `Paid By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Click the radio button
  to indicate who paid for the expense and should be reimbursed. Select
  either `Employee (to reimburse)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Depending on the expense
  category selected, this field may not appear.

- `Expense Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the calendar
  popover window that appears when this field is clicked, enter the date
  the expense was incurred.

- `Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the selected expense
  `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} has a specific account
  linked to it, that account appears in the `Account`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field. If no account is specified, the default
  [600000 Expenses]{.title-ref} account populates this field. If a
  different account is desired, select the account the expense should be
  logged in.

- `Customer to Reinvoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the
  expense should be paid for by a customer and the selected
  `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} allows for reinvoicing
  of expenses, select the `SO (Sales
  Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and customer to be invoiced for
  the expense using the drop-down menu. All sales orders in the
  drop-down menu list both the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"}, as well as the company the sales order is written for.
  After the expense is saved, the customer name disappears, and only the
  `SO
  (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is visible on the
  expense.

  ::: example
  A customer wishes to have an on-site meeting for the design and
  installation of a custom building, and agrees to pay for all expenses
  associated with the meeting, including travel, hotel, and meals for
  the traveling employees. All expenses tied to that meeting would
  indicate the sales order for the custom building (which also
  references the customer) as the
  `Customer to Reinvoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  :::

- `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  account the expense should be written against from the drop-down menu
  for either `Projects`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Departments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or both. Multiple
  accounts can be listed for each category, if needed. Adjust the
  percentage for each analytic account by typing in the percentage value
  next to each account.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If in a multi-company
  database, select the company the expense should be filed for using the
  drop-down menu. The current company automatically populates this
  field.

- `Notes...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If any notes are needed
  to clarify the expense, enter them in the notes field.

![A filled in expense form for a client lunch.](log_expenses/expense-filled-in.png)

### Attach receipts

After the expense record is created, the next step is to attach a
receipt. Click the `Attach Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button, and a file explorer appears. Navigate to the receipt to be
attached, and click `Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The new receipt is recorded in the *chatter*, and the number of receipts
appears next to the `fa-paperclip`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(paperclip)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon. Multiple receipts
can be attached to an individual expense record, as needed.

## Upload expenses {#expenses/upload_receipt}

It is possible to have expense records created automatically by
`uploading a PDF receipt
<expenses/upload>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. To utilize this
feature, a setting must be enabled, and `IAP (in-app
purchases)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} credits must be purchased.

### Digitalization settings {#expenses/digitalization}

To enable receipt scanning, navigate to
`Expenses app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and tick the checkbox
beside the `Expense Digitization (OCR)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option. Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. When enabled, additional options appear. Click on the

- `Do not digitize`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Disables receipt
  digitization but does *not* uninstall the related digitization module.
- `Digitize on demand only`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Only
  digitizes receipts when requested. A `Digitize

When the `Expense Digitization (OCR)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option is enabled, a necessary module is installed, so receipts can be
scanned. Disabling this option uninstalls the module.

If, at some point, there is a desire to temporarily stop digitizing
receipts, select the `Do not digitize`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option. The reason this option is available is so the
module is not uninstalled, allowing for digitization to be enabled in
the future by selecting one of the other two options.

### Upload receipts {#expenses/upload}

Open the `Expenses app`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and from the
`My Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, click
`Upload`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a file explorer
appears. Navigate to the desired receipt, select it, then click
`Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The receipt is scanned, and a new expense record is created. The
`Expense Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is populated
with today\'s date, along with any other fields based on the scanned
data, such as the `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Click on the new entry to open the individual expense form, and make any
changes, if needed. The scanned receipt appears in the *chatter*.

## Drag and drop an expense {#expenses/drag_and_drop}

If
`digitalization is enabled <expenses/digitalization>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, drag and drop a receipt onto the **Expenses** app
dashboard. The receipt is scanned and appears by itself on the `Generate
Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

Click on the expense record, and modify the details as needed. After
changes are made, return to the `My Expenses`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard, and the expense now appears in the list.

## Email expenses {#expenses/email_expense}

Instead of individually creating each expense in the **Expenses** app,
expenses can be automatically created by sending an email to an email
alias.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

For security purposes, only authenticated employee emails are accepted
by Odoo when creating an expense from an email. To confirm an
authenticated employee email address, go to the employee card in the
`Employees app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and refer to
the `Work Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![Create the domain alias by clicking the link.](log_expenses/authenticated-email-address.png)
::::

To do so, an email alias must first be configured. Navigate to
`Expenses app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Ensure the checkbox beside `Incoming Emails`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is ticked. The default email alias is
*expense@(domain).com*. Change the email alias by entering the desired
email in the field to the right of `Alias`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the domain alias needs to be set up,
`fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Setup your domain
alias`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears beneath the
`Incoming Emails`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox, instead
of the email address field.

Refer to the
`/applications/websites/website/configuration/domain_names`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation for setup instructions and more information.

Once the domain alias is configured, the email address field is visible
beneath the `Incoming Emails`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature
on the `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page in the
**Expenses** app.
::::

Once the email address has been entered, emails can be sent to that
alias to create new expenses, without having to be in the Odoo database.

To submit an expense via email, create a new email, and enter the
product\'s *reference* code (if available) and the amount of the expense
as the subject of the email. Next, attach the receipt to the email. Odoo
creates the expense by taking the information in the email subject, and
combining it with the receipt.

:::: tip

Tip
:::

To check an expense category\'s reference code, go to `Expenses app -->
Configuration --> Expense Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Reference codes are listed in the
`Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

To add a reference code to an expense category, click on the category to
open the expense category form. Enter the reference code in the
`Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![Reference categories displayed in the main Expense Categories view.](log_expenses/ref.png)
::::

::: example
If submitting an expense, via email, for a \$25.00 meal during a work
trip, the email subject would be [FOOD \$25.00]{.title-ref}.

Explanation:

- The `Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the expense
  category [Meals]{.title-ref} is [FOOD]{.title-ref}
- The `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the expense is
  [\$25.00]{.title-ref}

# Reimburse employees

After an expense report is
`posted to an accounting journal <../expenses/post_expenses>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, the next step is to reimburse the employee. Employees can
be reimbursed via cash, check, or direct deposit in three ways:

- `Individually <expenses/reimburse-single>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: Each individual expense report is reimbursed separately.
- `In bulk <expenses/reimburse-bulk>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:
  Multiple expense reports are reimbursed in a single payment.
- `In the employee's payslip <expenses/reimburse-payslip>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: Expense reports are reimbursed directly in the
  employee\'s payslip.

## Reimbursement settings {#expenses/reimburse-settings}

Reimbursements can be paid via a paycheck, check, cash, or bank transfer
(usually referred to as direct deposit). To set up payment options,
first configure the various settings by navigating to
`Expenses app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

To reimburse employees for expenses
`in their paychecks <expenses/reimburse-payslip>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, tick the checkbox beside the
`Reimburse in Payslip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option in the
`Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

Next, set how payments are made in the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section. Click the drop-down menu under
`Payment Methods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select the
desired payment option. The default options include paying by
`Manual Payment (Cash)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Manual Payment (Bank)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Batch Deposit (Bank)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Checks (Bank)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Leaving this field blank allows for **all** available payment options to
be used.

When all desired configurations are complete, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to activate the settings.

## Reimburse in payslips {#expenses/reimburse-payslip}

If the *Reimburse in Payslip* option is activated on the `settings
<expenses/reimburse-settings>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} page,
payments can be added to the employee\'s next payslip, instead of
issuing separate payments.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Reimbursing expenses on payslips can **only** be done individually for
an *approved* expense report. Once an expense report has a status of
*Posted*, the option to reimburse in the following payslip **is not
available**.
::::

Navigate to `Expenses app --> Expense Reports`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click on the individual expense report to
reimburse on the following paycheck. Click the
`Report in Next Payslip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and
the expenses are added to the next payslip issued for that employee.

![The Report in Next Payslip button, visible with an expense report status of Approved.](reimburse/pay-via-payslip.png)

Once the expense report is added to the following payslip, a message is
logged in the chatter stating [Expense report (expense report name) will
be added to the next payslip.]{.title-ref} The status for the expense
report remains `Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The status
only changes to `Posted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (and then
`Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), when the related payslip is
processed.

reports are presented in a default list view. Click on the expense
report being reimbursed to view the report details.

  trusted bank account on their employee profile, use the drop-down menu
  to select the desired bank account.
- `Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The total amount being
  reimbursed populates this field, by default.
- `Payment Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the date the
  payment is issued in this field. The current date populates this
  field, by default.

# Reinvoice expenses

If expenses are tracked on customer projects, they can be automatically
charged back to the customer. This is done by
`logging an expense <expenses/reinvoice-create>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, referencing the corresponding sales order, and then
`creating an expense report
<expenses/reinvoice-expense-report>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Next, managers
`approve the expense report <expenses/reinvoice-approve>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, then the accounting department
`post the journal entries <expenses/reinvoice-approve>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Finally, once the expense report is posted to a journal, the expenses
appear on the specified `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. When the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
is `invoiced <expenses/reinvoice>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, the
customer is charged for the expenses.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Approving expenses, posting expenses to accounting, and reinvoicing
expenses on `SOs (Sales
Orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is **only** possible for users
with the appropriate `access rights
<../../general/users/access_rights>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
::::

::: seealso
This document provides lower-level instructions for the creation,
submission, approval, and posting of expenses. For fully-detailed
instructions for any of these steps, refer to the following
documentation:

- `Log expenses <../expenses/log_expenses>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}
- `Submit expenses <../expenses/submit_expenses>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}
- `Approve expenses <../expenses/approve_expenses>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}
- `Post expenses <../expenses/post_expenses>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}
:::

## Setup

First, specify the invoicing policy for each expense category. Navigate
to `Expenses
app --> Configuration --> Expense Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click on an expense category to view the expense
category form. Under the `INVOICING`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section, click the radio button next to the desired selection for
`Re-Invoice costs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:

- `No`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The expense category
  **cannot** be reinvoiced.
- `At cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The expense category
  invoices expenses at the `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set
  on the expense category form.
- `Sales price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The expense category
  invoices at the `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set
  on the expense form.

## Log an expense {#expenses/reinvoice-create}

First, when
`creating a new expense <../expenses/log_expenses>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, the correct information needs to be entered to reinvoice
the expense to a customer. Using the drop-down menu, select the `SO
(Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to add the expense to in
the `Customer to Reinvoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Next, select the `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} the expense is posted to. The options available are
pulled from the **Projects** app.

Multiple projects can be selected, if desired. To add another
`Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click on the
line to reveal the `Analytic`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-over window. Click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
then select the desired `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu.

![An expense entry to reinvoice a project to the customer, for the gallery seating project.](reinvoice_expenses/reinvoice-expense-form.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If selecting more than one `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, the `Percentage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
fields **must** be modified. Both fields are populated with
[100%]{.title-ref}, by default. Adjust the percentages for all the
fields, so the total of all selected accounts equals [100%]{.title-ref}.
::::

::: example
A furniture company is building seating for two different locations for
one client. The client agrees to pay for all travel expenses for site
visits related to these two projects. The furniture company plans one
trip to visit *both* locations.

When creating the expenses for travel expenses, **both projects** are
listed in the `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
line, for 50% each.
:::

## Create an expense report {#expenses/reinvoice-expense-report}

After the expenses are created, the expense report must be created and
submitted, in the same manner as all other expenses.

Once the expense report is submitted, a `fa-money`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Sales Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button appears at the top-center of both the expense report, and each
individual expense record being reinvoiced.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Selecting the proper `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
in the `Customer to Reinvoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
is **critical**, since this is how expenses are automatically invoiced
after an expense report is approved.

The `Customer to Reinvoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field can
be modified *only* until an expense report is **approved**. After an
expense report is approved, the
`Customer to Reinvoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is no
longer able to be modified.
::::

![An expense report with a sales order smart button for reinvoicing.](reinvoice_expenses/reinvoice-approved.png)

## Approve and post expenses {#expenses/reinvoice-approve}

Before
`approving an expense report <../expenses/approve_expenses>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, ensure the `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section is populated for every relevant expense line.

If an `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} entry
is missing, assign the correct accounts from the drop-down menu, then
click `Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button **only** appears
after an expense report has been submitted.
::::

The accounting department is typically responsible for
`posting journal entries
<../expenses/post_expenses>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. To post
expenses to an accounting journal, click `Post
Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Once an expense
report is approved, it can then be posted.

The `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is **only**
updated *after* the journal entries are posted. Once the journal entries
are posted, the expenses now appear on the referenced
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

## Invoice expenses {#expenses/reinvoice}

After the expense report has been approved, and the journal entries have
been posted, the `SO
(Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is updated, and the
customer can be invoiced.

Navigate to the expense report, and click the
`fa-money`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Sales Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button to open
the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. The expenses to
be reinvoiced now appear on the `SO
(Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

More than one `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can be
referenced on an expense report. If more than one
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is referenced,
clicking the `Sales Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button opens a list displaying all the
`SOs (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} associated with that
expense report. Click on a `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} to open the individual `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} details.
::::

The expenses are listed in the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

Next, click `Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a
`Create invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears. Select if the invoice is a `Regular invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, a `Down payment (percentage)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or a `Down payment (fixed amount)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, click `Create Draft`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Doing so creates a draft invoice for the customer.
Click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the
invoice, and the customer is invoiced for the expenses.

# Submit expenses

When expenses have been `logged <log_expenses>`{.interpreted-text

expenses can then be reimbursed.

## My expenses dashboard {#expenses/my_expenses}

Open the **Expenses** app, which displays the
`My Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, by default.
Alternatively, navigate to
`Expenses app --> My Expenses --> My Expenses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

All expenses are color-coded by status. Any expense with a status of
`Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (expenses that have been
created but not submitted) appears in blue text. For all other statuses
(`Submitted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Refused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), the text appears in
black.

Above the list of expenses is the total monetary value of all expenses
waiting to be submitted, waiting for approval, or waiting for
reimbursement. Expenses with a status of `Draft`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} are used to calculate the amount in the
`To Submit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, expenses with a
status of `Submitted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are used to
calculate the `Waiting Approval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
amount, and expenses with a status of `Approved`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} are used to calculate the
`Waiting Reimbursement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} total.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Configure your company {#argentina/configure-your-company}

Once the localization modules are installed, the first step is to set up
the company\'s data. In addition to the basic information, a key field
to fill in is the `AFIP Responsibility
Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which represents the fiscal
obligation and structure of the company.

![Select AFIP Responsibility Type.](argentina/select-responsibility-type.png){.align-center}

### Chart of account

In Accounting, there are three different
`Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} packages to
choose from. They are based on a company\'s AFIP responsibility type,
and consider the difference between companies that do not require as
many accounts as the companies that have more complex fiscal
requirements:

- Monotributista (227 accounts);
- IVA Exento (290 accounts);
- Responsable Inscripto (298 Accounts).

![Select Fiscal Localization Package.](argentina/select-fiscal-package.png){.align-center}

### Configure master data

#### Electronic Invoice Credentials

##### Environment

The AFIP infrastructure is replicated in two separate environments,
**testing** and **production**.

Testing is provided so that the companies can test their databases until
they are ready to move into the **Production** environment. As these two
environments are completely isolated from each other, the digital
certificates of one instance are not valid in the other one.

To select a database environment, go to
`Accounting --> Settings --> Argentinean
Localization`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and choose either
`Prueba (Testing)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Produccion (Production)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Select AFIP database environment: Testing or Production.](argentina/select-environment.png){.align-center}

##### AFIP certificates

The electronic invoice and other AFIP services work with
`Web Services (WS)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} provided by the
AFIP.

In order to enable communication with the AFIP, the first step is to
request a `Digital
Certificate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if you do not have one
already.

1.  `Generate Certificate Sign Request (Odoo)`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}. When this option is selected, a file with
    extension [.csr]{.title-ref} (certificate signing request) is
    generated to be used in the AFIP portal to request the certificate.

    ![Request a certificate.](argentina/request-certificate.png)

2.  `Generate Certificate (AFIP)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
    Access the AFIP portal and follow the instructions described in
    [this
    document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17OKX2lNWd1bjUt3NxfqcCKBkBh-Xlpo-/view)
    to get a certificate.

3.  `Upload Certificate and Private Key (Odoo)`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}. Once the certificate is generated, upload it to
    Odoo using the `Pencil`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon next
    to the field `Certificado`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
    select the corresponding file.

    ![Upload Certificate and Private Key.](argentina/upload-certificate-private-key.png)

In case you need to configure the Homologation Certificate, please refer
to the AFIP official documentation: [Homologation
Certificate](http://www.afip.gob.ar/ws/documentacion/certificados.asp).
Furthermore, Odoo allows the user to test electronic invoicing locally
without a Homologation Certificate. The following message will be in the
chatter when testing locally:

#### Partner

##### Identification type and VAT

As part of the Argentinean localization, document types defined by the
AFIP are now available in the **Partner form**. Information is essential
for most transactions. There are six
`Identification Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} available by
default, as well as 32 inactive types.

![A list of AR Localization document types in Odoo, as defined by AFIP.](argentina/identification-types.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The complete list of `Identification Types`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} defined by the AFIP is included in Odoo, but only the
common ones are active.
::::

##### AFIP responsibility type

In Argentina, the document type and corresponding transactions
associated with customers and vendors is defined by the AFIP
Responsibility type. This field should be defined in the **Partner
form**.

![Select AFIP Responsibility Type.](argentina/select-afip-responsibility-type.png){.align-center}

#### Taxes

As part of the localization module, the taxes are created automatically
with their related financial account and configuration, e.g., 73 taxes
for `Responsable Inscripto`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![A list of AR Localization taxes with financial amount and configuration in Odoo.](argentina/automatic-tax-configuration.png){.align-center}

##### Taxes types

Argentina has several tax types, the most common ones are:

- `VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this is the regular VAT and
  can have various percentages;
- `Perception`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: advance payment of a
  tax that is applied on invoices;
- `Retention`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: advance payment of a
  tax that is applied on payments.

##### Special taxes

Some Argentinean taxes are not commonly used for all companies, and
those less common options are labeled as inactive in Odoo by default.
Before creating a new tax, be sure to check if that tax is not already
included as inactive.

![A list showing less common Argentinean tax options, which are labeled as inactive in Odoo
by default.](argentina/special-inactive-taxes.png){.align-center}

#### Document types

In some Latin American countries, like Argentina, some accounting
transactions such as invoices and vendor bills are classified by
document types defined by the governmental fiscal authorities. In
Argentina, the [AFIP](https://www.afip.gob.ar/) is the governmental
fiscal authority that defines such transactions.

The document type is an essential piece of information that needs to be
clearly displayed in printed reports, invoices, and journal entries that
list account moves.

Each document type can have a unique sequence per journal where it is
assigned. As part of the localization, the document type includes the
country in which the document is applicable (this data is created
automatically when the localization module is installed).

The information required for the `Document Types`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is included by default so the user does not need to
fill anything on this view:

![A list of document types in Odoo.](argentina/default-document-type-info.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

There are several `Document Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
types that are inactive by default, but can be activated as needed.
::::

##### Letters

For Argentina, the `Document Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
include a letter that helps indicate the type of transaction or
operation. For example, when an invoice is related to a(n):

- `B2B transaction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a document type
  `A`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be used;
- `B2C transaction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a document type
  `B`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be used;
- `Exportation Transaction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
  document type `E`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be used.

The documents included in the localization already have the proper
letter associated with each `Document Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, so there is no further configuration necessary.

![document types grouped by letters.](argentina/document-types-grouped-by-letters.png){.align-center}

##### Use on invoices

The `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on each
transaction will be determined by:

- The journal entry related to the invoice (if the journal uses
  documents);
- The onditions applied based on the type of issuer and receiver (e.g.,
  the type of fiscal regime of the buyer and the type of fiscal regime
  of the vendor).

### Journals

In the Argentinean localization, the journal can have a different
approach depending on its usage and internal type. To configure
journals, go to `Accounting --> Configuration -->
Journals`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

For sales and purchase journals, it\'s possible to activate the option
`Use Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which enables a list
of `Document Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that can be
related to the invoices and vendor bills. For more detail on invoices,
please refer to the section `2.3 document types
<document-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

If the sales or purchase journals do not have the
`Use Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option activated,
they will not be able to generate fiscal invoices, meaning, their use
case will be mostly limited to monitoring account moves related to
internal control processes.

#### AFIP information (also known as AFIP Point of Sale)

The `AFIP POS System`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is a field only
visible for the **Sales** journals and defines the type of AFIP POS that
will be used to manage the transactions for which the journal is
created.

The AFIP POS defines the following:

1.  the sequences of document types related to the web service;
2.  the structure and data of the electronic invoice file.

![A AFIP POS System field which is available on Sales journals in Odoo.](argentina/sales-journal.png){.align-center}

##### Web services

**Web services** help generate invoices for different purposes. Below
are a few options to choose from:

- `wsfev1: Electronic Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: is
  the most common service, which is used to generate invoices for
  document types A, B, C, M with no detail per item;
- `wsbfev1: Electronic Fiscal Bond`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  is for those who invoice capital goods and wish to access the benefit
  of the Electronic Tax Bonds granted by the Ministry of Economy. For
  more details go to: [Fiscal
  Bond](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/acceder-un-bono-por-fabricar-bienes-de-capital);
- `wsfexv1: Electronic Exportation Invoice`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: is used to generate invoices for international
  customers and transactions that involve exportation processes, the
  document type related is type \"E\".

![Web Services.](argentina/web-services.png){.align-center}

Here are some useful fields to know when working with web services:

- `AFIP POS Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: is the number
  configured in the AFIP to identify the operations related to this AFIP
  POS;
- `AFIP POS Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: is the field
  related to the commercial address registered for the POS, which is
  usually the same address as the company. For example, if a company has
  multiple stores (fiscal locations) then the AFIP will require the
  company to have one AFIP POS per location. This location will be
  printed in the invoice report;
- `Unified Book`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: when the AFIP POS
  System is Preimpresa, then the document types (applicable to the
  journal) with the same letter will share the same sequence. For
  example:
  - Invoice: FA-A 0001-00000002;
  - Credit Note: NC-A 0001-00000003;
  - Debit Note: ND-A 0001-00000004.

#### Sequences

For the first invoice, Odoo synchronizes with the AFIP automatically and
displays the last sequence used.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When creating `Purchase Journals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
it\'s possible to define whether they are related to document types or
not. In the case where the option to use documents is selected, there
would be no need to manually associate the document type sequences,
since the document number is provided by the vendor.
::::

## Usage and testing

### Invoice

The information below applies to invoice creation once the partners and
journals are created and properly configured.

#### Document type assignation

When the partner is selected, the `Document Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field will be filled in automatically based on the AFIP
document type:

- **Invoice for a customer IVA Responsable Inscripto, prefix A** is the
  type of document that shows all the taxes in detail along with the
  customer\'s information.

  ![Invoice for a customer IVA Responsable Inscripto, prefix A.](argentina/prefix-a-invoice-for-customer.png)

- **Invoice for an end customer, prefix B** is the type of document that
  does not detail the taxes, since the taxes are included in the total
  amount.

  ![Invoice for an end customer, prefix B.](argentina/prefix-b-invoice-for-end-customer.png)

- **Exportation Invoice, prefix E** is the type of document used when
  exporting goods that shows the incoterm.

  ![Exportation Invoice, prefix E](argentina/prefix-e-exporation-invoice.png)

Even though some invoices use the same journal, the prefix and sequence
are given by the `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

The most common `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} will
be defined automatically for the different combinations of AFIP
responsibility type but it can be updated manually by the user before
confirming the invoice.

#### Electronic invoice elements

When using electronic invoices, if all the information is correct then
the invoice is posted in the standard way unless there is an error that
needs to be addressed. When error messages pop up, they indicate both
the issue that needs attention along with a proposed solution. If an
error persists, the invoice remains in draft until the issue is
resolved.

Once the invoice is posted, the information related to the AFIP
validation and status is displayed in the AFIP tab, including:

- `AFIP Autorisation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: CAE number;
- `Expiration Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: deadline to
  deliver the invoice to the customers (normally 10 days after the CAE
  is generated);
- `Result:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} indicates if the invoice
  has been `Aceptado en AFIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and/or
  `Aceptado con Observaciones`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![AFIP Status.](argentina/afip-status.png){.align-center}

#### Invoice taxes

Based on the `AFIP Responsibility type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, the VAT tax can apply differently on the PDF report:

- `A. Tax excluded`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: in this case the
  taxed amount needs to be clearly identified in the report. This
  condition applies when the customer has the following AFIP
  Responsibility type of **Responsable Inscripto**;

  ![Tax excluded.](argentina/tax-amount-excluded.png)

- `B. Tax amount included`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this
  means that the taxed amount is included as part of the product price,
  subtotal, and totals. This condition applies when the customer has the
  following AFIP Responsibility types:

  - IVA Sujeto Exento;
  - Consumidor Final;
  - Responsable Monotributo;
  - IVA liberado.

  ![Tax amount included.](argentina/tax-amount-included.png){.align-center}

#### Special use cases

##### Invoices for services

For electronic invoices that include `Services`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, the AFIP requires to report the service starting and
ending date, this information can be filled in the tab
`Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Invoices for Services.](argentina/invoices-for-services.png){.align-center}

If the dates are not selected manually before the invoice is validated,
the values will be filled automatically with the first and last day of
the invoice\'s month.

![Service Dates.](argentina/service-dates.png){.align-center}

##### Exportation invoices

Invoices related to `Exportation Transactions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} require that a journal uses the AFIP POS System **Expo
Voucher - Web Service** so that the proper document type(s) can be
associated.

![Exporation journal.](argentina/exporation-journal.png){.align-center}

When the customer selected in the invoice is configured with an AFIP
responsibility type `Cliente / Proveedor del Exterior`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} - `Ley N° 19.640`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
Odoo automatically assigns the:

- Journal related to the exportation Web Service;
- Exportation document type;
- Fiscal position: Compras/Ventas al exterior;
- Concepto AFIP: Products / Definitive export of goods;
- Exempt Taxes.

![Export invoice fields autofilled in Odoo.](argentina/export-invoice.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The Exportation Documents require Incoterms to be enabled and
configured, which can be found in
`Other Info --> Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
::::

![Export invoice - Incoterm.](argentina/export-invoice-incoterm.png){.align-center}

##### Fiscal bond

The `Electronic Fiscal Bond`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is used
for those who invoice capital goods and wish to access the benefit of
the Electronic Tax Bonds granted by the Ministry of Economy.

For these transactions, it is important to consider the following
requirements:

- Currency (according to the parameter table) and invoice quotation;
- Taxes;
- Zone;
- Detail each item;
  - Code according to the Common Nomenclator of Mercosur (NCM);
  - Complete description;
  - Unit Net Price;
  - Quantity;
  - Unit of measurement;
  - Bonus;
  - VAT rate.

##### Electronic credit invoice MiPyme (FCE)

For SME invoices, there are several document types that are classified
as **MiPyME**, which are also known as **Electronic Credit Invoice** (or
**FCE** in Spanish). This classification develops a mechanism that
improves the financing conditions for small and medium-sized businesses,
and allows them to increase their productivity, through the early
collection of credits and receivables issued to their clients and/or
vendors.

For these transactions it\'s important to consider the following
requirements:

- specific document types (201, 202, 206, etc);
- the emitter should be eligible by the AFIP to MiPyME transactions;
- the amount should be bigger than 100,000 ARS;
- A bank account type CBU must be related to the emisor, otherwise the
  invoice cannot be validated, having an error message such as the
  following.

![Bank account relation error.](argentina/bank-account-relation-error.png){.align-center}

To set up the `Transmission Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, go
to settings and select either `SDC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
or `ADC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Transmission Mode.](argentina/transmission-mode.png){.align-center}

To change the `Transmission Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
a specific invoice, go to the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab and change it before confirming.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Changing the `Transmission Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} will
not change the mode selected in `Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

![Transmission Mode on Invoice.](argentina/transmission-mode-on-invoice.png){.align-center}

When creating a `Credit/Debit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} note
related to a FCE document:

- use the `Credit and Debit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  buttons, so all the information from the invoice is transferred to the
  new `Credit and Debit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
- the document letter should be the same as than the originator document
  (either A or B);
- the same currency as the source document must be used. When using a
  secondary currency there is an exchange difference if the currency
  rate is different between the emission day and the payment date. It is
  possible to create a credit/debit note to decrease/increase the amount
  to pay in ARS.

![Credit & debit notes buttons.](argentina/credit-debit-notes-button.png){.align-center}

When creating a `Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} we can
have two scenarios:

1.  the FCE is rejected so the `Credit Note`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} should have the field `FCE, is
    Cancellation?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as *True*; or;
2.  the `Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, is created to
    annulate the FCE document, in this case the field
    `FCE, is Cancellation?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be
    *empty* (false).

![FCE: Es Cancelación?](argentina/fce-es-cancelation.png){.align-center}

#### Invoice printed report {#argentina/invoice-printed-report}

The `PDF Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} related to
electronic invoices that have been validated by the AFIP includes a
barcode at the bottom of the format which represents the CAE number. The
expiration date is also displayed as it is a legal requirement.

![Invoice printed report.](argentina/invoice-printed-report.png){.align-center}

#### Troubleshooting and auditing

For auditing and troubleshooting purposes, it is possible to obtain
detailed information of an invoice number that has been previously sent
to the AFIP. To retrieve this information, activate the
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, then go
to the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} menu and
click on the button `Consult Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button in AFIP.

![Consult invoice in AFIP.](argentina/consult-invoice-in-afip.png){.align-center}

![Details of invoice consulted in AFIP.](argentina/consult-invoice-in-afip-details.png){.align-center}

It is also possible to retrieve the last number used in AFIP for a
specific document type and POS Number as a reference for any possible
issues on the sequence synchronization between Odoo and AFIP.

![Consult the last invoice number.](argentina/consult-last-invoice-number.png){.align-center}

### Vendor bills

Based on the purchase journal selected for the vendor bill, the
`Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is now a required
field. This value is auto-populated based on the AFIP Responsibility
type of Issuer and Customer, but the value can be changed if necessary.

![Changing journal and document type.](argentina/changing-journal-document-type.png){.align-center}

The `Document Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field needs to
be registered manually and the format will be validated automatically.
However, in case the format is invalid, a user error will be displayed
indicating the correct format that is expected.

![Vendor bill document number.](argentina/vendor-bill-document-number.png){.align-center}

The vendor bill number is structured in the same way as the customer
invoices, excepted that the document sequence is entered by the user
using the following format: *Document Prefix - Letter -Document Number*.

#### Validate vendor bill number in AFIP

As most companies have internal controls to verify that the vendor bill
is related to an AFIP valid document, an automatic validation can be set
in `Accounting --> Settings -->
Argentinean Localization --> Validate document in the AFIP`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, considering the following levels:

- `Not available:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the verification
  is not done (this is the default value);
- `Available:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the verification is
  done. In case the number is not valid, it only displays a warning but
  still allows the vendor bill to be posted;
- `Required:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the verification is
  done, and it does not allow the user to post the vendor bill if the
  document number is not valid.

![Verify Vendor Bills validity in AFIP.](argentina/verify-vendor-bills.png){.align-center}

##### Validate vendor bills in Odoo

With the vendor validation settings enabled, a new button shows up on
the vendor bills inside of Odoo, labeled
`Verify on AFIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which is located
next to the `AFIP
Authorization code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![Verify on AFIP.](argentina/verify-on-afip.png){.align-center}

In case the vendor bill cannot be validated in AFIP, a value of
`Rejected`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} will be displayed on the
dashboard and the details of the invalidation will be added to the
chatter.

![AFIP authorization Rejected.](argentina/afip-auth-rejected.png){.align-center}

#### Special use cases

##### Untaxed concepts

There are some transactions that include items that are not a part of
the VAT base amount, such as fuel and gasoline invoices.

The vendor bill will be registered using one item for each product that
is part of the VAT base amount, and an additional item to register the
amount of the exempt concept.

![VAT exempt.](argentina/vat-exempt.png){.align-center}

##### Perception taxes

The vendor bill will be registered using one item for each product that
is part of the VAT base amount, and the perception tax can be added in
any of the product lines. As a result, there will be one tax group for
the VAT and another for the perception. The perception default value is
always `0.10`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To edit the VAT perception and set the correct amount, you should use
the `Pencil`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon that is the next to
the `Perception`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} amount. After the
VAT perception amount has been set, the invoice can then be validated.

![Enter the perception amount.](argentina/enter-perception-amount.png){.align-center}

### Withholding management {#l10n_ar/payment-withholdings}

The Argentinean fiscal localization module is already loaded with the
necessary withholdings records, which can be seen by navigating to
`Accounting app --> Configuration -->
Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and removing the default
`Sale or Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter. To verify
these records, the **Argentina Payment Withholdings**
([l10n_ar_withholding]{.title-ref}) module must be `installed
<general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:

Journal entries are *not* created when payments are posted unless
`outstanding accounts
<accounting/journals/outstanding-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are set up. Thus, for this feature to work properly, it is
important to verify that *all* payment methods within the bank journals
have an outstanding payment and receipt account set.

![An outstanding payment account must be set.](argentina/l10n-ar-outstanding-payments.png)

This configuration is crucial for the proper accounting of withholding
transactions with clients and vendors.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In Argentina, withholdings represent the cancellation of a specific
portion of the total debt owed to a supplier or a reduction in the total
payment to be collected from a customer. Therefore, one or multiple
withholdings can be recorded for each payment applied to an invoice.
::::

#### Configuration

While Odoo already creates most of the required withholdings inside the
`Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu, in several cases, it is
necessary to apply or modify certain configurations to correctly
calculate the withholding amount on vendor payments. The following
withholding types are available:

- `Earnings <l10n_ar/earnings-withholdings>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Earnings Scale <l10n_ar/earnings-scale-withholdings>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `IIBB Total Amount <l10n_ar/iib-total-amount-withholdings>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `IIBB Non-Taxable <l10n_ar/iib-nontax-withholdings>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}

##### Earnings {#l10n_ar/earnings-withholdings}

For `Earnings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} withholdings, Odoo
already has a record for each regime group, which is stated under the
name of the tax and the AFIP code.

Each of these records are ready to be used. As a good practice, the
configuration should be double checked to make sure the configuration is
updated and well-applied. The fields to validate are:

- `Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This is the percentage of
  the total payment amount which is withheld.
- `Non-Taxable Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Up to this
  amount, the withholding does not apply.
- `Minimum Withholding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the
  calculated withholding amount is smaller than this value, the total
  withholding amount is set to [0.0]{.title-ref}.
- `Withholding Sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field
  helps to automate the capture of a withholding number under the
  payment line. If this field is not set, a number is manually captured
  while adding a withholding to a payment.

![Earnings withholding type.](argentina/l10n-ar-earnings.png)

##### Earnings Scale {#l10n_ar/earnings-scale-withholdings}

In this particular case, a percentage does not need to be set. Instead,
this withholding is calculated based on the value of the
`Scale`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

To view, modify, or create new scales, navigate to
`Accounting app --> Configuration
--> Earnings Scale`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. By default,
the Argentinian localization is preconfigured with two main scales.
However, scales should be created and updated as necessary to suit a
business\'s needs.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Earnings scales are cumulative, which means that Odoo keeps track of the
different records created for a bill and automatically calculates the
proper withholding amount.
::::

##### IIBB Total Amount {#l10n_ar/iib-total-amount-withholdings}

In this case, the necessary records related to the applicable province
need to be created. The withholding amount is calculated based on the
percentage `Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set on the tax
configuration. Since Odoo does not automatically synchronize the
percentages applicable to each province, this information needs to be
manually updated.

The recommendation, in this case, is to always duplicate and apply the
different configurations for each record to safeguard any technical
configurations that allow the proper calculation and accounting of the
withholding.

##### IIBB Untaxed {#l10n_ar/iib-nontax-withholdings}

The configuration of non-taxable gross income withholdings is very
similar to that of a `total
amount withholding <l10n_ar/iib-total-amount-withholdings>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, so the percentage `Amount`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in each of the records needs to be maintained. However,
Odoo comes preconfigured with several records that apply to different
provinces. The difference, in this case, is that it is not necessary to
establish a non-taxable amount or minimum withholding for this record
type.

#### Partner withholding assignation

Once the proper configuration is set on each possible withholding for
partners, the applicable withholdings need to be assigned to each
contact. To do this, open the `Contacts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} app and select the desired partner. In the
`Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, find the `Purchase
Withholdings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} table.

By using the additional fields `From Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `To Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
applicability of multiple withholdings can be automated across different
date ranges. The `ref`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field allows
you to apply an internal control number to each withholding line, which
is just for internal reference, so it does not affect any transactions
and is not visible on them. These fields are accessible from the
`oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(adjust settings)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu.

- `From Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the start of the
  withholding date range.
- `To Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the end of the
  withholding date range.
- `ref`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: apply an internal control
  number to each withholding line that is only visible for internal
  reference and does not affect any transactions.

#### Automatic withholding calculation and application per payment

By applying new payments to vendor bills, Odoo automatically applies and
calculates the proper withholding into the payment. Based on the
record\'s configuration, it may be necessary to use a reference number
for each withholding line.

More withholdings can be added, or computed withholdings can be edited
if necessary.

![Payment with applied withholdings.](argentina/l10n-ar-payment.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The total amount of the debt to be canceled is the total amount of the
payment. However, Odoo still captures the net amount (i.e. the amount to
be reconciled with the bank), which will be represented as the payment
amount after the withholding application.

![Payment registered form.](argentina/l10n-ar-payment-registered.png)
::::

### Check management

To install the *Third Party and Deferred/Electronic Checks Management*
module, go to `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and search
for the module by its technical name [l10n_latam_check]{.title-ref} and
click the `Activate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![l10n_latam_check module.](argentina/l10n-latam-check-module.png){.align-center}

This module enables the required configuration for journals and payments
to:

- Create, manage, and control your different types of checks
- Optimize the management of *own checks* and *third party checks*
- Have an easy and effective way to manage expiration dates from your
  own and third party checks

Once all the configurations are made for the Argentinian electronic
invoice flow, it is also needed to complete certain configurations for
the own checks and the third party checks flows.

#### Own checks

Configure the bank journal used to create your own checks by going to
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
selecting the bank journal, and opening the `Outgoing
Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

- `Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should be available as a
  `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If not, click
  `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and type
  [Checks]{.title-ref} under `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to add them
- Enable the `Use electronic and deferred checks`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} setting.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This last configuration **disables** the printing ability but enables
to:

- Enter check numbers manually
- Adds a field to allocate the payment date of the check
::::

![Bank journal configurations.](argentina/bank-journal-conf.png){.align-center}

##### Management of own checks

Own checks can be created directly from the vendor bill. For this
process, click on the `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

On the payment registration modal, select the bank journal from which
the payment is to be made and set the
`Check Cash-In Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Payment pop-up window with own check options enabled.](argentina/payment-popup-vendorbill.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To manage current checks, the `Check Cash-In Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field must be left blank or filled in with the current
date. To manage deferred checks, the
`Check Cash-In Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be set in
the future.
::::

To manage your existing own checks, navigate to
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Own
Checks`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. This window shows
critical information such as the dates when checks need to be paid, the
total quantity of checks, and the total amount paid in checks.

![Own checks menu location.](argentina/checks-menu-vendorbill.png){.align-center}

It is important to note that the list is pre-filtered by checks that are
still *not reconciled* with a bank statement - that were not yet debited
from the bank - which can be verified with the
`Is Matched with a Bank Statement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. If you want to see all of your own checks, delete the
`No Bank Matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter by clicking
on the `X`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} symbol.

![Own checks menu organization and filtering.](argentina/check-menu-list-vendorbill.png){.align-center}

##### Cancel an own check

To cancel an own check created in Odoo, navigate to
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Own
Checks`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select the check to
be cancelled, then click on the `Void Check`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. This will break the reconciliation with the
vendor bills and the bank statements and leave the check in a
**cancelled** state.

![Empty Check button to cancel Own Checks](argentina/empty-check-button.png){.align-center}

#### Third party checks

In order to register payments using third party checks, two specific
journals need to be configured. To do so, navigate to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and create two new journals:

- [Third Party Checks]{.title-ref}
- [Rejected Third Party Checks]{.title-ref}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

You can manually create more journals if you have multiple points of
sale and need journals for those.
::::

To create the *Third Party Checks* journal, click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and configure the
following:

- Type [Third Party Checks]{.title-ref} as the
  `Journal Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- Select `Cash`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
  `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- In the `Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, set
  `Cash Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to [1.1.1.02.010
  Cheques de Terceros]{.title-ref}, input a
  `Short Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of your choice, and
  select a `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

![Automatically created cash account.](argentina/auto-cash-account.png){.align-center}

The available payment methods are listed in the *payments* tabs:

- For new incoming third party checks, go to
  `Incoming Payments tab --> Add a line`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"} and select
  `New Third Party Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This
  method is used to create *new* third party checks.
- For incoming and outgoing existing third party checks, go to
  `Incoming Payments tab
  --> Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select
  `Existing Third Party Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  Repeat the same step for the `Outgoing Payments`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} tab. This method is used to receive and/or pay vendor
  bills using already *existing* checks, as well as for internal
  transfers.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can delete pre-existing payment methods appearing by default when
configuring the third party checks journals.
::::

![Payment methods automatically created.](argentina/auto-payment-methods.png){.align-center}

The *Rejected Third Party Checks* journal also needs to be created
and/or configured. This journal is used to manage rejected third party
checks and can be utilized to send checks rejected at the moment of
collection or when coming from vendors when rejected.

To create the *Rejected Third Party Checks* journal, click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and configure the
following:

- Type [Rejected Third Party Checks]{.title-ref} as the
  `Journal Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- Select `Cash`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
  `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- In the `Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, set
  `Cash Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to [1.1.1.01.002
  Rejected Third Party Checks]{.title-ref}, input a
  `Short Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of your choice, and
  select a `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

Use the same payment methods as the *Third Party Checks* journal.

##### New third party checks

To register a *new* third party check for a customer invoice, click the
`Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. In the
pop-up window, you must select `Third Party Checks`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} as journal for the payment registration.

Select `New Third Party Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and fill in the
`Check Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Payment Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Check Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Optionally, you can
manually add the `Check Issuer Vat`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
but this is automatically filled by the customer\'s VAT number related
to the invoice.

![Payment pop-up window with New Third Party Check options enabled.](argentina/third-party-payment-popup.png){.align-center}

##### Existing third party checks

To pay a vendor bill with an *existing* check, click the
`Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. In the
pop-up window, you must select `Third Party Checks`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} as journal for the payment registration.

Select `Existing Third Party Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
as `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select a
check from the `Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. The
field shows all **available existing checks** to be used as payment for
vendor bills.

![Payment pop-up window with Existing Third Party Check options enabled.](argentina/existing-third-party-popup.png){.align-center}

When an **existing third party check** is used, you can review the
operations related to it. For example, you can see if a third party
check made to pay a customer invoice was later used as an existing third
party check to pay a vendor bill.

To do so, either go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Third Party Checks`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} or
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Own Checks`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} depending on the case, and click on a check. In
the `Check Current Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
click on `=> Check Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
bring up the check\'s history and movements.

![Check Operations menu.](argentina/check-operations-menulist.png){.align-center}

The menu also displays critical information related to these operations,
such as:

- The `Payment Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, allowing to
  classify whether it is a payment *sent* to a vendor or a payment
  *received* from a customer
- The `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in which the check is
  currently registered
- The **partner** associated with the operation (either customer or
  vendor).

### Ecommerce electronic invoicing {#argentina/ecommerce-electronic-invoicing}

`Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
*Argentinian eCommerce* ([l10n_ar_website_sale]{.title-ref}) module to
enable the following features and configurations:

- Clients being able to create online accounts for eCommerce purposes.
- Support for required fiscal fields in the eCommerce application.
- Receive payments for sale orders online.
- Generate electronic documents from the eCommerce application.

#### Configuration

Once all of the configurations are made for the Argentinian
`electronic invoice
<argentina/configure-your-company>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} flow,
it is also necessary to complete certain configurations to integrate the
eCommerce flow.

##### Client account registration

To configure your website for client accounts, follow the instructions
in the `checkout
<../../websites/ecommerce/checkout>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation.

##### Automatic invoice

Configure your website to generate electronic documents in the sales
process by navigating to
`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and activating the `Automatic
Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature in the
`Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section to automatically
generate the required electronic documents when the online payment is
confirmed.

![Feature activated to invoice automatically.](argentina/l10nar-automatic-invoicing-ecommerce.png){.align-center}

Since an online payment needs to be confirmed for the
`Automatic Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature to
generate the document, a
`payment provider <../payment_providers>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
**must** be configured for the related website.

##### Products

To allow your products to be invoiced when an online payment is
confirmed, navigate to the desired product from
`Website --> eCommerce --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. In the `General
Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, set the
`Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Ordered quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and define the
desired `Customer Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

#### Invoicing flow for eCommerce

Once the configurations mentioned above are all set, clients can
complete the following required steps in the *Argentinian eCommerce*
flow to input fiscal fields in the checkout process.

Fiscal fields are available for input in the checkout process once the
`Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set as
[Argentina]{.title-ref}. Inputting the fiscal data enables the purchase
to conclude in the corresponding electronic document.

![Fiscal required fields for electronic invoicing.](argentina/l10nar-fiscal-fields-ar-ecommerce.png){.align-center}

When the client makes a successful purchase and payment, the necessary
invoice is generated with the corresponding layout and fiscal stamps
stated in the `Invoice printed report
<argentina/invoice-printed-report>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

::: seealso
`Client account creation <../../websites/ecommerce/checkout>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}

### Liquidity product direct sales

Liquidity product direct sales are used for sales involving third
parties. For such sales, the seller and the proprietary company of the
goods can each register their corresponding sales and purchases.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
*Argentinian Electronic Invoicing* module ([l10n_ar_edi]{.title-ref}) to
use this feature.
::::

#### Configuration

##### Purchase journal

A purchase journal is needed to generate an electronic vendor bill with
a document type *Liquidity Product*. This journal needs to be
synchronized with the AFIP as it will be used to generate the liquidity
product electronic document.

To modify the existing purchase journal or create a new one, navigate to
`Accounting
--> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Then, select the existing purchase journal or click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and fill in the
following required information:

- `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Use Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: check this field
  to to be able select the electronic document type.
- `Is AFIP POS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: check this field to
  be able to generate electronic documents.
- `AFIP POS System`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Electronic Invoice - Web Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  from the drop-down menu in order to send the electronic document to
  AFIP via web service.
- `AFIP POS Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: is the number
  configured in the AFIP to identify the operations related to this AFIP
  POS.
- `AFIP POS Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: is the field
  related to the commercial address registered for the POS, which is
  usually the same address as the company. For example, if a company has
  multiple stores (fiscal locations) then the AFIP will require the
  company to have one AFIP POS per location. This location will be
  printed in the invoice report.

![l10n_ar Purchase Journal Configuration.](argentina/l10n-ar-purchase-journal.png){.align-center}

##### Sales journal

A sales journal is needed to register the invoice when a product is sold
to a third party that will then sell the same product. This journal will
not be synced with AFIP as the invoice will not be electronic.

To modify the existing sales journal or create a new one, navigate to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, selecting the sales journal or click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and fill in the
following required information:

- `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Use Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: check this field
  on the journal to select the electronic document type (in this case
  the electronic invoice).

![l10n_ar Sales Journal Configuration.](argentina/l10n-ar-sales-journal.png){.align-center}

#### Invoicing flow

Once the configurations are all set, the *Liquidity Product Vendor Bill*
will be generated by the company that is selling the product on behalf
of another party. For example, a distributor of a specific product.

## Reports

As part of the localization installation, financial reporting for
Argentina is available in the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard. To access these reports, navigate to
`Accounting
--> Reporting --> Argentinean Statements`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

To access the VAT book report, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click the `fa-book`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} (`book`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), and select
`Argentinean VAT book (AR)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Accounting {#australia/accounting}

### Taxes and GST

In Australia, the standard **Goods and Services Tax (GST)** rate is 10%,
but different rates and exemptions exist for specific categories of
goods and services.

![Default GST rates](australia/default-taxes.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The taxes impact the `BAS report <australia/bas>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

#### Tax mapping

Within the Australian localization, tax names encompass the tax rate as
an integral part of their naming convention. Despite the high number of
`taxes <../accounting/taxes>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} configured
in Odoo, their rates are often similar (0% or 10%).

##### GST sales taxes

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### Variants

Businesses from certain industries need to report payments made to
subcontractors from relevant services during the financial year. Odoo
combines the use of taxes and fiscal positions to report these payments
on the `TPAR <australia/tpar>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. In order
to be compliant with the TPAR\'s obligations, two variants of the main
purchase taxes are available in Odoo, but they are inactive by default.

::: example
For the *10% GST* tax, the variants are:

+-------------+---------------------------+-------------+-------------+
| Tax name    | Description               | Reports     | Default     |
|             |                           | impacted    | status      |
+=============+===========================+=============+=============+
| 10% GST     | Default 10% GST tax       | BAS         | Active      |

+-------------+---------------------------+-------------+-------------+
:::

#### Deferred GST

Odoo allows companies under the [Deferred Goods and Services Tax (DGST)
scheme](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/gst-excise-and-indirect-taxes/gst/in-detail/rules-for-specific-transactions/international-transactions/deferred-gst?=redirected_deferredGSTscheme)
to automate their deferred GST flows.

##### Configuration

It is recommended to:

- go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"} and set the `Tax Return
  Periodicity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
  `monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (= monthly BAS); and
- create a new journal to store all deferred GST entries by going to
  `Accounting
  --> Configuration --> Journals --> New`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}, and selecting `Miscellaneous`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} as its `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} when
  configuring it.

By default, a tax (*100% DGST*, inactive by default) and an account
(*21340 Deferred GST Liability*) are available for Australian companies.
Activate the tax by going to `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Search
for the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} [100%
DGST]{.title-ref} (remove the default filter if necessary), and click
the `Activate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} toggle switch.

##### Flow

###### 1. Importing goods: purchase order and vendor bill

When importing goods from abroad, the GST liability can now be deferred
for companies under the DGST scheme. On the purchase order, select the
`0% TPS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tax (tax paid separately)
for the relevant order lines.

![Setting the 0% TPS tax on a purchase order](australia/dgst-po-tax.png)

###### 2. Recording the DGST balance on the BAS report

When the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is advised electronically of
the aggregated liability for the company by the Integrated Cargo System
(ICS), the GST balance deferred during the previous month becomes
available on the ATO\'s BAS portal.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo does not yet fetch the DGST balance automatically from the ATO. A
manual entry with the liability amount needs to be created in Odoo. We
recommend using a new journal for this purpose since deferrals will be
recurring.
::::

Go to `Accounting --> Journal Entries --> New`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. On the first journal item line, add the
`Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} [21340 Deferred GST
Liability]{.title-ref} and the deferred GST balance as a
`Credit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To resume the example shown
above, we credit \$2,000 and save.

![Creating a journal entry with the DGST account](australia/dgst-balance-credit.png)

An auto-balancing line is created, along with journal items correctly
assigning the right values in the BAS `Tax Grids`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Sections *G11*, *G18*, *7A*, and *ONLY* are updated
correctly.

![The journal entry with the auto-balancing line and BAS tax grids](australia/dgst-tax-grids.png)

After posting the journal entry, the BAS report displays the correct
values for each section, along with the DGST offset.

### Reports

#### Business Activity Statement (BAS) {#australia/bas}

The **BAS report** is a critical tax reporting requirement for
businesses registered for GST in Australia. The BAS is used to report
and remit various taxes to the ATO. With the Odoo BAS feature,
businesses can report on the following:

- GST
- PAYG tax withheld
- DGST

Access the report from the Accounting dashboard by clicking
`BAS Report (AU)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under the
`Miscellaneous Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

![BAS report example](australia/bas-report.png)

The base and tax amounts are collected from the **tax grid**, which is
pre-configured in the system. The tax grid can also be manually set up
for any additional special use-case of GST (e.g., wine equalization
tax). Once the tax for each account is set up, the system automatically
slots journal items into the correct tax category. This ensures the BAS
report is accurate and reflective of the business\'s financial
activities.

![GST grids example](australia/gst-grids.png)

Besides the GST sections, the BAS report also includes the **PAYG** tax
withheld components (*W1* to *W5*, then *summary, section 4*). This
integration ensures that all payroll-related withholding taxes are
accurately captured and reflected within the report.

![PAYG tax withheld and summary of BAS report example](australia/payg.png)

The module incorporates built-in rules that facilitate the automatic
calculation of taxes for types W1 to W5. For a detailed walkthrough and
more information on the calculation process for these taxes, refer to
the `Payroll section <payroll/l10n_au/payroll>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

##### Closing

When it is time to file the tax return with the ATO, click
`Closing Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The tax return
period can be configured under
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Tax
Return Periodicity`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. The start
date of the tax return period can also be defined on the report itself
through the period button (`fa-calendar`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
*period* *year*).

::: seealso
`Year-end closing <../accounting/reporting/year_end>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Odoo uses calendar quarters rather than the Australian FY quarters,
which means *July to September* is *Q3* in Odoo.
::::

Before closing the entry for the first time, the default **GST payable
account** and **GST receivable account** need to be set. A notification
pops up and redirects the user to the tax groups configuration.

![BAS report tax groups](australia/bas-accounts.png)

Once the GST payable and GST receivable accounts are set up, the BAS
report generates an accurate journal closing entry automatically, which
balances out the GST balance with the GST clearing account.

The balance between GST receivable and payable is set against the tax
clearing account defined on the tax group. The amount to be paid to or
received from the ATO can be reconciled against a bank statement.

![BAS report tax payment](australia/bas-taxes.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The BAS report is not directly submitted to the ATO. Odoo helps you
automatically compute the necessary values in each section, with the
possibility to audit them to better understand the history behind these
numbers. Businesses can copy these values and enter them on the [ATO
portal](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/preparing-lodging-and-paying/business-activity-statements-bas/how-to-lodge-your-bas).
::::

#### Taxable Payments Annual Report (TPAR) {#australia/tpar}

Odoo allows businesses to report payments made to contractors or
subcontractors during the financial year. This is done by generating a
**TPAR**. If you are unsure your business needs this report, refer to
the [ATO\'s TPAR web
page](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/preparing-lodging-and-paying/reports-and-returns/taxable-payments-annual-report).

Access the TPAR in Odoo by going to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Taxable Payments
Annual Reports (TPAR)`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

##### Configuration

First, it is required to assign fiscal positions to your contractors
before billing them to update the TPAR. To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Vendors`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select a contractor, and set a
`Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under the
`Sales & Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![TPAR fiscal position on a vendor](australia/tpar-fiscal-positions.png)

Based on the chosen fiscal position, the correct tax mapping will apply
to the contractor\'s vendor bills.

![TPAR vendor bill tax mapping](australia/tpar-vendor-bill-tax.png)

The TPAR includes the following information from contractors:

- `ABN`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Total GST`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (the total tax paid)
- `Gross Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (the amounts are
  displayed after a vendor bill has been marked as paid)
- `Tax Withheld`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (displayed if the
  contractor is registered with a fiscal position set to
  `TPAR without ABN`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"})

The TPAR can be exported to multiple formats: PDF, XLSX, and TPAR.

### Remittance advice {#australia/remittance}

A remittance advice is a document used as proof of payment to a
business. In Odoo, it can be accessed by going to
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, selecting the payment(s), and clicking
`Print --> Payment Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

![Remittance advice example](australia/remittance.png)

### E-invoicing {#australia/peppol}

#### Peppol

Odoo is compliant with Australia\'s [Peppol
requirements](https://peppol.org/learn-more/country-profiles/australia/).
Set up your customers and vendors by going to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Customers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} or `Vendors -->
Vendors`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, selecting one,
clicking the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and
configuring the `Electronic Invoicing`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section as needed.

![Electronic invoicing settings for a partner](australia/partner-einvoicing.png)

:::: important

Validating an invoice or credit note for a partner on the Peppol network
will download a compliant XML file that can be manually uploaded to your
Peppol network. Odoo is currently in the process of becoming an access
point for the ANZ region.

### ABA files for batch payments {#australia/aba}

An ABA file is a digital format developed by the [Australian Banking
Association](https://www.ausbanking.org.au/). It is designed for
business customers to facilitate bulk payment processing by uploading a
single file from their business management software.

The main advantage of using ABA files is to improve payment and matching
efficiency. This is achieved by consolidating numerous payments into one
file for batch processing, which can be submitted to all Australian
banks.

#### Configuration

##### Batch payments

Go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and enable `Batch
Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

##### Bank journal

Go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the `Bank`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} journal. Enter the `Account Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, click `Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and fill in the following fields:

- `Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `BSB`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Account Holder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

Then, toggle on the `Send Money`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
switch and click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Using the `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
optional.
::::

Back on the `Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
fill in the following fields under the `ABA`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section:

- `BSB`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the BSB code from the bank
  account is used to fill in this field.

- `Financial Institution Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  official 3-letter abbreviation of the bank (e.g., [WBC]{.title-ref}
  for Westpac)

- `Supplying User Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: 6-digit
  number provided by the bank. Contact your bank or check its website if
  you do not know it.

- `APCA Identification Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  6-digit number provided by the bank. Contact your bank or check its
  website if you do not know it.

- 

  `Include Self Balancing Transaction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: selecting this option adds an additional

  :   \"self-balancing\" transaction to the end of the ABA file, which
      is required by some banks.

##### Customers\' and vendors\' bank accounts

Go to `Accounting --> Customers --> Customers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} or `Accounting -->
Vendors --> Vendors`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select
a customer or vendor. Open the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and, under the `Bank Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to fill in their:

- `Account Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `BSB`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Account Holder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

Then, toggle on the `Send Money`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
switch and click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

#### Generating an ABA file

To generate an ABA file, create a vendor bill, confirm it, and ensure
the vendor\'s banking information is set up correctly.

Next, click `Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the vendor bill,
and select, for the following fields:

- `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: `Bank`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `ABA Credit Transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Recipient Bank Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
  vendor\'s account number

Once payments are created, go to
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select the payments to be included in the batch,
and click `Create Batch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Verify all
information is correct and click `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Once validated, the ABA file is available in the
**chatter** on the right.

After uploading the file to your bank\'s portal, an ABA transaction line
will appear in your bank feed at the following bank feed iteration. You
will need to reconcile it against the **batch payment** made in Odoo.

## SAF-T (Standard Audit File for Tax) {#localizations/austria/saf-t}

The Austrian tax office may request a SAF-T. The Austrian SAF-T Export
module allows exporting the report in XML format.

### Configuration {#localizations/austria/saf-t-configuration}

This section explains how to configure the database to ensure all the
information required by the SAF-T is available. If anything is missing,
a warning message listing which information is needed will be displayed
during the export.

#### Company information {#localizations/austria/saf-t-company}

Open the database `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Under
the `Companies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, click
`Update Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and ensure the
following fields are correctly filled in:

- `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, by providing at least
  the following information:
  - `Street`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Company ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} by providing your
  company\'s tax ID
- `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} by providing, if you have
  one, your `UID-Nummer
  (Umsatzsteueridentifikationsnummer)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  (including the country prefix)

##### Contact person {#localizations/austria/saf-t-contact}

At least one **contact person** must be linked to your company in the
`Contacts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app, and:

> - Ensure the contact type is set to `Individual`{.interpreted-text
>   role="guilabel"}.
> - Select your company in the `Company name`{.interpreted-text
>   role="guilabel"} field.
> - Provide at least one phone number using the
>   `Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
>   `Mobile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

#### Customer and supplier information {#localizations/austria/saf-t-customer-supplier-information}

Using the `Contacts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app, fill in the
`Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of any partner that appears
in your invoices, vendor bills, or payments.

For partners that are companies, fill in the VAT number (including the
country prefix) in the `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

#### Accounting settings {#localizations/austria/saf-t-accounting}

Go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Under the `Austrian
localization`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, fill in the
following fields:

- `ÖNACE-Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Profit Assessment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

::: seealso
[ÖNACE information on the Austrian Economic Chambers
website](https://www.wko.at/service/zahlen-daten-fakten/oenace.html)
:::

#### Chart of accounts mapping {#localizations/austria/saf-t-chart-of-account}

The Austrian SAF-T specifications define a chart of accounts (COA). All
relevant accounts for the SAF-T export must be annotated with a fitting
account from this COA.

The needed mapping information is supplied by adding tags to the
accounts. For example, adding the [1000]{.title-ref} tag to an account
maps it (virtually) to the SAF-T COA account with the code
[1000]{.title-ref}. Any number can be used as long as there is an
account in the SAF-T COA with that code.

The `Austria - Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} module
adds a tag for each SAF-T COA account. Furthermore, it automatically
maps many accounts from the default Austrian COA.

You can try exporting the SAF-T report to check if there are unmapped
accounts (or mapped to multiple SAF-T accounts). A warning will be
displayed if there is any issue with your configuration or the mapping.
Clicking `View Problematic Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
lets you view them.

`Chart of accounts documentation <../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}

### Exporting the SAF-T report {#localizations/austria/saf-t-exporting}

To export the SAF-T report, go to
`Accounting --> Reports --> General Ledger`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click the right side of the
`PDF`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and select
`SAF-T`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The SAF-T button to export the file in XML format](austria/austria-saft-button.png)

## Point of Sale {#localizations/austria/pos}

### RKSV (Registrierkassensicherheitsverordnung) {#localizations/austria/pos-rksv}

The `RKSV (Registrierkassensicherheitsverordnung)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is an Austrian regulation designed to secure cash registers
and prevent tax fraud. It requires businesses to use tamper-proof
electronic cash register systems, including
`point of sale </applications/sales/point_of_sale>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} systems.

These systems must be equipped with a **Signature Creation Unit (SCU)**,
which is responsible for signing each transaction. This ensures that the
transaction data cannot be altered. Additionally, the regulation
mandates periodic transaction data exports for audit purposes. Odoo
provides a compliant solution through [fiskaly](https://fiskaly.com), a
*cloud-based solution*.

#### Configuration {#localizations/austria/pos-rksv-configuration}

`Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
**Austria - Security Regulation for Point of Sale**
([l10n_at_pos]{.title-ref}) module.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If this module is not listed,
`update the app list <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

##### Company information {#localizations/austria/pos-rksv-company}

Open the Settings app, navigate to the `Companies`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, and click `oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Update Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to make
sure the `information
<localizations/austria/saf-t-company>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is
up-to-date and correctly filled in.

To link your company to Fiskaly and use it in Odoo, open the
`Fiskaly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and enable
`Managed by Odoo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-toggle-on`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}, which activates automatic
integration management.

If a Fiskaly account already exists with its own credentials, disable
the toggle and configure the existing
`Fiskaly credentials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} manually.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

For testing, ensure that `Test Fiskaly`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} `fa-toggle-on`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} is
enabled to run the integration without impacting the production server.
Since test mode is enabled by default, disable
`Test Fiskaly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-toggle-off`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} to switch to production
mode.

![Management toggle](austria/management-toggle.png)

Once the credentials have been authenticated, the Fiskaly management
option (by Odoo or custom) and the mode (test or production) can no
longer be modified.
::::

Click `Generate Credentials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
create a new organization in the Fiskaly system and generate the
necessary credentials to run the service. Next, click
`Authenticate Keys`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to validate those
credentials.

##### Link a Fiskaly organization to FinanzOnline {#localizations/austria/pos-fiskaly-finanzonline}

To link the Fiskaly organization with the Austrian Ministry of Finance,
FinanzOnline credentials must be provided. To do so, fill in the
following information in your company\'s `Fiskaly`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab:

- `Participant Identifier`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `User Identifier`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `User Pin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

:::: note

Click `Authenticate FON`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to link your
Fiskaly organization to the Austrian Ministry of Finance and start
regular
`point of sale </applications/sales/point_of_sale>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} operations.

#### Digitally signatured receipts {#localizations/austria/pos-digitally-sign-receipts}

To ensure the integrity and authenticity of the receipts, the system
automatically signs them using the
`SCU (Signature Creation Unit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in a
background process. The receipt then displays an encrypted signature as
a QR code containing the receipt number and information about the SCU
used to sign it.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- If the `SCU (Signature Creation Unit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
is unavailable, receipts may not include a QR code; in such cases:

- Make sure the receipt includes a
  `Sicherheitseinrichtung ausgefallen`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} message, indicating that the system is linked to
  Fiskaly services, but the SCU is temporarily unavailable.
- If this message is missing from the receipt, it indicates no
  connection to Fiskaly services.

\- Orders that remain unsigned due to SCU unavailability can be signed
manually. To do so, follow these steps:

1.  Go to `Point of Sale --> Orders --> Orders`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
2.  To identify unsigned orders, click the
    `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(adjust
    settings)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
    `Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list view to reveal the
    `Receipt
    Signed?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.
3.  Select the unsigned orders, click `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text
    role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
    select `Sign Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

#### DEP7 export {#localizations/austria/pos-dep7}

The exported
`DEP7 (Digitale Schnittstelle der Finanzverwaltung für Kassensysteme)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} file allows authorities to verify transactions and ensure
compliance with anti-fraud measures. Businesses must periodically
generate it for audit purposes and submit it to the Austrian tax
authorities upon request.

To generate it, go to
`Point of Sale --> Reporting --> DEP7 Reports`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and, in the `DEP7 Reports`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, fill in the following mandatory fields:

- `Start Datetime`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Exports data with
  dates on or after the start date.
- `End Datetime`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Exports data with
  dates on or before the end date.
- `Point of Sale`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Specify from which
  point of sale(s) data must be exported.

Then, click `Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to download the
PDF file with DEP7 data.

![DEP7 Reports](austria/dep7-reports.png)

#### Monthly / Yearly closing receipts {#localizations/austria/pos-montly-yearly-receipts}

To print monthly/yearly closing receipts,
`start a session <pos/session-start>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} from
the **POS dashboard** and click `Open Register`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the related point of sale. Click the
`oi-view-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(list view)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the top-right
corner and select `Montly/Yearly Receipts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

The last month is selected by default in the
`Print closing receipts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window. To
change it, select `Monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Yearly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then click the
`fa-calendar-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(calendar)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to select the
desired month/year.

## Taxes {#belgium/taxes}

Default Belgian taxes are created automatically when the
`Belgium - Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
`Belgium - Accounting Reports`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
modules are installed. Each tax impacts the Belgian
`Tax Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, available by going to
`Accounting --> Reporting -->
Statements Reports: Tax Report`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

In Belgium, the standard VAT rate is **21%**, but there are lower rates
for some categories of goods and services. An intermediate rate of
**12%** is applied on social housing and food served in restaurants,
while a reduced rate of **6%** applies to most basic goods, such as
food, water supply, books, and medicine. A **0%** rate applies to some
exceptional goods and services, such as some daily and weekly
publications, as well as recycled goods.

### Non-deductible taxes {#belgium/non-deductible}

In Belgium, some taxes are not fully deductible, such as taxes on the
maintenance of cars. This means a part of these taxes is considered as
an expense.

In Odoo, you can configure non-deductible taxes by creating tax rules
for these taxes and linking them to the corresponding accounts. This
way, the system automatically calculates the taxes and allocates them to
the appropriate accounts.

To configure a new non-deductible tax, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Accounting: Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:

1.  `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select
    `Base`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
    `Based On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column;
2.  `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then select
    `on tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
    `Based on`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column and enter the
    **non-deductible** percentage in the `%`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} column;
3.  On the `of tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line, select the
    `Tax Grid(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} related to your
    tax;
4.  `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with the
    **deductible** percentage in the `%`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} column;
5.  Set `of tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
    `Based On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
6.  Select `411000 VAT recoverable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    as account, and select the related tax grid.

Once you have created a non-deductible tax, you can apply it to your
transactions by selecting the appropriate tax during the encoding of
bills and credit notes. The system automatically calculates the tax
amount and allocates it to the corresponding accounts based on the tax
rules configured.

::: example
With the Belgian localization, the **21% car** tax is created by default
(50% non-deductible).

## Reports {#belgium/reports}

Here is the list of Belgian-specific reports available:

- Balance sheet;
- Profit & loss;
- Tax report;
- Partner VAT Listing;
- EC Sales List;
- Intrastat.

You can access Belgian-specific versions of reports by clicking on the
**book** icon when on a report and selecting its Belgian version:
**(BE)**.

### Disallowed expenses report {#belgium/disallowed-expenses}

**Disallowed expenses** are expenses that can be deducted from your
accounting result but not from your fiscal result.

The **disallowed expenses report** is available by going to
`Accounting --> Reporting
--> Management: Disallowed Expenses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. It allows financial results in real-time, and
periodic changes. This report is generated based on the **disallowed
expenses categories** that you can reach by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Management: Disallowed Expenses
Categories`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Some categories
already exist by default but do not have any rates. Click on
`Set Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to update a specific
category.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- You can add multiple rates for various dates. In that case, the rate
used to calculate the expense depends on the date at which it is
calculated, and the rate set for that date. - If you have the **Fleet**
app installed, tick the `Car Category`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} box when applicable. This makes the vehicle mandatory
while booking a vendor bill.
::::

To link a disallowed expenses category with a specific account, go to
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Accounting: Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Find the account you want, and click on
`Setup`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Add the
`Disallowed Expense category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Disallowed
Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. From now, when an
expense is created with this account, the disallowed expense is
calculated based on the rate mentioned in the
`Disallowed Expense category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Let\'s take an example reflecting **restaurant** and **car expenses**.

#### Restaurant expenses {#belgium/restaurant-expenses}

In Belgium, 69% of **restaurant** expenses are deductible. Create a new
**disallowed expenses category** and set both
`Related Account(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Current Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

#### Car expenses: vehicle split {#belgium/vehicle-split}

In Belgium, the deductible percentage varies from car to car and,
therefore, should be indicated for each vehicle. To do so, open
`Fleet`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select a vehicle. In
the `Tax
info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, go to the
`Deductibility Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section and
click on `Add a
line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Add a
`Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a
`%`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The amounts go in the same
account for all car expenses.

When you create a bill for car expenses, you can link each expense to a
specific car by filling the `Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column, so the right percentage is applied.

![Disallowed expenses categories](belgium/car-bill.png)

The `vehicle split`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option available
in the disallowed expenses report allows you to see the rate and
disallowed amount for each car.

![Disallowed expenses categories](belgium/vehicle-split.png)

## Fee form 281.50 and form 325 {#belgium/forms}

### Fee form 281.50 {#belgium/281.50}

Annually, a **281.50 fee form** must be reported to the fiscal
authorities. To do so, the tag [281.50]{.title-ref} must be added on the
**contact form** of the entities concerned by the **281.50** fee. To add
the tag, open `Contacts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select
the person or company you want to create a **281.50 fee form** for, and
add the [281.50]{.title-ref} tag in the `Tags`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

![add the tag 281.50 on a contact form](belgium/281-50.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Make sure the **street, zip code, country**, and **VAT number** are also
informed on the **Contact form**.
::::

Then, depending on the nature of the expense, add the corresponding
[281.50]{.title-ref} tag on the impact accounts. To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Accounting: Chart of
Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click on
`Setup`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add the corresponding
[281.50]{.title-ref} tag on the impacted accounts, i.e.,
`281.50 - Commissions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, depending on
the nature of the expense.

### Form 325 {#belgium/325}

You can create a **325 form** by going to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Belgium:
Create 325 form`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. A new page
pops up: select the right options and click `Generate 325
form`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To open an already generated
**325 form**, go to `Accounting --> Reporting -->
Belgium: Open 325 forms`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

![Add the tag 281-50 on a contact form](belgium/325-form.png)

## CODA and SODA statements {#belgium/coda-soda}

related to salaries. SODA files can be imported into the journal you use
to record salaries by going to your Accounting **dashboard** and
clicking `Upload`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the related
journal card form.

Once your **SODA** files are imported, the entries are created
automatically in your salary journal.

![Import SODA files](belgium/soda-import.png)

### CodaBox {#belgium/einvoicing}

**CodaBox** is a service that allows Belgian companies and accounting
firms to access bank information and statements. Odoo provides a way to
import such statements automatically.

## Electronic invoicing with Peppol {#belgium/peppol}

As of 1 January 2026, all Belgian companies must be registered on the
Peppol network to send and receive electronic invoices.

To activate Peppol, refer to the
`Peppol documentation <accounting/e-invoicing/peppol>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, ensuring during
`registration <accounting/e-invoicing/peppol-registration>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} that:

- The `Peppol EAS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set to
  `0208 - Numero d'entreprise /
  ondernemingsnummer / Unternehmensnummer`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- the `Peppol Endpoint`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set
  to the company registry number.

In addition, when veryfing that a customer is
`registered as a Peppol participant
<accounting/e-invoicing/contact-verification>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, ensure the `Format`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field is set to `BIS Billing 3.0`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
`Peppol documentation <accounting/e-invoicing/peppol>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
:::

## Cash discount {#belgium/cash-discount}

In Belgium, if an early payment discount is offered on an invoice, the
tax is calculated based on the discounted total amount, whether the
customer benefits from the discount or not.

To apply the right tax amount and report it correctly in your VAT
return, set the tax reduction as
`Always (upon invoice)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
`../accounting/customer_invoices/cash_discounts`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Fiscal certification: POS restaurant {#belgium/pos-restaurant-certification}

In Belgium, the owner of a cooking business such as a restaurant or food
truck is required by law to use a government-certified **Cash Register
System** for their receipts. This applies if their yearly earnings
(excluding VAT, drinks, and take-away food) exceed 25,000 euros.

This government-certified system entails the use of a
`certified POS system
<belgium/certified-pos>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, along with a
device called a `Fiscal Data Module <belgium/fdm>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (or **black box**) and a
`VAT Signing Card <belgium/vat>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Do not forget to register as *foodservice industry manager* on the
[Federal Public Service Finance registration
form](https://www.systemedecaisseenregistreuse.be/fr/enregistrement).
::::

### Certified POS system {#belgium/certified-pos}

The Odoo POS system is certified for databases hosted on **Odoo
Online**, **Odoo.sh**, and **On-Premise**.

::: seealso
`/administration/standard_extended_support`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

A [certified POS
system](https://www.systemedecaisseenregistreuse.be/systemes-certifies)
must adhere to rigorous government regulations, which means it operates
differently from a non-certified POS.

- On a certified POS, you cannot:
  - Set up and use the **global discounts** feature (the
    [pos_discount]{.title-ref} module is blacklisted and cannot be
    activated).
  - Set up and use the **loyalty programs** feature (the
    [pos_loyalty]{.title-ref} module is blacklisted and cannot be
    activated).
  - Reprint receipts (the [pos_reprint]{.title-ref} module is
    blacklisted and cannot be activated).
  - Modify prices in order lines.
  - Modify or delete order lines in POS orders.
  - Sell products without a valid VAT number.
  - Use a POS that is not connected to an IoT box.
- The
  `cash rounding <../../sales/point_of_sale/pricing/cash_rounding>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} feature must be activated and set to a
  `Rounding Precision`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of
  [0,05]{.title-ref} and a `Rounding Method`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} set as `Half-Up`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- Taxes must be set as included in the price. To set it up, go to
  `Point of Sale -->
  Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
  and from the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
  open the `Default Sales Tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form
  by clicking the arrow next to the default sales tax field. There,
  click `Advanced Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and enable
  `Included in Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- At the start of a POS session, users must click
  `Work in`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to clock in. Doing so
  allows the registration of POS orders. If users are not clocked in,
  they cannot make POS orders. Likewise, they must click
  `Work Out`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to clock out at the end
  of the session.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

If you configure a POS to work with a
`FDM (Fiscal Data Module)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, you cannot
use it again without it.
::::

### Fiscal Data Module (FDM) {#belgium/fdm}

An FDM, or **black box**, is a government-certified device that works
together with the Point of Sale application and saves your POS orders
information. Concretely, a **hash** (`unique code`{.interpreted-text
role="dfn"}) is generated for each POS order and added to its receipt.
This allows the government to verify that all revenue is declared.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Only the FDM from **Boîtenoire.be** with the [FDM certificate number
BMC04](https://www.systemedecaisseenregistreuse.be/fr/systemes-certifies#FDM%20certifiés)
is supported by Odoo. [Contact the manufacturer (GCV
BMC)](https://www.boîtenoire.be/contact) to order one.
::::

#### Configuration

Before setting up your database to work with an FDM, ensure you have the
following hardware:

- a **Boîtenoire.be** (certificate number BMC04) FDM;
- an RS-232 serial null modem cable per FDM;
- an RS-232 serial-to-USB adapter per FDM;
- an `IoT Box <belgium/iotbox>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} (one IoT
  box per FDM); and
- a receipt printer.

##### Black box module {#belgium/blackbox}

As a pre-requisite, `activate <general/install>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} the [Belgian Registered Cash Register]{.title-ref} module
(technical name: [pos_blackbox_be]{.title-ref}).

![black box modules for belgian fiscal certification](belgium/be-modules.png)

Once the module is activated, add your VAT number to your company
information. To set it up, go to
`Settings --> Companies --> Update Info`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and fill in the `VAT`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. Then, enter a national registration number for
every staff member who operates the POS system. To do so, go to the
`Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app and open an employee
form. There, go to `HR
settings tab --> Attendance/Point of Sale`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and fill in the
`INSZ or BIS number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![ISNZ or BIS number field on employee form](belgium/bis-number.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To input your information, click on your avatar, go to
`My Profile --> Preference
tab`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and enter your INSZ or BIS
number in the designated field.
::::

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

You must configure the `FDM (Fiscal Data Module)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} directly in the production database. Utilizing it in a
testing environment may result in incorrect data being stored within the
FDM.
::::

##### IoT Box {#belgium/iotbox}

In order to use an `FDM (Fiscal Data Module)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, you need a registered IoT Box. To register your IoT box,
you must contact us through our [support contact
form](https://www.odoo.com/help) and provide the following information:

- your VAT number;
- your company\'s name, address, and legal structure;
- the identifier of your IoT Box.

Once your IoT box is certified,
`connect <../../general/iot/connect>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} it
to your database. To verify that the IoT Box recognizes the FDM, go to
the IoT homepage and scroll down the `IOT Device`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, which should display the FDM.

![Hardware status page on a registered IoT Box](belgium/iot-devices.png)

Then, add the IoT to your POS. To do so, go to
`Point of Sale --> Configuration -->
Point of Sale`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select your POS,
scroll down to the `Connected Device`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section, and enable `IoT Box`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Lastly, add the FMD in the `Fiscal Data Module`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To be able to use an FDM, you must at least connect one
`Receipt Printer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

### VAT signing card {#belgium/vat}

When you open a POS session and make your initial transaction, you are
prompted to enter the PIN provided with your
`VSC (VAT signing card)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. The card is
delivered by the `FPS (Service
Public Federal Finances)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} upon
[registration](https://www.systemedecaisseenregistreuse.be/fr/enregistrement).

## Localization overview {#localizations/brazil/loc-review}

The Brazilian localization package ensures compliance with Brazilian
fiscal and accounting regulations. It includes tools for managing taxes,
fiscal positions, reporting, and a predefined chart of accounts tailored
to Brazil's standards.

The Brazilian localization package provides the following key features
to ensure compliance with local fiscal and accounting regulations:

- `Chart of accounts <localizations/brazil/chart-of-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: a predefined structure tailored to Brazilian accounting
  standards
- `Taxes <localizations/brazil/taxes>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:
  pre-configured tax rates, including standard VAT, zero-rated, and
  exempt options.
- `Payroll </applications/hr/payroll>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
- `Reporting <../accounting/reporting>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}

### Chart of accounts {#localizations/brazil/chart-of-accounts}

`chart of accounts <../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, the accounts are mapped automatically to their
corresponding taxes, and the default account payable and account
receivable fields.

The Brazil chart of accounts is based on the SPED CoA, which provides a
baseline of the necessary accounts.

### Taxes {#localizations/brazil/taxes}

`Taxes <../accounting/taxes>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} are
automatically created and configured when installing the Brazilian
localization. Avalara uses some to compute taxes on sales orders or
invoices.

Taxes used for services must be manually added and configured, as the
rate may differ depending on the city where the service is offered.

:::: important

NFS-e can\'t be issued for service taxes created manually. To
`electronically send an NFS-e

Warning
:::

Do not delete taxes, as they are used for the AvaTax tax computation. If
deleted, Odoo creates them again when used in an
`SO (Sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or invoice, computing
taxes with AvaTax. However, the account used to register the tax must be
reconfigured in the tax\'s `Definition`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, under the
`Distribution for invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Distribution for refunds`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sections.

## Company and contacts {#localizations/brazil/company-and-contacts}

To use all the features of this fiscal localization, the following
fields are required on the
`company record </applications/general/companies>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}:

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

([l10n_br_avatax]{.title-ref}) module. - Odoo is a certified partner of
Avalara Brazil. - The
`Avalara AvaTax integration <../accounting/taxes/avatax>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} uses `In-App-Purchases
(IAPs) <../../essentials/in_app_purchase>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
to compute taxes and handle electronic documents (e.g.,
`NF-e <localizations/brazil/e-invoice-goods>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `NFS-e
<localizations/brazil/e-invoice-services>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}). Each action consumes credits from the [IAP credit
balance](https://iap.odoo.com/iap/in-app-services/819). On creation, new
databases receive 500 free credits.
::::

To compute the goods and services tax and process electronic invoices,
the following configurations are needed:

- `Company <localizations/brazil/company-and-contacts>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Contacts <localizations/brazil/company-and-contacts>`{.interpreted-text

When **testing** or **creating a production**
`AvaTax Portal Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} integration in
a sandbox or production database, use a real email address, as it is
needed to `connect to
Avalara <accounting/avatax/prerequisites>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
and set up the certificates, whether to test or use it on production.

There are two different Brazilian Avalara Portals:

- One for testing: <https://portal.sandbox.avalarabrasil.com.br/>
- One for production: <https://portal.avalarabrasil.com.br/>

When the account is created from Odoo, select the right environment.
Moreover, the email used to open the account cannot be used to open
another account. Save the `API ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `API Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} when the account is
created from Odoo.

![Transfer API Credentials.](brazil/transfer-api-credentials.png)
::::

After the account is created from Odoo, go to the Avalara Portal to set
up the password:

1.  Access the [Avalara
    portal](https://portal.avalarabrasil.com.br/Login).
2.  Click `Meu primeiro acesso`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
3.  Add the email address used in Odoo to create the Avalara/AvaTax
    account, and click `Solicitar Senha`{.interpreted-text

If you use AvaTax in Odoo for tax computation **only**, setting a
password or accessing the Avalara portal is unnecessary. However, to use
the electronic invoice service, access to AvaTax is needed, and the
`certificate must be uploaded
<localizations/brazil/certificate-upload>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

#### A1 certificate upload {#localizations/brazil/certificate-upload}

To issue electronic invoices, a certificate must be uploaded to the
[AvaTax portal](https://portal.avalarabrasil.com.br/Login).

The certificate will be synchronized with Odoo as long as the external
identifier number in the AvaTax portal matches, without special
characters, with the CNPJ number, and the identification number (CNPJ)
in Odoo matches the CNPJ in AvaTax.

:::: important

Some cities require the certificate to be linked within the City Portal
system before issuing NFS-e from Odoo.

If an error message from the city that says
`Your certificate is not linked
to the user`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is received, this
process needs to be done in the city portal.

## Accounting {#localizations/brazil/accounting}

### Electronic documents {#localizations/brazil/electronic-documents}

#### Configuration {#localizations/brazil/journals}

A *series* number is linked to a sequence number range for electronic
invoices. To configure the series number on a sales journal, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and set it in the `Series`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. If more than one series is needed, a new sales
journal must be created, and a new series number must be assigned for
each series.

Enable the `Use Documents?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option as
the `Series`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field will only be
displayed if the `Use Documents?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option is selected on the journal.

When issuing electronic and non-electronic invoices, the
`Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field selects the document
type used when creating the invoice.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When creating the journal, ensure the
`Dedicated Credit Note Sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field in the `Accounting Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section is unchecked, as in Brazil, sequences between invoices, credit
notes, and debit notes are shared per series number, which means per
journal.
::::

#### Customer invoices {#localizations/brazil/customer-invoices}

To process an electronic invoice for goods (NF-e) or services (NFS-e),
the invoice must be confirmed and taxes must be computed by Avalara. The
following fields must be filled out:

- `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, with all customer
  information
- `Payment Method: Brazil`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Specify
  the expected payment method.
- `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
  `(55) Electronic Invoice (NF-e)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `(SE)
  Electronic Service Invoice (NFS-e)`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.

`Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:

- `Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set as
  `Automatic Tax Mapping (Avalara Brazil)`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.

Some optional fields depend on the nature of the transaction. These
fields in the `Other
Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab are not required, so in
most cases, leaving them blank will not result in errors from the
government when the invoice is submitted:

- `Freight Model`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} determines how the
  goods are planned to be transported - domestic.
- `Transporter Brazil`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} determines who
  is doing the transportation.

Then, click `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In the
`Print & Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window, click `Process
e-invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and any other options,
such as `Download`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Finally, click
`Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to process the invoice with
the government.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

All fields available on the invoice used to issue an electronic invoice
are also available on the sales order, if needed. When creating the
first invoice, the `Document Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field is displayed and allocated as the first number to be used
sequentially for subsequent invoices.
::::

#### Credit notes {#localizations/brazil/credit-notes}

If a sales return needs to be registered, a
`credit note can be created in Odoo
<accounting/credit_notes/issue-credit-note>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and sent to the government for validation.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Credit notes are only available for electronic invoices for goods
(NF-e).
::::

#### Debit notes {#localizations/brazil/debit-notes}

If additional information needs to be included or values that were not
accurately provided in the original invoice need to be corrected, a
`debit note can be issued
<accounting/credit_notes/issue-debit-note>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Debit notes are only available for electronic invoices for goods
(NF-e). - Only the products included in the original invoice can be
included in the debit note. While changes can be made to the product\'s
unit price or quantity, products **cannot** be added to the debit note.
The purpose of this document is only to declare the amount to be added
to the original invoice for the same or fewer products.
::::

#### Invoice cancellation {#localizations/brazil/invoice-cancellation}

It is possible to cancel an electronic invoice that the government
validated.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Check whether the electronic invoice is still within the cancellation
deadline, which may vary according to each state\'s legislation.
::::

##### E-invoices for goods (NF-e) {#localizations/brazil/e-invoice-goods-nf-e}

To cancel an e-invoice for goods (NF-e) in Odoo, click
`Request Cancel`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and add a
cancellation `Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the pop-up
that appears. To send this cancellation reason to the customer via
email, enable the `E-mail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This is an electronic cancellation, which means that Odoo will send a
request to the government to cancel the NF-e. It will then consume one
`IAP (In-app-purchase)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} credit, as an
`API (Application programming interface)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
call occurs.
::::

##### E-invoices for services (NFS-e) {#localizations/brazil/e-invoice-services-nf-e}

To cancel an e-invoice for services (NFS-e) in Odoo, click
`Request Cancel`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. There is no
electronic cancellation process in this case, as not every city has this
service available. The user needs to cancel this NFS-e on the city
portal manually. Once that step is completed, they can request the
cancellation in Odoo, which will cancel the invoice.

#### Correction letter {#localizations/brazil/correction-letter}

A correction letter can be created and linked to an electronic invoice
for goods (NF-e) that the government validated.

To do so in Odoo, click `Correction Letter`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and add a correction `Reason`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to the pop-up. To send the correction reason to a
customer via email, enable the `E-mail`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Correction letters are only available for electronic invoices for goods
(NF-e).
::::

#### Invoice number range invalidation {#localizations/brazil/invoice-number-invalidation}

A range of sequences that are assigned to sales journals can be
invalidated by the government if they are not currently used **and**
will not be used in the future. To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, open the journal, click the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} (gear) icon, and select
`Invalidate Number Range (BR)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. On
the `Invalidate Number Range (BR)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
wizard, add the `Initial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`End Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the range that should
be cancelled, and enter an invalidation `Reason`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Invoice number range invalidation is only available for electronic
invoices for goods (NF-e). - The journal\'s chatter records the log of
the cancelled numbers, along with the XML file.
::::

### Vendor bills {#localizations/brazil/vendor-bills}

When receiving an invoice from a supplier, encode the bill in Odoo by
adding all the commercial information and the same Brazilian-specific
information recorded on the `customer invoices
<localizations/brazil/electronic-documents>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

These Brazilian-specific fields are:

- `Payment Method: Brazil`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Specify
  the expected payment method.
- `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: used by the vendor
- `Document Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the invoice
  number from the supplier
- `Freight Model`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: **NF-e specific**
  how goods are planned to be transported - domestic
- `Transporter Brazil`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: **NF-e
  specific** who is doing the transportation.

## Point of sale NFC-e {#localizations/brazil/pos}

The NFC-e is a legal document that supports selling goods or merchandise
to the final customer. Like the
`NF-e <localizations/brazil/e-invoice-goods-nf-e>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, the electronic customer invoice is also issued in XML file
format and has an auxiliary document (DANFC-e) known as the *NFC-e
Summary*. This electronic document can be issued through **Odoo Point of
Sale**.

Its legal validity is guaranteed by the digital signature and by each
Brazilian state\'s SEFAZ (Secretaria da Fazenda).

:::: important

The
`Avalara integration <localizations/brazil/avatax-account>`{.interpreted-text

credit consumption:

- Tax calculation at the time of sale
- Electronic invoice issuance (NFC-e)
::::

:::: note

Go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and scroll to the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section. In the `NFC-e configuration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, complete the following CSC (Taxpayer Security
Code) fields:

- `CSC ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The *CSC ID* or *CSC
  Token* is an identification of the taxpayer security code, which can
  have 1 to 6 digits and is available on the official website of your
  state's Department of Finance (SEFAZ).
- `CSC Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The *CSC Number* is a
  code of up to 36 characters that only you and the Department of
  Finance know. It is used to generate the QR Code of the NFC-e and
  ensure the authenticity of the DANFE.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The information required for these fields can be generated through the
SEFAZ website of each Brazilian State by the company\'s accountant.
::::

### Product configuration {#localizations/brazil/pos-product}

Access the relevant
`product form in POS <../../sales/point_of_sale/configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, then configure the
`product <localizations/brazil/products>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}\'s `Brazil Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
fields.

### Point of sale {#localizations/brazil/pos-shop-configuration}

Go to `Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and make sure that the relevant Point of Sale is
`selected at the top of the screen <../../sales/point_of_sale/configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. Then, scroll to the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section and configure the
`Brazilian EDI`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields:

- `Series`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Next number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the next NFC-e
  number in the sequence to be issued, for instance, if the last number
  issued in SEFAZ is [100]{.title-ref}, the *Next number* will be
  [101]{.title-ref}.

### Workflow {#localizations/brazil/pos-workflow}

#### Generating an NFC-e {#localizations/brazil/generate-nfc-e}

To generate an NFC-e, follow these steps:

1.  `Open the relevant point of sale shop and make a sale <pos/session-start>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
2.  Validate the payment to calculate taxes and issue an NFC-e. The
    valid NFC-e appears on the right side of the screen.

![NFC-e Success in a POS session.](brazil/l10n-br-nfce-succesfully-issued.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It is also possible to issue an NFC-e that identifies the customer by
their CPF/CNPJ. To do so, click `fa-user`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, search for the customer,
or create a new one.

The following are mandatory fields to issue a CPF/CNPJ identified NFC-e:

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} where the invoice is being
  issued
- `CPF/CNPJ`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
::::

1.  Click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The NFC-e
    appears, highlighting the customer\'s CPF on the print.
2.  Click `Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `Send via e-mail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to deliver the
    invoice to the customer.

#### NFC-e ticket print {#localizations/brazil/nfc-e-print}

After
`generating and validating the NFC-e <localizations/brazil/generate-nfc-e>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, click `Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to deliver
the invoice.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The Odoo NFC-e feature is compatible with any thermal printer and does
not require an `Odoo
IoT Box <../../general/iot>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
::::

#### Re-issuing a PoS order with an NFC-e error {#localizations/brazil/order-with-nfc-e-error}

If the NFC-e returns an error, follow these steps:

1.  Correct the error.
2.  Re-issue the NFC-e by clicking the `fa-bars`{.interpreted-text
    role="icon"} `(menu)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and
    selecting `Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
3.  Filter the list to show only `Paid`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} orders and click `Details`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}. The error is displayed.
4.  Click `Send NFC-e`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the error has been corrected and the PoS session is closed, Odoo logs
the tax adjustment in the chatter of the related journal entry. The
journal entry for the order indicates that the taxes were incorrectly
calculated. In this case, reprocessing the NFC-e is required.
::::

![Point of sale order view form.](brazil/l10n-br-order-error-screen.png)

#### NFC-e refunds & cancellations {#localizations/brazil/nfc-e-refunds-cancellations}

`Refunds can be processed directly in Odoo <pos/refund>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, but *cancellations* must be performed through the official
government portal.

When the process is finalized, the approved return NF-e is created,
meaning the **previous NFC-e is canceled**.

![Return of Goods NF-e Approved.](brazil/l10n-br-return-succeed.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

SEFAZ only allows cancellation of an NFC-e **within 30 minutes** of its
issuance on the SEFAZ website. After this period, a manual refund must
be processed, along with the issuance of a *Return of Goods NF-e*.

## Chart of accounts {#l10n_ca/coa}

The
`chart of accounts (COA) <../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for the Canadian localization, in Odoo, has accounts grouped
into seven main categories, with corresponding numeric values that
prefix individual journal entries:

- **Receivable**: the balance of money (or credit) due to the business
  for goods or services delivered or used, but not yet paid for by
  customers. `AR (Accounts Receivable)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  is indicated by the journal code labeled (or beginning) with
  `1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- **Payable**: the business\'s short-term obligations owed to its
  creditors or suppliers, which have not yet been paid.
  `AP (Accounts Payable)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is indicated by
  the journal code labeled (or beginning) with `2`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- **Equity**: the amount of money that would be returned to a company\'s
  shareholders if all of the assets were liquidated and all of the
  company\'s debt was paid off in the case of liquidation. Equity is
  indicated by the journal code labeled (or beginning) with
  `3`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `9`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- **Assets**: items listed on the balance sheet that contains economic
  value or have the ability to generate cash flows in the future, such
  as a piece of machinery, a financial security, or a patent. Assets are
  indicated by the journal code labeled (or beginning) with
  `1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- **Liability**: refers to a company\'s financial debts or obligations
  that arise during the course of business operations. Liabilities are
  indicated by the journal code labeled (or beginning) with
  `2`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- **Income**: synonymous with *net income*, this is the profit a company
  retains after paying off all relevant expenses from sales revenue
  earned. Income is indicated by the journal code labeled (or beginning)
  with `4`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `6`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- **Expenses**: the cost of operations that a company incurs to generate
  revenue. Expenses are indicated by the journal code labeled (or
  beginning) with a `6`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Predefined accounts are included in Odoo, as part of the
`CoA (Chart of Accounts)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that\'s
installed with the Canadian localization package. The accounts listed
below are preconfigured to perform certain operations within Odoo. It is
recommended to **not** delete these accounts; however, if changes are
needed, rename the accounts instead.

## Fiscal positions {#l10n_ca/fiscal-positions}

Canadian tax rates and taxable items vary by province and territory.
Default fiscal positions are automatically created when the Odoo
**Accounting** application is installed. To manage or configure
additional fiscal positions, navigate to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Fiscal
Positions`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

The following fiscal positions are available by default:

- `Alberta (AB)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `British Columbia (BC)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Manitoba (MB)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `New Brunswick (NB)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Newfoundland and Labrador (NL)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Nova Scotia (NS)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Northwest Territories (NT)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Nunavut (NU)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Ontario (ON)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Prince Edward Islands (PE)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Quebec (QC)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Saskatchewan (SK)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Yukon (YT)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `International (INTL)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

![The default fiscal positions for the Canada localization in Odoo Accounting.](canada/l10n-ca-fiscal-positions.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When considering what taxes to be applied, it is the province where the
delivery occurs that matters. Therefore, delivery is the responsibility
of the vendor and is accounted for at the customer location.
::::

::: example
\- A delivery is made to a customer from another province. Set the
fiscal position on the customer\'s record to the province of the
customer. - A customer from another province comes to pick up products.
No fiscal position should be set on the customer\'s record. - An
international vendor doesn\'t charge any tax, but taxes are charged by
the customs broker. Set the fiscal position on the vendor\'s record to
*International*. - An international vendor charges provincial tax. Set
the fiscal position on the vendor\'s record to your position.

## Taxes {#l10n_ca/taxes}

In Canada, tax rates and what is considered taxable vary by province and
territory. Default *Sales* and *Purchases* taxes are created
automatically when the Odoo **Accounting** application is installed. To
manage existing or configure additional taxes, navigate to `Accounting
--> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

### AvaTax {#l10n_ca/taxes-avatax}

**Avalara AvaTax** is a cloud-based tax calculation and compliance
software that integrates with Odoo for several localizations, including
Canada. Integrating AvaTax with Odoo provides real-time and
region-specific tax calculations when items are sold, purchased, and
invoiced in the database.

## Reports {#l10n_ca/reports}

A number of
`report selections <../accounting/reporting>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} are readily available for the Canadian localization, under
the `Accounting app --> Reporting`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} drop-down menu:

- `Balance Sheet <accounting/reporting/balance-sheet>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: a \"snapshot\" of a company\'s financial position at a
  specific point in time, which contains an overview of a company\'s
  assets, liabilities, and equity.

  Be sure to select the `Balance sheet (CA)`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"} option from the `fa-book`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} `Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter.

  ![Balance sheet report selection for CA localization in Odoo.](canada/l10n-ca-balance-sheet.png)

- `Profit & Loss <accounting/reporting/balance-sheet>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: otherwise known as a *P&L statement* or *income
  statement*, provides a summary of a company\'s revenues, expenses, and
  profits/losses over a given period of time.

  Be sure to select the `Profit and loss (CA)`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"} option from the `fa-book`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} `Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter.

  ![Profit and loss report selection for CA localization in Odoo.](canada/l10n-ca-profit-loss.png)

- `Cash Flow Statement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: shows how
  much cash and cash equivalents a company has received and spent in a
  given period.

- `Executive Summary <accounting/reporting/executive-summary>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: an overview report that covers the key performance
  indicators of a company\'s financial position, such as revenue,
  profit, and debt.

- `Tax Report <accounting/reporting/tax-report>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: an official form filed for a tax authority that reports
  income, expenses, and other pertinent tax information. Tax reports
  allow taxpayers to calculate their tax liability, schedule tax
  payments, or request refunds for the overpayment of taxes. In Odoo,
  the tax report can be made monthly, every two months, quarterly, every
  4 months, semi-annually, and annually.

## Cash discount {#l10n_ca/cash-discount}

Cash discounts can be configured from
`Accounting app --> Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Each payment term can be set up with a cash
discount and reduced tax.

## Writing checks

The Canadian localization allows users to print checks for vendor
payments. Be sure the *Canadian Checks Layout*
([l10n_ca_check_printing]{.title-ref}) module for the CA localization is
`installed
<general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

To enable check printing from Odoo, navigate to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and find the
`Vendor Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. From here,
tick the `Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox to reveal
several fields for check configuration.

Select a `Check Layout`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
drop-down menu:

- `Print Check (Top) - CA`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Print Check (Middle) - CA`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Print Check (Bottom) - CA`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

Next, choose whether or not to enable the
`Multi-Pages Check Stub`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

Optionally set a `Check Top Margin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Check Left Margin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or `Check
Right Margin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if required.

Tick the `Print Date Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox
if a date label is required.

Once all check configurations are complete, `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} the settings.

:::: tip

## DTE incoming email server {#chile/dte-email}

The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} `Email Box Electronic Invoicing`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} can be defined to receive your customers\' claim and
acceptance emails. Enabling this option from
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Chilean Localization`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} is necessary if you want to use *Email Box
Electronic Invoicing* as the `DTE (Documentos Tributarios
Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} incoming email server.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

In order to receive your SII documents, it\'s necessary to set up your
own email server. More information on how to do this can be found in
this documentation:
`../../general/email_communication`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
::::

Begin by clicking `Configure DTE Incoming Email`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, then click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
add a server and fill in the following fields:

  type used.
  - `IMAP Server`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `POP Server`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `Local Server`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: uses a local
    script to fetch emails and create new records. The script can be
    found in the `Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    section with this option selected.
  - `Gmail OAuth Authentication`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    requires your Gmail API credentials to be configured in the general
    settings. A direct link to the configuration can be found in the
    `Login
    Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.
- `DTE Server`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enable this option.
  By checking this option, this email account will be used to receive
  the electronic invoices from the suppliers, and communications from
  the `SII
  (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  regarding the electronic invoices issued. In this case, this email
  should match both emails declared on the
  `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  site in the section: *ACTUALIZACION DE DATOS DEL CONTRIBUYENTE*, *Mail
  Contacto SII* and *Mail Contacto Empresas*.

In the `Server & Login`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab (for IMAP
and POP servers):

- `Certificate Passkey`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the
  file\'s passphrase.
- `Subject Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: depending
  on the certificate format, the field might not be automatically
  populated. In that case, enter the certificate\'s legal representative
  `RUT
  (Rol Único Tributario)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
- `Certificate Owner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select one if
  you need to restrict the certificate for a specific user. Leave the
  field empty to share it with all billing users.

![Digital certificate configuration.](chile/new-certificate.png){.align-center}

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

If the `Certificate Owner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
set to a specific user, and there are no certificates shared with users,
then the automatic sending of electronic documents and receipt
acknowledgments is **disabled**.

## Multicurrency

The official currency rate is provided by [Chilean
mindicador.cl](https://mindicador.cl). Navigate to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Currencies: Automatic Currency
Rates`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} to set an
`Interval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for when the rate is
automatically updated, or to select another `Service`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

## Partner information {#chile/partner-information}

Configuring partner contacts is also required to send
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
electronic invoices. Open the `Contacts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} app to do so and fill in the following fields on a
new or existing contact form.

sending electronic documents and must be set in the contact that will be
part of an electronic document.
::::

![Chilean electronic invoice data for partners.](chile/dte-email-electronic-invoice.png){.align-center}

## Document types

Accounting documents are categorized by
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}-defined document types.

Document types are created automatically upon installation of the
localization module, and can be managed by navigating to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Document Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![Chilean fiscal document types list.](chile/chilean-document-types.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Several document types are inactive by default but can be activated by
toggling the `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option.
::::

### Use on invoices

The document type on each transaction is determined by:

- The journal related to the invoice, identifying if the journal uses
  documents.
- The condition applied based on the type of issuer and recipient (e.g.,
  the buyer or vendor\'s fiscal regime).

## Journals

*Sales journals* in Odoo usually represent a business unit or location.

::: example
\- Ventas Santiago. - Ventas Valparaiso.
:::

For retail stores it is common to have one journal per
`POS (Point of Sale)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

::: example
\- Cashier 1. - Cashier 2.
:::

The *purchase* transactions can be managed with a single journal, but
sometimes companies use more than one journal in order to handle some
accounting transactions that are not related to vendor bills. This
configuration can easily be set by using the following model.

::: example
\- Tax payments to the government. - Employees payments.
:::

### Create a sales journal

To create a sales journal, navigate to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, and fill in the following required information:

- `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Sale`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu for
  customer invoice journals.
- `Point of sale type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the sales
  journal will be used for electronic documents, the option
  `Online`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be selected.
  Otherwise, if the journal is used for invoices imported from a
  previous system or if you are using the `SII (Servicio de Impuestos
  Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} portal *Facturación MiPyme*,
  you can use the option `Manual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Use Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: check this field
  if the journal will use document types. This field is only applicable
  to purchase and sales journals that can be related to the different
  sets of document types available in Chile. By default, all the sales
  journals created will use documents.

Next, from the `Jounal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
define the `Default Income Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Dedicated Credit Note Squence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
in the `Accounting Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section. Configuring these fields is required for one of the debit notes
`use cases <chile/use-cases>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

## CAF {#chile/caf-documentation}

A *folio authorization code* (CAF) is required for each document type
that will be issued electronically. The
`CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is a
file the `SII (Servicio de
Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} provides to the
issuer with the folios/sequences authorized for the electronic invoice
documents.

Your company can request multiple folios and obtain several
`CAFs (Folio Authorization Codes)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} linked
to different folio ranges. These
`CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are
shared within all journals, so you only need one active
`CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} per
document type, and it will be applied to all journals.

Please refer to the [SII
documentation](https://palena.sii.cl/dte/mn_timbraje.html) to check the
details on how to acquire the
`CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} files.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
required by the `SII (Servicio de Impuestos
Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are different from production
to test (certification mode). Make sure you have the correct
`CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} set
depending on your environment.
::::

### Upload CAF files

Once the `CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
files have been acquired from the `SII
(Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} portal,
they need to be uploaded in the database by navigating to
`Accounting --> Configuration: Chilean SII --> CAFs`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} begin the configuration. On the
`CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form,
upload your `CAF
(Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} file by
clicking the `Upload your file`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button and then click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Once uploaded, the status changes to `In Use`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. At this moment, when a transaction is used for this
document type, the invoice number takes the first folio in the sequence.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The document types have to be active before uploading the
`CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} files.
In case some folios have been used in the previous system, the next
valid folio has to be set when the first transaction is created.
::::

## Chart of accounts

The chart of accounts is installed by default as part of the data set
included in the localization module. The accounts are mapped
automatically in:

- Taxes
- Default Account Payable
- Default Account Receivable
- Transfer Accounts
- Conversion Rate

::: seealso
`../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Taxes

As part of the localization module, taxes are created automatically with
their related financial account and configuration. These taxes can be
managed from `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Chile has several tax types, the most common ones are:

- **VAT**: the regular VAT can have several rates.
- **ILA**: the tax for alcoholic drinks.

::: seealso
`../accounting/taxes`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Usage and testing

### Electronic invoice workflow

In the Chilean localization, the electronic invoice workflow includes
customer invoice issuance and vendor bill reception. The following
diagram explains how information is shared to the `SII
(Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
customers, and vendors.

![Diagram with Electronic invoice transactions.](chile/electronic-invoice-workflow.png){.align-center}

### Customer invoice emission

After the partners and journals are created and configured, the invoices
are created in the standard way. For Chile, one of the differences is
the document type that is automatically selected based on the taxpayer.
The document type can be changed manually if needed on the invoice by
navigating to `Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![Customer invoice document type selection.](chile/customer-invoice-document-type.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

`Documents type 33`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} electronic
invoice must have at least one item with tax, otherwise the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
rejects the document validation.
::::

#### Validation and DTE status {#chile/electronic-invoice-validation}

Once all invoice information is filled, either manually or automatically
when generated from a sales order, validate the invoice. After the
invoice is posted:

- The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} file is created automatically and recorded in the
  chatter.

- The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} status is set as `Pending`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to be sent.

  ![DTE XML File displayed in chatter.](chile/xml-creation.png){.align-center}

The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} status is updated automatically by Odoo with a scheduled
action that runs every day at night, if the response from the
`SII (Servicio de
Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is needed
immediately, you can do it manually as well by following the
`DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} status workflow:

![Transition of DTE status flow.](chile/dte-status-flow.png){.align-center}

1.  The first step is to send the
    `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} to the `SII
    (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
    This can be sent manually by clicking the `Enviar
    Ahora`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. This generates a
    `SII Tack number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
    invoice, which is used to check the details sent by the
    `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} via email. Then, the `DTE status`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} is updated to `Ask for Status`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

2.  Once the `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} response is received, Odoo updates the
    `DTE status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To do it manually,
    click on the button `Verify on SII`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}. The result can either be
    `Accepted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Accepted With Objection`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `Rejected`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

    ![Identification transaction for invoice and Status update.](chile/dte-status-steps.png){.align-center}

    :::: important
    ::: title
    Important
    :::

    There are intermediate statuses in the
    `SII (Serviciqo de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} before acceptance or rejection. It\'s recommended to
    **NOT** continuously click `Verify in
    SII`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for smooth processing.

    ![Electronic invoice data statuses.](chile/chatter-internal-statuses.png){.align-center}
    ::::

3.  The final response from the
    `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} can take on one of these values:

    - `Accepted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: indicates the
      invoice information is correct, our document is now fiscally valid
      and it\'s automatically sent to the customer.

    - `Accepted with objections`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
      indicates the invoice information is correct, but a minor issue
      was identified, nevertheless the document is now fiscally valid
      and it\'s automatically sent to the customer.

    - `Rejected`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: indicates the
      invoice information is incorrect and must be corrected. Details
      are sent to emails you registered in the
      `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
      role="abbr"}. If it is properly configured in Odoo, the details
      are also retrieved in the chatter once the email server is
      processed.

      If the invoice is rejected please follow these steps:

      1.  Change the document to `Draft`{.interpreted-text
          role="guilabel"}.
      2.  Make the required corrections based on the message received
          from the `SII (Servicio
          de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in the
          chatter.
      3.  Post the invoice again.

      ![Message when an invoice is rejected.](chile/rejected-invoice.png){.align-center}

#### Crossed references

When the invoice is created, as a result of another fiscal document, the
information related to the originator document must be registered in the
`Cross-Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. This tab is
commonly used for credit or debit notes, however, in some cases it can
be used for customer invoices, as well. In the case of the credit and
debit notes, they are set automatically by Odoo.

![Crossed referenced document(s).](chile/cross-reference-tab-registration.png){.align-center}

#### Invoice PDF report {#chile/electronic-invoice-pdf-report}

Once the invoice is accepted and validated by the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
and the PDF is printed, it includes the fiscal elements that indicate
that the document is fiscally valid.

![Fiscal elements and barcode printed in accepted invoices.](chile/accepted-invoice-fiscal-information.png)

If you are hosted in Odoo SH or On-Premise, you should manually install
the [pdf417gen](https://pypi.org/project/pdf417gen/) library. Use the
following command to install it:
`pip install pdf417gen`{.interpreted-text role="command"}.
::::

#### Commercial validation

Once the invoice has been sent to the customer:

1.  `DTE Partner Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} changes to
    `Sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
2.  The customer must send a reception confirmation email.
3.  Subsequently, if commercial terms and invoice data are correct, an
    acceptance confirmation is sent; otherwise, a claim is sent.
4.  The field `DTE Acceptance Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    is updated automatically.

![Message with the commercial acceptance from the customer.](chile/partner-dte-status.png){.align-center}

#### Processed for claimed invoices

Once the invoice has been accepted by the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
**it can not be cancelled in Odoo**. In case you get a claim for your
customer, the correct way to proceed is with a credit note to either
cancel the invoice or correct it. Please refer to the
`chile/credit-notes`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} section for more
details.

![Invoice Commercial status updated to claimed.](chile/accepted-invoice.png){.align-center}

#### Common errors

There are multiple reasons behind a rejection from the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
but these are some of the common errors you might have and how to solve
them:

- | **Error:** [RECHAZO- DTE Sin Comuna Origen]{.title-ref}
  | **Hint:** make sure the company address is properly filled including
    the state and city.

- | **Error:** [en Monto - IVA debe declararse]{.title-ref}
  | **Hint:** the invoice lines should include one VAT tax, make sure
    you add one on each invoice line.

- | **Error:** [Rut No Autorizado a Firmar]{.title-ref}
  | **Hint:** the `RUT (Rol Único Tributario)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} entered is not allowed to invoice electronically, make
    sure the company `RUT (Rol Único Tributario)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} is correct and is valid in the
    `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} to invoice electronically.

- | **Error:** [Fecha/Número Resolucion Invalido RECHAZO- CAF Vencido :
    (Firma_DTE\[AAAA-MM-DD\] - CAF\[AAAA-MM-DD\]) &gt; 6
    meses]{.title-ref}
  | **Hint:** try to add a new CAF related to this document as the one
    you\'re using is expired.

- | **Error:** [Element \'{http://www.sii.cl/SiiDte%7DRutReceptor\':
    This element is not expected. Expected is (
    {http://www.sii.cl/SiiDte%7DRutEnvia ).]{.title-ref}
  | **Hint:** Make sure the field `Document Type`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} and `VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are
    set in the customer and in the main company.

- | **Error:** [Usuario sin permiso de envio.]{.title-ref}
  | **Hint:** this error indicates that most likely, your company has
    not passed the [Certification
    process](https://www.sii.cl/factura_electronica/factura_mercado/proceso_certificacion.htm)
    in the `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} - Sistema de Facturación de Mercado. If this is the
    case, please contact your Account Manager or Customer Support as
    this certification is not part of the Odoo services, but we can give
    you some alternatives. If you already passed the certification
    process, this error appears when a user different from the owner of
    the certificate is trying to send
    `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} files to the
    `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"}.

- | **Error:** [CARATULA]{.title-ref}
  | **Hint:** there are just five reasons why this error could show up
    and all of them are related to the *Caratula* section of the XML:

  > - The company\'s `RUT (Rol Único Tributario)`{.interpreted-text
  >   role="abbr"} number is incorrect or missing.
  > - The certificate owner
  >   `RUT (Rol Único Tributario)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} number
  >   is incorrect or missing.
  > - The `SII's (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
  >   role="abbr"} `RUT (Rol Único Tributario)`{.interpreted-text
  >   role="abbr"} number (this should be correct by default) is
  >   incorrect or missing.
  > - The resolution date is incorrect or missing.
  > - The resolution number is incorrect or missing.

### Credit notes {#chile/credit-notes}

When a cancellation or correction is needed over a validated invoice, a
credit note must be generated. It is important to consider that a
`CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} file is
required for the credit note, which is identified as
`Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`61`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
Please refer to the `CAF section
<chile/caf-documentation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for more
information on the process to load the `CAF (Folio
Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} on each document
type.

![Creation of CAF for Credit notes.](chile/credit-note-document-type.png){.align-center}

#### Use cases

##### Cancel referenced document

In case you need to cancel or invalidate an invoice, navigate to
`Accounting -->
Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
select the desired invoice. Then, use the button `Add Credit
Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select
`Full Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, in this case the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos
Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} reference code is
automatically set to `Anula Documento de referencia`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Credit note cancelling the referenced document.](chile/credit-note-cancel-ref-doc.png){.align-center}

##### Correct referenced document

If a correction in the invoice information is required, for example the
street name on the original invoice is wrong, then use the button
`Add Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select
`Partial Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select the
option `Only Text Correction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In
this case the `SII Reference
Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is automatically set to
`Corrects Referenced Document Text`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Credit note correcting referenced document text.](chile/credit-note-correct-text.png){.align-center}

Odoo creates a credit note with the corrected text in an invoice and
`Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} [0.00]{.title-ref}.

![Credit note with the corrected value on the invoice lines.](chile/text-correction-label.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Make sure to define the `Default Credit Account`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the sales journal specifically for this use case.
::::

##### Corrects referenced document amount

When a correction on the amounts is required, use the button
`Add Credit note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select
`Partial Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In this case the
`SII Reference Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is automatically
set to `Corrige el monto del Documento de Referencia`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Credit note for partial refund to correct amounts, using the SII reference code 3.](chile/credit-note-correct-amount.png){.align-center}

### Debit notes

In Chilean localization, debit notes, in addition to credit notes, can
be created using the `Add Debit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button, with two main use cases.

#### Use cases {#chile/use-cases}

##### Add debt on invoices

The primary use case for debit notes is to increase the value of an
existing invoice. To do so, select option
`3. Corrige el monto del Documento de Referencia`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for the `Reference Code SII`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

![Debit note correcting referenced document amount.](chile/debit-note-correct-amount.png){.align-center}

In this case Odoo automatically includes the
`Source Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the `Cross
Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![Automatic reference to invoice in a debit note.](chile/auto-ref-debit-note.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can only add debit notes to an invoice already accepted by the SII.
::::

##### Cancel credit notes

In Chile, debits notes are used to cancel a valid credit note. To do
this, click the `Add
Debit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and select the
`1: Anula Documentos de referencia`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option for the `Reference Code SII`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

![Debit note to cancel the referenced document (credit note).](chile/debit-note-cancel-ref-doc.png){.align-center}

### Vendor bills

As part of the Chilean localization, you can configure your incoming
email server to match the one you have registered in the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in
order to:

- Automatically receive the vendor bills
  `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} and create the vendor bill based on this information.
- Automatically send the reception acknowledgement to your vendor.
- Accept or claim the document and send this status to your vendor.

#### Reception

As soon as the vendor email with the attached
`DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is received:

1.  The vendor bill maps all the information included in the XML.
2.  An email is sent to the vendor with the reception acknowledgement.
3.  The `DTE Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set as
    `Acuse de Recibido Enviado`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

#### Acceptation

If all the commercial information is correct on your vendor bill, then
you can accept the document using the
`Aceptar Documento`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. Once this
is done, the `DTE Acceptation
Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} changes to
`Accepted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and an email of acceptance
is sent to the vendor.

![Button for accepting vendor bills.](chile/accept-vendor-bill-btn.png){.align-center}

#### Claim

In case there is a commercial issue or the information is not correct on
your vendor bill, you can claim the document before validating it, using
the `Claim`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. Once this is
done, the `DTE Acceptation Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
changes to `Claim`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a rejection
email is sent to the vendor.

![Claim button in vendor bills to inform the vendor all the document is commercially
rejected.
:align: center](chile/claim-vendor-bill-btn.png)

If you claim a vendor bill, the status changes from
`Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to `Cancel`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} automatically. Considering this as best practice, all
the claimed documents should be cancelled as they won\'t be valid for
your accounting records.

### Electronic purchase invoice

The *electronic purchase invoice* is a feature included in the
[l10n_cl_edi]{.title-ref} module.

Once all configurations have been made for
`electronic invoices <chile/electronic-invoice>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (e.g., uploading a valid company certificate, setting up
master data, etc.), the electronic purchase invoices need their own
`CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Please
refer to the
`CAF documentation <chile/caf-documentation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to check the details on how to acquire the
`CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for
electronic purchase invoices.

Electronic purchase invoices are useful when vendors are not obligated
to expedite an electronic vendor bill for your purchase. Still, your
obligations require a document to be sent to the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} as
proof of purchase.

#### Configuration

To generate an electronic purchase invoice from a vendor bill, the bill
must be created in a purchase journal with the *Use Documents* feature
enabled. It is possible to modify an existing purchase journal or create
a new one in the following process.

To modify the existing purchase journal, or create a new purchase
journal, navigate to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, and fill in the following required information:

- `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu
  for vendor bill journals.
- `Use Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: check this field
  so the journal can generate electronic documents (in this case the
  electronic purchase invoice).

#### Generate an electronic purchase invoice

To generate this type of document, it is necessary to create a vendor
bill in Odoo. To do so, navigate to
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Bills`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

When all of the electronic purchase invoice information is filled,
select the option `(46)
Electronic Purchase Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field:

After the vendor bill is posted:

- The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} file (Electronic Tax Document) is automatically created
  and added to the chatter.
- The `DTE SII Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set as
  `Pending to be sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Odoo automatically updates the *DTE Status* every night using a
scheduled action. To get a response from the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
immediately, click the `Send now to
SII`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

### Delivery guide

To install the `Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
module, go to `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and search
for [Chile (l10n_cl)]{.title-ref}. Then click
`Install`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the module
`Chile - E-Invoicing Delivery
Guide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`Chile - E-Invoicing Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
has a dependency with `Chile -
Facturación Electrónica`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Odoo will
install the dependency automatically when the
`Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} module is installed.
::::

The *Delivery Guide* module includes the ability to send the
`DTE (Documentos Tributarios
Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
and the stamp in PDF reports for deliveries.

Once all configurations have been made for
`electronic invoices <chile/electronic-invoice>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (e.g., uploading a valid company certificate, setting up
master data, etc.), delivery guides need their own
`CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Please
refer to the `CAF documentation
<chile/caf-documentation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to check the
details on how to acquire the `CAF (Folio
Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for electronic
Delivery Guides.

Verify the following important information in the
`Price for the Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
configuration:

- `From Sales Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: delivery guide
  takes the product price from the sales order and shows it on the
  document.
- `From Product Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Odoo takes
  the price configured in the product template and shows it on the
  document.
- `No show price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: no price is shown
  in the delivery guide.

Electronic delivery guides are used to move stock from one place to
another and they can represent sales, sampling, consignment, internal
transfers, and basically any product move.

#### Delivery guide from a sales process

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

A delivery guide should **not** be longer than one page or contain more
than 60 product lines.
::::

When a sales order is created and confirmed, a delivery order is
generated. After validating the delivery order, the option to create a
delivery guide is activated.

![Create Delivery Guide button on a sales process.](chile/delivery-guide-creation-btn.png){.align-center}

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

When clicking on `Create Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for the first time, a warning message pops up, stating
the following:

[No se encontró una secuencia para la guía de despacho. Por favor,
establezca el primer número dentro del campo número para la guía de
despacho]{.title-ref}

![First Delivery Guide number warning message.](chile/delivery-guide-number-warning.png){.align-center}
::::

This warning message means the user needs to indicate the next sequence
number Odoo has to take to generate the delivery guide (e.g. next
available `CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} number), and only happens the first time a delivery guide
is created in Odoo. After the first document has been correctly
generated, Odoo takes the next available number in the
`CAF (Folio Authorization
Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} file to generate the following
delivery guide.

After the delivery guide is created:

- The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} file (Electronic Tax Document) is automatically created
  and added to the `chatter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- The `DTE SII Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set as
  `Pending to be sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Chatter notes of Delivery Guide creation.](chile/chatter-delivery-guide.png){.align-center}

The `DTE Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is automatically
updated by Odoo with a scheduled action that runs every night. To get a
response from the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
immediately, press the `Send now to SII`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

Once the delivery guide is sent, it may then be printed by clicking on
the `Print Delivery
Guide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![Printing Delivery Guide PDF.](chile/print-delivery-guide-btn.png){.align-center}

Delivery guide will have fiscal elements that indicate that the document
is fiscally valid when printed (if hosted in *Odoo SH* or on
*On-premise* remember to manually add the `pdf417gen`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} library mentioned in the `Invoice PDF report section
<chile/electronic-invoice-pdf-report>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).

### Electronic receipt

To install the `Electronic Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
module, go to `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and search
for [Chile (l10n_cl)]{.title-ref}. Then click
`Install`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the module
`Chile - Electronic
Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`Chile - Electronic Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} has a
dependency with `Chile - Facturación
Electrónica`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Odoo will install the
dependency automatically when the `E-invoicing
Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} module is installed.
::::

Once all configurations have been made for
`electronic invoices <chile/electronic-invoice>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (e.g., uploading a valid company certificate, setting up
master data, etc.), electronic receipts need their own
`CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Please
refer to the `CAF documentation
<chile/caf-documentation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to check the
details on how to acquire the `CAFs (Folio
Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for electronic
receipts.

Electronic receipts are useful when clients do not need an electronic
invoice. By default, there is a partner in the database called
`Anonymous Final Consumer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with a
generic `RUT (Rol
Único Tributario)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
[66666666-6]{.title-ref} and taxpayer type of
`Final Consumer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This partner can be
used for electronic receipts or a new record may be created for the same
purpose.

![Electronic Receipt module.](chile/electronic-receipt-customer.png){.align-center}

Although electronic receipts should be used for final consumers with a
generic `RUT (Rol Único
Tributario)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, it can also be used for
specific partners. After the partners and journals are created and
configured, the electronic receipts are created in the standard way as
electronic invoice, but the type of document
`(39) Electronic Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should be
selected in the invoice form:

![Document type 39 for Electronic Receipts.](chile/document-type-39.png){.align-center}

#### Validation and DTE status

When all of the electronic receipt information is filled, manually (or
automatically) proceed to validate the receipt from the sales order. By
default, `Electronic Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
selected as the `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
however in order to validate the receipt correctly, make sure to edit
the `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and change to
`Electronic Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

After the receipt is posted:

- The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} file (Electronic Tax Document) is created automatically
  and added to the `chatter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- The `DTE SII Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set as
  `Pending to be sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Electronic Receipts STE creation status.](chile/electronic-receipt-ste-status.png){.align-center}

The `DTE Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is automatically
updated by Odoo with a scheduled action that runs every day at night. To
get a response from the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
immediately, press the `Send now to SII`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

Please refer to the
`DTE Workflow <chile/electronic-invoice-validation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for electronic invoices as the workflow for electronic
receipt follows the same process.

### Electronic export of goods

Electronic invoices for the export of goods are tax documents that are
used not only for the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
but are also used with customs and contain the information required by
it.

#### Contact configurations

![Taxpayer Type needed for the Electronic Exports of Goods module.](chile/taxpayer-type-export-goods.png){.align-center}

#### Chilean customs

When creating an electronic exports of goods invoice, these new fields
in the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab are required
to comply with Chilean regulations.

![Chilean customs fields.](chile/chilean-custom-fields.png){.align-center}

#### PDF report

Once the invoice is accepted and validated by the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
and the PDF is printed, it includes the fiscal elements that indicate
that the document is fiscally valid and a new section needed for
customs.

### eCommerce electronic invoicing

To install the `Chilean eCommerce`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
module, go to `` Apps, search for the
module by its technical name `l10n_cl_edi_website_sale ``{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click the `Activate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

![l10n_cl eCommerce module.](chile/ecommerce-module-chile.png){.align-center}

This module enables the features and configurations to:

- Generate electronic documents from the *eCommerce* application
- Support for required fiscal fields in the *eCommerce* application
- Effectively let the final client decide the electronic document to be
  generated for their purchase

Once all of the configurations are made for the Chilean
`electronic invoice
<chile/electronic-invoice>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} flow, the
following configurations are required for the eCommerce flow to be
integrated.

To configure your website to generate electronic documents during the
sale process, go to
`Website --> Configuration --> Settings --> Invoicing`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and activate the
`Automatic Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature.
Activating this feature allows electronic documents to be automatically
generated when an online payment is confirmed.

![Invoice Policy and Automatic Invoice configurations.](chile/website-configurations-ecommerce-chile.png){.align-center}

Since an online payment needs to be confirmed for the *automatic
invoice* feature to generate the document, a payment provider must be
configured for the related website.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Review the `../payment_providers`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation for information on which payment providers are supported
in Odoo, and how to configure them.
::::

It is also recommended to configure your products so they are able to be
invoiced when an online payment is confirmed. To do so, go to
`Website --> eCommerce --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the product template of the desired
product. Then, set the `Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to `Ordered quantities`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Invoice Policy configuration in Products.](chile/ordered-quantities-product.png){.align-center}

#### Invoicing flows

Clients from Chile will be able to select if they need an **invoice** or
a **ballot** for their purchase with an extra step added during the
checkout process.

![Option for EDI Documents for clients.](chile/select-edi-docs-ecommerce.png){.align-center}

If the customer selects the `Electronic Invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option, fiscal fields are required to be filled out,
including the `Activity Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
the `Identification Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and their
`DTE Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If the client selects the `Electronic Receipts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option, they will be directed to the next step, and the
electronic document will be generated for the *Consumidor Final Anónimo*
contact.

Clients from countries other than Chile, will have their electronic
receipts automatically generated for them by Odoo.

### Point of Sale electronic invoicing

To install the `Chilean Module for Point of Sale`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, go to the `Apps`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} application on the main Odoo dashboard, search for
the module by its technical name [l10n_cl_edi_pos]{.title-ref}, and
click the `Activate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![l10n_cl POS EDI module.](chile/pos-edi-module-chile.png){.align-center}

This module enables the following features and configurations to:

- Generate electronic documents from the *Point of Sale* application
- Support the required fiscal fields for contacts created in the *Point
  of Sale* application
- Effectively lets the final client decide the type of electronic
  document to be generated for their purchase
- Print QR or 5-digit codes in tickets to access to electronic invoices

To configure contacts with the required fiscal information, review the
`partner information
<chile/partner-information>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} section, or
directly modify a contact. Navigate to
`Point of Sale --> Session --> Customers --> Details`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and edit any of the following fields:

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Identification Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Tax Payer Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Type Giro`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `DTE Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `RUT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

![Contact with fiscal information created from POS.](chile/fiscal-required-pos-session.png){.align-center}

To configure the products, navigate to
`Point of Sale --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select a product record. In the
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the product form, it
is necessary to mark the product as
`Available for POS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, this makes the
product available for sale in the *Point of Sale* app.

![Product with fiscal information created from POS.](chile/available-in-pos-product.png){.align-center}

Optionally, the following features are available for configuration in
the `Point of
Sale --> Configuration --> Settings --> Bills & Receipts section`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}:

- `Use QR code on ticket`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this
  feature enables a QR code to be printed on the user\'s receipt so they
  can easily request an invoice after their purchase
- `Generate a code on ticket`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this
  feature enables a 5-digit code to be generated on the receipt,
  allowing the user to request an invoice through the customer portal

![Configuration to generate QR or 5 digit codes on tickets.](chile/qr-code-ticket.png){.align-center}

#### Invoicing flows

The following sections cover the invoicing flows for the *Point of Sale*
application.

##### Electronic receipts: anonymous end user

When making a purchase as an anonymous user that does not request an
electronic invoice, Odoo automatically selects
`Consumidor Final Anónimo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as the
contact for the order and generates the electronic receipt.

![Automatic contact selection of an anonymous end consumer.](chile/invoice-receipt-selection.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the client requests a credit note due to a return of their purchase,
the credit note should be made using the *Accounting* app. See the
`credit notes and refunds
<../accounting/customer_invoices/credit_notes>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation for detailed instructions.
::::

##### Electronic receipts: specific customer

When specific user makes a purchase that does not request an electronic
invoice, Odoo automatically selects the contact for the order as the
`Consumidor Final Anónimo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
allows you to select or create the required customer contact with their
fiscal information for the receipt.

![Selection of contact for the receipt.](chile/contact-for-electronic-invoice.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the client requests a credit note because of a return of this type of
purchase, the credit note and return process can be managed directly
from the `POS (Point of Sale)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} session.
::::

##### Electronic invoices

When clients request an electronic invoice, it is possible to select or
create the required contact with their fiscal information. When the
payment is being made, select the option `Invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to generate the document.

![Selection of invoice option at payment.](chile/invoice-option-at-payment.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

For both the electronic receipts and invoices, if the product is not
affected by taxes, Odoo detects this and generates the correct type of
document for tax-exempt sales.
::::

##### Returns

For electronic receipts (not generated for the *Consumidor Final
Anónimo*) and electronic invoices, it is possible to manage the process
to return products sold in a `POS (Point of Sale)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} order by selecting the `Refund`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

![Refund option in the POS application.](chile/refund-order.png){.align-center}

Orders can be searched by the order status or by contact, and be
selected for the refund to be based on the client\'s original order.

![Selection of order for the refund process.](chile/select-order-refund.png){.align-center}

When the return payment is validated, Odoo generates the necessary
credit note, referencing the original receipt or invoice, partially or
fully cancelling the document.

#### Sales journals {#localization/colombia/co-journals}

Once the
`DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} has assigned the official sequence and prefix for the
electronic invoice resolution, the sales journals related to the
invoices **must** be updated in Odoo. To do so, navigate to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select an existing sales journal or create a
new one with the `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

On the sales journal form, enter the `Journal Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then set
a unique `Short Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Journals Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Then,
configure the following data in the
`Advanced Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:

- `Electronic invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enable UBL
  2.1 (Colombia).
- `Invoicing Resolution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: resolution
  number issued by
  `DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} to the company via their test set.
- `Resolution Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: initial
  effective date of the resolution.
- `Resolution End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: end date of
  the resolution\'s validity.
- `Range of Numbering (minimum)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  first authorized invoice number.
- `Range of Numbering (maximum)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  last authorized invoice number.
- `Technical Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: control key
  received from the
  `DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} portal test set or from their web service in case of the
  production environment.

When the database is configured for the `production environment
<localization/colombia/einvoice-configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, instead of configuring these fields manually, click the
`Reload DIAN configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
obtain the
`DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} resolution information from the
`DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} web service.

![Reload DIAN configuration button in sale journals.](colombia/reload-dian-configuration-button.png)

\- The short code and resolution of the journal **must** match the ones
received in the
`DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} portal test set or from the MUISCA portal. - The
`invoice sequence and prefix <localization/colombia/invoice-creation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **must** be correctly configured when the first invoice is
created. Odoo automatically assigns a prefix and sequence to the
following invoices.
::::

#### Purchase journals {#localization/colombia/purchase-journals}

Once the
`DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} has assigned the official sequence and prefix for the
*support document* related to vendor bills, the purchase journals
related to their supporting documents need to be updated in Odoo. The
process is similar to the configuration of the `sales journals
<localization/colombia/co-journals>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

::: seealso
For more information on support document journals using the Carvajal
solution, review the [Documento Soporte - Localización de Colombia
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmYsFcD7xzE&list=PL1-aSABtP6ABxZshems3snMjx7bj_7ZsZ&index=8).
:::

#### Chart of accounts {#localization/colombia/chart-of-accounts}

The
`chart of accounts </applications/finance/accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is installed by default as part of the localization module.
The accounts are mapped automatically in taxes, default account payable,
and default account receivable. The chart of accounts for Colombia is
based on the PUC (Plan Unico de Cuentas).

### Multicurrency {#localization/colombia/workflows}

The official exchange rate for Colombia is provided by the [Banco de la
República](https://suameca.banrep.gov.co/estadisticas-economicas/).

To enable automatic exchange rate updates, follow these steps:

1.  Go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
2.  Navigate to the `Currencies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    section and enable `Automatic Currency Rates`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.
3.  Ensure that `[CO] Bank of the Republic`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} is selected as the `Service`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.
4.  Select an `Interval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for how
    frequently the currency rate should be automatically updated.

## Main workflows

### Electronic invoices {#localization/colombia/electronic-invoices}

The following is a breakdown of the main workflow for electronic
invoices with the Colombian localization:

1.  The user creates an invoice.
2.  Odoo generates the legal XML file.
3.  Odoo generates the CUFE (Invoice Electronic Code) with the
    electronic signature.
4.  Odoo sends a notification to DIAN.
5.  `DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} validates the invoice.
6.  `DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} accepts or rejects the invoice.
7.  Odoo generates the PDF invoice with a QR code.
8.  Odoo compresses the attached document (containing the sent XML file
    and the DIAN validation response) and the fiscal valid PDF into a
    `.zip`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file.
9.  The user sends the invoice (`.zip`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
    file) via Odoo to the acquirer.

#### Invoice creation {#localization/colombia/invoice-creation}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The functional workflow taking place before an invoice validation does
**not** alter the main changes introduced with the electronic invoice.
::::

Electronic invoices are generated and sent to both the
`DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and the customer. These documents can be created from the
sales order or manually generated. To create a new invoice, go to
`Accounting --> Costumers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. On the invoice form, configure the following fields:

- `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: customer\'s
  information.
- `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: journal used for
  electronic invoices.
- `Electronic Invoice Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
  the type of document. By default, `Factura
  de Venta`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected.
- `Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Specify the
  products with the correct taxes.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When creating the first invoice related to an electronic invoicing
journal, it is required to manually change the *sequence* of the invoice
to the
`DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} format: [Prefix + Sequence]{.title-ref}.

For example, format the sequence from [SETP/2024/00001]{.title-ref} to
[SETP1]{.title-ref}.
::::

When done, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

#### Electronic invoice sending {#localization/colombia/send-electronic-invoice}

After the
`invoice confirmation <localization/colombia/invoice-creation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, click `Print & Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In
the wizard that appears, make sure to enable the
`DIAN`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `Email`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkboxes to send an XML to the
`DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} web service and the validated invoice to the client fiscal
email and click `Print & Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then:

- The XML document is created.
- The CUFE is generated.
- The XML is processed synchronously by the
  `DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"}.
- If accepted, the file is displayed in the chatter and the email to the
  client with the corresponding `.zip`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
  file.

![EDI documents available in the chatter.](colombia/zip-xml-chatter-colombia.png)

The `DIAN`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab then displays the
following:

- `Signed Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: timestamp recorded
  of the XML creation.
- `Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Status result obtained in
  the
  `DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} response. If the invoice was rejected, the error messages
  can be seen here.
- `Testing Environment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: To know if
  the document sent was delivered to the
  `DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} testing environment.
- `Certification Process`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: To know if
  the document was sent as part of the certification process with the
  `DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"}.
- `Download`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: To download the sent
  XML file, even if the
  `DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} result was rejected.
- `Fetch Attached Document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: To
  download the generated attached document file included in the
  delivered `.zip`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file to the client.

![EDI document record available in DIAN tab.](colombia/dian-tab-electronic-document.png)

### Credit notes {#localization/colombia/credit-notes}

The process for credit notes is the same as for invoices. To create a
credit note with reference to an invoice, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. On the invoice, click
`Add Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and complete the
following information:

- `Credit Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the type of
  credit method.
  - `Partial Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Use this option
    when it is a partial amount.
  - `Full Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Use this option if
    the credit note is for the full amount.
  - `Full refund and new draft invoice`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}: Use this option if the credit note is
    auto-validated and reconciled with the invoice. The original invoice
    is duplicated as a new draft.
- `Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the reason for the
  credit note.
- `Reversal Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select if you want
  a specific date for the credit note or if it is the journal entry
  date.
- `Use Specific Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  journal for your credit note or leave it empty if you want to use the
  same journal as the original invoice.
- `Refund Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If you chose a
  specific date, select the date for the refund.

Once reviewed, click the `Reverse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button.

### Debit notes {#localization/colombia/debit-notes}

The process for debit notes is similar to credit notes. To create a
debit note with reference to an invoice, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. On the invoice, click the
`Add Debit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and enter
the following information:

- `Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Type the reason for the
  debit note.
- `Debit note date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  specific options.
- `Copy lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this option if
  you need to register a debit note with the same lines of invoice.
- `Use Specific Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  printer point for your debit note, or leave it empty if you want to
  use the same journal as the original invoice.

When done, click `Create Debit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Support document for vendor bills {#localization/colombia/support-document}

With master data, credentials, and the purchase journal configured for
support documents related to vendor bills, you can start using *support
documents*.

Support documents for vendor bills can be created from your purchase
order or manually. Go to
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Bills`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and fill in the following data:

- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the vendor\'s
  information.
- `Bill Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the date of the
  bill.
- `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the journal for
  support documents related to the vendor bills.
- `Invoiced Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Specify the
  products with the correct taxes.

Once reviewed, click the `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button. Upon confirmation, an XML file is created and automatically sent
to Carvajal.

### Common errors {#localization/colombia/common-errors}

During the XML validation, the most common errors are related to missing
`master data
<localization/colombia/master-data>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. In
such cases, a validation error message is displayed and sending is
blocked.

If the invoice was sent and set as *Rejected* by the
`DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, the error messages are visible by clicking the
`fa-info-circle`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(info circle)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon next to the
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field in the
`DIAN`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Using the reported error
codes, it is possible to review solutions to apply before re-sending.

![Example of error messages on rejected invoices.](colombia/rejected-invoice-error-message.png)

After the master data or other issues are corrected, it is possible to
reprocess the XML again. Do so by following the
`electronic invoice sending <localization/colombia/send-electronic-invoice>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} flow.

## Financial reports {#localization/colombia/reports}

# Denmark

## Compliance with Danish bookkeeping requirements: data retention and integrity

This page outlines how Odoo complies with the Danish Bookkeeping Act,
specifically regarding the storage and integrity of financial
transactions and receipts. Odoo recognizes the importance of adhering to
Danish regulations and has implemented robust measures to ensure
clients\' data is secure and compliant.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo's registration as a digital bookkeeping system has been confirmed
by the Danish Business Authority under registration numbers
[fob585505]{.title-ref} and [fob441967]{.title-ref}. Customers must meet
certain conditions to benefit from it, as outlined below.
::::

### Key requirements of the Danish Bookkeeping Act

The Danish Bookkeeping Act (DBA) outlines the [requirements for digital
bookkeping
systems](https://danishbusinessauthority.dk/requirements-digital-bookkeeping-systems):

- **Retain transactional data and receipts:** Store all recorded
  transactions and receipts covered by § 3 for a minimum of five years
  from the end of the financial year to which they pertain.
- **Ensure data integrity:** Prevent the customer from changing,
  backdating, or deleting recorded transactions.
- **Maintain data accessibility:** Store all recorded transactions in a
  structured and machine-readable format for the required five-year
  period, regardless of customer relationship status, bankruptcy, or
  dissolution.
- **Provide decryption capabilities:** Ensure that encrypted bookkeeping
  data and receipts can be decrypted into a structured and readable
  format.

### Odoo Compliance

Odoo\'s registration as digital standard bookkeeping systems with the
Danish Business Authority confirms that Odoo meets the applicable
criteria for digital bookkeeping systems in Denmark, in accordance with
the requirements of the `DBA (Danish Bookkeeping Act)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

However, to benefit from all the required guarantees for digital
bookkeeping systems in Denmark, customers must meet a few conditions.

#### Conditions for full DBA compliance

- The customer uses Odoo Accounting on the Odoo SaaS platform (Odoo
  Online);
- The customer has an active Odoo subscription (e.g., Standard or Custom
  Plan), or their database is managed by an officially registered [Odoo
  Accounting Firm](https://www.odoo.com/accounting-firms);
- The customer refrains from customizations or actions intended to
  undermine the system's immutability, traceability, or security
  controls.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Customers using Odoo products outside these conditions are responsible
for ensuring their own compliance with the DBA.
::::

When the above conditions are met, the requirements of the DBA are
fulfilled through features and processes described in the following
sections.

### Immutable transaction records

- Once transactions are recorded, they cannot be deleted through the
  user interface.
- All modifications are logged, providing a complete audit trail.
- While historically dated entries can be made, Odoo records the
  creation date and time of the entry.

### Secure document storage

- Receipts and digital vouchers are stored as attachments and integrated
  into the database, ensuring they are included in backups.
- Posted documents cannot be deleted.
- We fully support the storage of mandatory digital vouchers as defined
  by Danish regulations.

### Continuous data availability

- Clients with active subscriptions can access all transactions and
  digital vouchers through Odoo.
- Regardless of customer relations, bankruptcy, or dissolution, Odoo can
  provide access to transaction and digital voucher details to former
  clients for six years (see
  `localizations/denmark/data-lifecycle`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).

### Automated data export and secure storage

- Odoo Accounting implements no automatic deletion or archival of
  recorded transactions, so if a customer has been recording
  transactions for six years, the six years of history are preserved in
  the Odoo Accounting database.
- As described in the [Odoo Cloud Hosting
  SLA](https://www.odoo.com/cloud-sla) and [Odoo Privacy
  Policy](https://www.odoo.com/privacy), the Odoo Cloud relies on
  immutable daily snapshot backups, which cannot be individually altered
  or deleted, even at the customer\'s request, ensuring their integrity.
- All documents and receipts stored in a database backup are available
  as a standard ZIP archive accompanying the SQL dump.

### Data lifecycle management {#localizations/denmark/data-lifecycle}

- Odoo database backups are available in standard SQL dump formats at
  all times and include all recorded transactions.
- The [Odoo Cloud Hosting SLA](https://www.odoo.com/cloud-sla)
  guarantees three months of backup history to all active customers. As
  a special guarantee for Danish customers subject to the DBA and
  meeting the conditions highlighted above the last Odoo Cloud backup
  retention gets increased to six years as soon as they decide to
  terminate their Odoo Cloud subscription, in order to comply with the
  requirements of Annex 1, 4 of Executive Order 97.

### Decryption

Odoo Accounting customer data on the Odoo Cloud is always stored in
encrypted form (encryption at rest at storage level). When backups are
retrieved, they are automatically decrypted and provided in decrypted
form in standard formats for the user: SQL dumps + ZIP archive of all
attached documents (file store).

# Ecuador

With the Ecuadorian localization, electronic documents can be generated
using XML, fiscal folio, electronic signature, and direct connection to
tax authority SRI.

The supported documents are invoices, credit notes, debit notes,
purchase liquidations, and withholdings.

The localization also includes automation to easily predict the
withholding tax to be applied to each purchase invoice.

## Localization overview {#localizations/ecuador/specifics}

The Ecuadorian localization package ensures compliance with Ecuadorian
fiscal and accounting regulations. It includes tools for managing taxes,
fiscal positions, reporting, and a predefined chart of accounts tailored
to Ecuador\'s standards.

The Ecuadorian localization package provides the following key features
to ensure compliance with local fiscal and accounting regulations:

- `../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: a predefined structure aligned with the latest standards
  of Ecuador's *Superintendency of Companies*, organized into multiple
  categories and fully compatible with NIIF accounting
- `Products <localizations/ecuador/products>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Taxes <localizations/ecuador/taxes>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:
  pre-configured tax rates, including standard VAT, zero-rated, and
  exempt options
- `../accounting/taxes/fiscal_positions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}:
  automated tax adjustments based on customer or supplier registration
  status
- `Document types <localizations/ecuador/document types>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: classification of transactions like *customer invoices*
  and *vendor bills* using government-defined document types set by the
  SRI (Ecuador's tax authority)
- `Company and contacts <localizations/ecuador/company-contact>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Electronic documents <localizations/ecuador/electronic-documents>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `VAT withholding <localizations/ecuador/vat-withholding>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Printer points <localizations/ecuador/printer-points>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Withholding <localizations/ecuador/withholding>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Reporting <localizations/ecuador/reporting>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}

### Products {#localizations/ecuador/products}

If products have any
`withholding taxes <../accounting/taxes/retention>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, they must be configured on the product form. To do so, go
to `Accounting --> Vendors -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. On the
`General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, specify
both `Purchase Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Profit Withhold`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Taxes {#localizations/ecuador/taxes}

To manage taxes, navigate to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Depending on the tax type, the following options
may be required for additional configuration:

- `Tax Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Follows a specific
  format depending on the tax type:
  - | **For IVA (Value-Added Tax)**:
    | [IVA \[percent\] (104, \[form code\] \[tax support code\] \[tax
      support short name\])]{.title-ref}
    | Example: [IVA 12% (104, RUC \[tax support code\] IVA)]{.title-ref}

  - | **For Income Tax Withholding codes**:
    | [Code ATS \[percent of withhold\] \[withhold name\]]{.title-ref}
    | Example: [Code ATS 10% Retención a la Fuente]{.title-ref}
- `Tax Support`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Configure only for
  the IVA tax. This option is used to register purchase withholdings.
- `Code ATS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Configure only for
  income tax withholding codes, as it is necessary to register a
  withholding.

In the `Definition`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:

- `Tax Grids`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Configure the code of
  a 104 form if it is an IVA tax, and the code of a 103 form if it is an
  income tax withholding code.

### Document types {#localizations/ecuador/document types}

To access or configure document types, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Document Types`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Each document
type can have a unique sequence per journal where it is assigned. As
part of the localization, the document type includes the country where
the document is applicable; also, the data is created automatically when
the localization module is installed. The information required for the
document types is included by default and doesn\'t need to be changed.

### Company and contact {#localizations/ecuador/company-contact}

::: seealso
`Configure a company or individual contact <../../essentials/contacts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

The following fields should be completed for localization purposes on
the contact form:

::::

#### Purchase liquidation {#localizations/ecuador/purchase-liquidation}

*Purchase liquidations* are electronic documents sent to the SRI once
they\'re validated. Companies issue them when they make a purchase, but
the vendor does not provide an invoice due to one or more of the
following reasons:

- Non-residents of Ecuador provided services.
- Foreign companies provided services without residency or facility in
  Ecuador.
- Purchase of goods or services from natural persons not registered with
  a RUC, who cannot issue sales receipts or customer invoices.
- Reimbursement for purchasing goods or services must be given to
  employees in a dependency relationship (full-time employee).
- Members of collegiate bodies have provided services in the exercise of
  their function.

In these cases, a `purchase liquidation journal
<localizations/ecuador/purchase-liquidation-journal>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} must be created.

##### Create a purchase liquidation journal {#localizations/ecuador/purchase-liquidation-journal}

To create a *purchase liquidations* journal, enter the following
information:

- `Journal Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter this format:

  Select `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Once the `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, complete
the following fields:

- `Purchase Liquidations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick this
  checkbox to enable purchase liquidations.
- `Use Documents?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enable this
  option if legal invoicing (invoices, debit/credit notes) is used, as
  this is the standard configuration. If not, select the option to
  record accounting entries unrelated to legal invoicing documents, such
  as receipts, tax payments, or journal entries.
- `Emission Entity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  facility number.
- `Emission Point`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the printer
  point.
- `Emission address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  address of the facility.
- `Short Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a unique
  5-digit code for the accounting entry sequence (e.g.,
  [PT001]{.title-ref}).

Finally, in the `Advanced Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, check the `Electronic invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox to enable sending XML/EDI invoices.

##### Create a purchase liquidation {#localizations/ecuador/purchase-liquidation-creation}

Purchase liquidations, created from *purchase orders* or manually from
*vendor bills*, must contain the following data:

- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the vendor\'s
  information.
- `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  `Purchase Liquidation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} journal with
  the correct printer point.
- `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter this
  document type: [(03) Purchase Liquidation]{.title-ref}.
- `Document number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  document number (sequence). This must only be entered once, and the
  sequence will automatically be assigned to the subsequent documents.
- `Payment Method (SRI)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select how
  to pay the invoice.
- `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Specify the product
  with the correct taxes.

Then, validate the `Purchase Liquidation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

#### Purchase withholding {#localizations/ecuador/purchase-withholding}

*Purchase withholdings* are electronic documents sent to the SRI once
they\'re validated. They can only be registered from a validated
(posted) invoice.

On the invoice, click `Add Withhold`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and complete the following fields in the `Withhold`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} window:

- `Document number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  document number (sequence). This must only be entered once, and the
  sequence will automatically be assigned for the next documents.
- `Withhold lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The taxes appear
  automatically according to the configuration of products and vendors.
  Review if the taxes and tax support are correct. If not, edit and
  select the correct taxes and tax support.

Then, validate the `Withholding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Tax support types must be configured on the
`Vendor Bill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To do so, go to the
tax applied on the `Vendor Bill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
change the `Tax Support`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} there.
::::

A withholding tax can be divided into two or more lines, depending on
whether two or more withholding percentages apply.

::: example
Odoo suggests a VAT withholding of 30% with tax support 01. VAT
withholding of 70% can be added to a new line with the same tax support.
Odoo allows it if the base total matches the
`Vendor Bill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}\'s total.
:::

### Expense reimbursement {#localizations/ecuador/expense reimbursement}

Expense reimbursements apply to the following cases:

- `Individual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: reimbursement to an
  employee for miscellaneous expenses (e.g., purchase liquidations)
- `Legal Entity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: reimbursement for
  incurred expenses, such as representation expenses (e.g., hiring a
  lawyer)

To enable expense reimbursement, make sure a
`purchase liquidation journal
<localizations/ecuador/purchase-liquidation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} has been created for an individual or a `vendor
bills journal <localizations/ecuador/vendor-bill>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for a legal entity.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In the vendor bills journal, be sure the following necessary
configurations are set for a legal entity:

- Select `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as the
  `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- **Do not** tick the `Purchase Liquidations`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} checkbox.
- Add a `Default Expense Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

Next, to create a reimbursement,
`create a vendor bill <localizations/ecuador/vendor-bill>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} using the *purchase liquidation* or *vendor bills* journal.
On the vendor bill, configure the following fields:

- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field should be an
  employee.
- `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Verify that this
  field is accurately populated from the journal.
- `Payment Method (SRI)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select a
  payment method.
- `Reimbursement Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab: Click
  `Auto Fill Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
  automatically populate the invoice lines or add the expenses line by

### Electronic delivery guide {#localizations/ecuador/electronic-delivery-guide}

An *Electronic Delivery Guide* in Ecuador is a legal document that
supports the transportation of goods or merchandise from one place to
another within the national territory. It is issued by the sender of the
goods and aims to record and justify the movement of products to avoid
legal or tax issues. It is a fiscal requirement mandated by the
*Internal Revenue Service (SRI)*.

## eCommerce {#localizations/ecuador/ecommerce}

The `ATS Report module <localizations/ecuador/ats>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} enables the following:

- Choose the *SRI Payment Method* for each payment method\'s
  configuration.
- Customers can manually input their identification type and number
  during eCommerce checkout.
- Automatically generate a valid electronic invoice for Ecuador at the
  end of the checkout process.

::: seealso
`eCommerce documentation <../../websites/ecommerce>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

### Online payments {#localizations/ecuador/online-payments}

To enable online payments, add the relevant
`payment provider(s) <../payment_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and configure the necessary
`payment methods <payment_providers/payment_methods>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. It is mandatory to set the
`SRI Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for each method.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Adding the `SRI Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
necessary to correctly generate the electronic invoice from an eCommerce
sale. Select a **payment method** to access its configuration menu and
field.
::::

### Automatic invoice {#localizations/ecuador/automatic-invoice}

`Invoices <ecommerce/handling/invoices>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
can be generated after the checkout process.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The invoice\'s email template can be modified from the
`Invoice Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field under
the `Automatic Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The sales journal used for invoicing is the first in the priority
sequence in the `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu.
::::

### Identification type and number {#localizations/ecuador/ecommerce-workflow}

During the checkout process, the client making a purchase will have the
option to indicate their identification type and number. This
information is required to generate the electronic invoice after the
checkout is completed correctly.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Verification is done to ensure the
`Identification Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
completed and has the correct number of digits. For RUC identification,
13 digits are required, and for Cédula, 9 digits are required.
::::

After finishing the checkout process, a confirmed invoice is generated,
ready to be sent manually or asynchronously to the SRI.

## Point of sale electronic invoicing {#localizations/ecuador/point-of-sale}

Make sure the *Ecuadorian module for Point of Sale*
([l10n_ec_edi_pos]{.title-ref}) is `installed
<localizations/ecuador/module-installation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to enable the following features and configurations:

- Choose the SRI payment method in each payment method configuration.
- Manually input the customer\'s identification type and number when
  creating a new contact on *POS*.
- Automatically generate a valid electronic invoice for Ecuador at the
  end of the checkout process.

### Payment method configuration {#localizations/ecuador/payment-method-configuration}

To
`create a payment method for a point of sale <../../sales/point_of_sale/payment_methods>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, go to
`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Payment Methods`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, set the
`SRI Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the payment
method form.

### Invoicing flows {#localizations/ecuador/invoicing-flow}

#### Identification type and number {#localizations/ecuador/identification-type-number}

The P0S cashier can
`create a new contact for a customer <pos/customers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} who requests an invoice from an open POS session.

The *Ecuadorian Module for Point of Sale* adds two new fields to the
contact creation form: `Identification Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

As the identification number length differs depending on the
identification type, Odoo automatically checks the
`Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field when saving the
contact form. To manually ensure the length is correct, know that the
`RUC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Citizenship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} types require 13 and 10
digits, respectively.
::::

#### Electronic invoice: anonymous end consumer {#localizations/ecuador/anonymous-end-consumer}

When clients do not request an electronic invoice for their purchase,
Odoo automatically sets the customer as
`Consumidor Final`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and generates an
electronic invoice anyway.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the client requests a credit note due to a return of this type of
purchase, the credit note should be made using the client\'s real
contact information. Credit notes cannot be created for *Consumidor
Final* and can be managed
`directly from the POS session <pos/refund>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

#### Electronic invoice: specific customer {#localizations/ecuador/specific-customer}

If a customer requests an invoice for their purchase, it is possible to
select or create a contact with their fiscal information. This ensures
the invoice is generated with accurate customer details.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the client requests a credit note due to a return of this type of
purchase, the credit note and return process can be managed
`directly from the POS session <pos/refund>`{.interpreted-text

#### ETA codes {#egypt/e-invoicing-eta-codes}

E-invoicing works with a set of codes provided by the ETA. You can use
the [ETA documentation](https://sdk.preprod.invoicing.eta.gov.eg/codes/)
to code your business attributes.

Most of these codes are handled automatically by Odoo, provided that
your `branches
<egypt/e-invoicing-branches>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`customers <egypt/e-invoicing-customers>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
and `products
<egypt/e-invoicing-products>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are
correctly configured.

- Company Information:
  - Company Tax ID

  - | Branch ID
    | If you have only one branch, use `0` as the branch code.

  - Activity type Code
- Other Information:
  - | Product Codes
    | Your company\'s products should be coded and matched with their
      **GS1** or **EGS** codes.

  - | Tax Codes
    | Most of the taxes codes are already configured on Odoo in the
      `ETA Code (Egypt)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. We
      advise you to make sure these codes match your company\'s taxes.

## Localization overview {#localizations/france/loc-overview}

The French localization package ensures compliance with French fiscal
and accounting regulations. It includes tools for managing taxes, fiscal
positions, reporting, and a predefined chart of accounts tailored to
France's standards.

The French localization package provides the following key features to
ensure compliance with local fiscal and accounting regulations:

- `../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: a predefined structure tailored to French accounting
  standards
- `../accounting/taxes/fiscal_positions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}:
  automated tax adjustments based on customer or supplier registration
  status
- `Taxes <../accounting/taxes>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}:
  pre-configured tax rates, including standard VAT, zero-rated, and
  exempt options
- `Payroll </applications/hr/payroll>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
- `Reporting <localizations/france/reporting>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}

### Reporting {#localizations/france/reporting}

`Installing </applications/general/apps_modules>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} the `France - Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
([l10n_fr_account]{.title-ref}) module gives access to some accounting
reports specific to France, such as:

- `Bilan comptable (FR)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  (`Balance Sheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"})
- `Compte de résultats (FR)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  (`Profit and Loss`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"})
- `Rapport de taxes (FR)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  (`Tax Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"})

## Accounting {#localizations/france/accounting}

### E-Invoicing {#localizations/france/e-invoicing}

The [Chorus Pro](https://portail.chorus-pro.gouv.fr/aife_csm) portal,
managed by the AIFE (Agence pour l\'Informatique financière de l\'État),
is the official platform for submitting electronic invoices to French
public entities. It allows businesses to send and manage invoices, track
their processing status, and access payment updates. Since January 2020,
electronic invoicing has been mandatory for all business-to-government
(B2G) transactions in France. Odoo supports integration with Chorus Pro
to submit invoices generated in Odoo.

#### Configuration {#localizations/france/e-invoicing-configuration}

To send invoices to Chorus Pro, the following configuration is required:

1.  `Install </applications/general/apps_modules>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} the `France - Factur-X integration
    with Chorus Pro`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    ([l10n_fr_facturx_chorus_pro]{.title-ref}) module.
2.  `Register <accounting/e-invoicing/peppol-registration>`{.interpreted-text

### FEC - Fichier des Écritures Comptables {#localizations/france/fec}

An FEC `Fichier des Écritures Comptables`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}
audit file contains all the accounting data and entries recorded in all
the accounting journals for a financial year. The entries in the file
must be arranged in chronological order. Since January 2014, every
French company is required to produce and transmit this file upon
request by the tax authorities for audit purposes.

#### FEC Import {#localizations/france/fec-import}

`Install </applications/general/apps_modules>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} the `France - FEC Import`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
([l10n_fr_fec_import]{.title-ref}) module to import FEC files from other
software.

To enable this feature, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. In the `Accounting Import`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, click `oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Import`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Import FEC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, in the
`FEC Import`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window, upload the FEC
file and click `Import`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Importing FEC files from different years requires no particular actions
or computations. However, if multiple files contain RAN
`Reports à Nouveaux`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"} with the starting
balance for the year, these entries are automatically marked as
unnecessary in Odoo and may need to be deleted.
::::

##### File formats {#localizations/france/fec-file-formats}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- FEC files must be in CSV format, as XML format is not supported. -
The FEC CSV file is a plain text file structured as a data table. The
first line serves as the header, defining the list of fields for each
entry, and each following line represents a single accounting entry
without any specific order.
::::

FEC files must comply with the following technical specifications:

- **Encoding**: UTF-8, UTF-8-SIG and iso8859_15.
- **Separator**: any of these: [;]{.title-ref} or [\|]{.title-ref} or
  [,]{.title-ref} or [TAB]{.title-ref}.
- **Line terminators**: both CR+LF ([rn]{.title-ref}) and LF
  ([n]{.title-ref}) character groups are supported.
- **Date format**: [%Y%m%d]{.title-ref}

##### Implementation details {#localizations/france/fec-implementation}

The following accounting entities are imported from the FEC files:
**Accounts, Journals, Partners**, and **Moves**. The module
automatically determines the encoding, line terminator, and separator
used in the file. Next, a check is performed to ensure that each line
has the correct number of fields matching the header. If the check is
successful, the entire file is read, stored in memory, and scanned.
Accounting entities are then imported one type at a time in the
following order.

###### Accounts {#localizations/france/fec-accounts}

Each accounting entry is associated with an account identified by the
`CompteNum`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

###### Code matching {#localizations/france/fec-code-matching}

If an account with the same code already exists, the existing one is
used rather than creating a new one. In Odoo, account numbers follow the
default digit length of the fiscal localization. Since the FEC module is
tied to the French localization, the default account length is 6 digits.
This means that trailing zeros in account codes are removed, and the
comparison between the account codes in the FEC file and those already
in Odoo is made based only on the first six digits of the codes.

::: example
The account code [65800000]{.title-ref} in the file is matched with an
existing [658000]{.title-ref} account in Odoo, and the existing account
is used instead of creating a new one.
:::

###### Reconcilable flag {#localizations/france/fec-reconcilable-flag}

An account is technically flagged as *reconcilable* if the first line in
which it appears has the `EcritureLet`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field filled out, indicating that the accounting entry
will be reconciled with another one.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The field can be left empty on the line, but the entry must still be
reconciled with an unrecorded payment. The account is flagged as
reconcilable once the import of the move lines requires it.
::::

###### Account type and templates matching {#localizations/france/fec-account-type}

Since the account **type** is not specified in the FEC format, **new**
accounts are created with the default type
`Current Assets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. After the import
process, they are matched against the installed Chart of Account
templates. The *reconcile* flag is also determined this way.

The matching is performed by comparing the left-most digits, starting
with all digits, followed by 3 digits, and then 2 digits.

::: example
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Name         Code                     Full comparison          3-digits comparison 2-digits
                                                                                     comparison
  ------------ ------------------------ ------------------------ ------------------- ------------------
  Template     [400000]{.title-ref}     [400000]{.title-ref}     [400]{.title-ref}   [40]{.title-ref}

  CompteNum    [40100000]{.title-ref}   [40100000]{.title-ref}   [401]{.title-ref}   [40]{.title-ref}

  **Result**                                                                         Match **found**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

The account type is then flagged as `payable`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `reconcilable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
based on the account template.

###### Journals {#localizations/france/fec-journals}

Journals are checked against the existing ones in Odoo to avoid
duplicates, even when importing multiple FEC files.

If a journal with the same code already exists, the existing journal is
used instead of creating a new one.

New journals have the prefix `FEC-`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
added to their name. For example, `ACHATS`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} becomes `FEC-ACHATS`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Journals are *not* archived, allowing the user to manage them as
desired.
::::

###### Journal type determination {#localizations/france/fec-journal-type}

The journal type is not specified in the format (similar to the
accounts) and is initially created with the default type
`general`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

At the end of the import process, the journal type is determined based
on the following rules regarding related moves and accounts:

- | `bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Moves in these journals
    always include a line (debit or credit) impacting a liquidity
    account.
  | `cash`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} / `bank`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} can be interchanged, so `bank`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} is assigned when this condition is met.

- | `sale`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Moves in these journals
    mostly have debit lines on receivable accounts and credit lines on
    tax income accounts.
  | Sale refund journal items are debit/credit inverted.

- | `purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Moves in these
    journals mostly have credit lines on payable accounts and debit
    lines on expense accounts.
  | Purchase refund journal items are debit/credit inverted.

- | `general`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Used for everything
    else.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- A minimum of three moves is required to identify the journal type. -
A threshold of 70% of the moves must meet the criteria for a journal
type to be determined.
::::

::: example
Suppose we are analyzing the moves that share a certain
`journal_id`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Moves                                                Count   Percentage
  ---------------------------------------------------- ------- ------------
  that have a sale account line and no purchase        0       0
  account line                                                 

  that have a purchase account line and no sale        1       25%
  account line                                                 

  that have a liquidity account line                   3       **75%**

  **Total**                                            4       100%
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

The journal `type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} would be
`bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, because the bank\'s move
percentage (75%) exceeds the threshold (70%).
:::

###### Contacts {#localizations/france/fec-partners}

Each contact keeps its `Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
from the `CompAuxNum`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

These fields are searchable based on previous FEC imports for
fiscal/audit purposes.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Similar and potential duplicate contacts can be merged using the Data
Cleaning App.
::::

###### Moves {#localizations/france/fec-moves}

Entries are posted and reconciled immediately upon submission, with the
`EcritureLet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field used to match the
entries.

The `EcritureNum`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field represents
the name of the moves, but it may sometimes be left empty. In such
cases, the `PieceRef`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is used
instead.

###### Rounding issues {#localizations/france/fec-rounding-issue}

A rounding tolerance is applied based on currency precision for debit
and credit amounts (i.e., 0.01 for EUR). If the difference falls under
this tolerance, a new line is added to the move, called
`Import rounding difference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
targeting the following accounts:

- [658000]{.title-ref} Charges diverses de gestion courante, for added
  debits
- [758000]{.title-ref} Produits divers de gestion courante, for added
  credits

###### Missing move name {#localizations/france/fec-missing-move-name}

If the the `EcritureNum`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is not
filled out and `PieceRef`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
not suited to determine the move name (it may be used as an accounting
move line reference), it becomes impossible to identify which lines
should be grouped into a single move, and effectively preventing the
creation of balanced moves.

In such cases, a final attempt is made to group all lines by the same
journal and date (`JournalLib`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`EcritureDate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}). If this grouping
generates balanced moves (sum(credit) - sum(debit) = 0), then each
different combination of journal and date creates a new move.

::: example
[ACH]{.title-ref} + [2021/05/01]{.title-ref} \--\> new move on journal
[ACH]{.title-ref} with name [20210501]{.title-ref}.
:::

If this attempt fails, an error message is displayed, listing all the
move lines that are considered unbalanced.

###### Contact information {#localizations/france/fec-partner-information}

If a line includes contact information, it is copied to the accounting
move itself, provided the targeted journal is of type
`payable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`receivable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

#### FEC Export {#localizations/france/fec-export}

To download the FEC, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> General Ledger`{.interpreted-text

### Liasse fiscale {#localization/france/liasse-fiscale}

The *liasse fiscale* (tax returns) is a collection of standardized
financial documents that businesses must submit annually to the tax
authorities. It comprehensively summarizes the company's financial
activities and determines corporate taxes.

[Teledec](https://www.teledec.fr) is a platform used to prepare and
submit tax returns using data from accounting records. To synchronize
your accounting data stored in Odoo with Teledec and electronically send
your company\'s *liasse fiscale* to the DGFiP (Direction Générale des
Finances Publiques), follow these steps:

1.  `localization/france/teledec-account`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

### VAT anti-fraud certification {#localizations/france/vat-anti-fraud-certification}

Since January 2018, new anti-fraud legislation has been in effect in
France and its overseas territories (DOM-TOM). This legislation
establishes specific requirements for the integrity, security, storage,
and archiving of sales data. Odoo complies with these legal requirements
by providing a module and a downloadable certificate of conformity.

Anti-fraud cash register software, such as Odoo (CGI art. 286, I. 3°
bis), is required for companies taxable in France or DOM-TOM, where some
customers are private individuals (B2C). This rule applies to all
company sizes, but auto-entrepreneurs exempt from VAT are unaffected.

:::

#### Odoo certification {#localizations/france/pos-odoo-certification}

The tax administration requires all companies to provide a certificate
of conformity confirming that their software complies with anti-fraud
legislation. In case of non-compliance, a €7,500 fine may be imposed.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This
[certificate](https://www.odoo.com/my/contract/french-certification/) is
granted by Odoo SA to Odoo Enterprise users.
::::

To get the certification, follow these steps:

1.  `Install </applications/general/apps_modules>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} the `France - VAT Anti-Fraud
    Certification for Point of Sale (CGI 286 I-3 bis)`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} ([l10n_fr_pos_cert]{.title-ref}) module.
2.  Set the `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the
    `company record </applications/general/companies>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} to encrypt entries for the inalterability check.
3.  Download the mandatory [certificate of
    conformity](https://www.odoo.com/my/contract/french-certification/)
    delivered by Odoo SA.

#### Anti-fraud features {#localizations/france/pos-anti-fraud-features}

The anti-fraud module introduces the following features:

- `Inalterability <localizations/france/pos-inalterability>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Security <localizations/france/pos-security>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Storage <localizations/france/pos-storage>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}

##### Inalterability {#localizations/france/pos-inalterability}

All methods to cancel or modify key data in POS orders, invoices, and
journal entries are deactivated for companies located in France or any
DOM-TOM.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In a multi-company environment, only the documents of such companies are
impacted.
::::

##### Security {#localizations/france/pos-security}

To ensure inalterability, every order or journal entry is encrypted upon
validation. This number (or hash) is calculated from the document\'s key
data and the hash of the precedent documents. The module introduces an
interface to test the data\'s inalterability. The test will fail if any
information is modified on a document after its validation. The
algorithm recomputes all the hashes and compares them against the
initial ones. In case of failure, the system points out the first
corrupted document recorded in the system.

Only users with
`administrator </applications/general/users/access_rights>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} access rights can initiate the inalterability check:

- For POS orders, go to
  `Point of Sales --> Reporting --> POS Inalterability Check`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"};
- For journal entries, go to
  `Invoicing/Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}. In the `Reporting`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} section, click
  `Download the Data Inalterability Check
  Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

##### Storage {#localizations/france/pos-storage}

The system also processes automatic sales closings daily, monthly, and
annually. Such closings compute the sales total for the period and the
cumulative grand totals from the very first sales entry recorded in the
system.

To access closings, either go to
`Point of Sales --> Reporting --> Sales Closings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} or
`Invoicing/Accounting --> Reporting --> Sales Closings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Closings compute the totals for journal entries of sales journals
(Journal Type = Sales). - For multi-companies environments, such
closings are performed by company. - POS orders are posted as journal
entries at the closing of the POS session. Closing a POS session can be
done anytime. To prompt users to do it daily, the module prevents them
from resuming a session that was opened more than 24 hours ago. Such a
session must be closed before selling again. - A period's total is
computed from all the journal entries posted after the previous closing
of the same type, regardless of their posting date. Recording a new
sales transaction for a period already closed will be counted in the
very next closing.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

For test & audit purposes, closings can be manually generated in
`developer mode
<developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. To do so, go to
`Settings --> Technical --> Scheduled Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. In the scheduled actions list view, open the
desired `Sale Closing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} action and
click `Run manually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

#### Responsibilities {#localizations/france/pos-responsibilities}

Uninstalling this module will reset the security hashes. This means the
system will no longer guarantee the integrity of the past data.

Users are responsible for their Odoo system and must operate it
carefully. Modifying source code responsible for ensuring data integrity
is not allowed.

Odoo is not responsible for any issues with this module\'s functionality
if caused by uncertified third-party applications.

## Accounting

### Chart of accounts

Both SKR03 and SKR04 charts of accounts are supported in Odoo. When you
create a new Odoo Online database, SKR03 is installed by default.

Verify which is installed by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and checking the `Package`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field under the `Fiscal Localization`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Selecting another package is only possible if you have not created an
accounting entry. If one was posted, a new company or database must be
set up to select another package. In addition, all journal entries will
need to be created again.
::::

### Reports

The following German-specific reports available on Odoo Enterprise:

- Balance Sheet
- Profit & Loss
- Tax Report (Umsatzsteuervoranmeldung)
- EC Sales List
- Intrastat

### Exporting entries from Odoo to DATEV

Provided that one of the German `fiscal localization packages
<fiscal_localizations/packages>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is
installed, you can export your accounting entries from Odoo to DATEV
from the general ledger.

Two types of exports are needed: first the DATEV ATCH export, then the
DATEV DATA export.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Both are needed at different stages to transfer the data correctly to
DATEV, as DATEV works with two interfaces, one for clients (DUO - DATEV
Unternehmen Online) and one for tax advisors (DATEV Rechnungswesen).
::::

#### 1. DATEV ATCH

Go to `Accounting --> Reporting --> General Ledger`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
(`Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) button, and select
`Datev ATCH (zip)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![General ledger\'s actions menu with DATEV exports](germany/datev-export.png)

Upload the downloaded ZIP file via the [DATEV Belegtransfer
software](https://www.datev.de/web/de/service-und-support/software-bereitstellung/download-bereich/betriebliches-rechnungswesen/belegtransfer).

If you do not have the DATEV Belegtransfer software installed on your
computer, ask your tax advisor to help you with this.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

The DATEV ATCH ZIP file includes the files (reports) linked to an Odoo
invoice or bill. For customer invoices, the file must have been
generated by using the `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.
For vendor bills, the file must have been received via an email alias or
uploaded by using the `Upload`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button.
::::

::: admonition
DATEV ATCH ZIP file

The ZIP file contains two types of files:

- the individual invoice/bill files (PDF, JPEG, etc.) for the selected
  period on the general ledger, and
- a `document.xml`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file used to generate
  a unique ID (GUID) for each file.

These unique IDs are essential as they allow DATEV to automatically link
the files to the individual journal items, which will be imported with
the DATEV DATA file in the next step.
:::

#### 2. DATEV DATA

Go to `Accounting --> Reporting --> General Ledger`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
(`Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) button, and select
`Datev DATA (zip)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Transfer the downloaded ZIP file to your tax advisor. They should import
the ZIP file into DATEV Rechnungswesen.

Check with your tax advisor how often they need these files.

::: admonition
DATEV ATCH ZIP file

The ZIP file contains three CSV files:

- the `EXTF_customer_accounts.csv`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file
  containing all information related to your customers,
- the `EXTF_vendor_accounts.csv`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file
  containing all information related to your vendors, and
- the `EXTF_accounting_entries.csv`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
  containing all journal items for the period defined on the general
  ledger, as well as the unique IDs (GUID) so that the journal items can
  be linked to the files inside the DATEV ATCH ZIP file.

### GoBD compliance {#germany/gobd}

**GoBD** stands for *Grundsätze zur ordnungsmäßigen Führung und
Aufbewahrung von Büchern, Aufzeichnungen und Unterlagen in
elektronischer Form sowie zum Datenzugriff*. In short, it is a guideline
for the proper management and storage of books, records, and documents
in electronic form, as well as for data access, that is relevant for the
German tax authority, tax declaration, and balance sheet.

These principles have been written and published by the Federal Ministry
of Finance (BMF) in November 2014. Since January 2015, **they have
become the norm** and have replaced previously accepted practices linked
to computer-based accounting. Several changes have been made by the BMF
in 2019 and January 2020 to specify some of the content due to the
development of digital solutions (cloud hosting, paperless companies,
etc.).

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo is certified **GoBD-compliant**.
::::

#### Understanding GoBD in relation to accounting software

The **GoBD is binding for companies that have to present accounts**,
which includes SMEs, freelancers, and entrepreneurs, to the financial
authorities. As such, **the taxpayer himself is the sole responsible**
for the complete and exhaustive keeping of fiscal-relevant data
(above-mentioned financial and related data).

Apart from software requirements, the user is required to ensure
internal control systems (*in accordance with sec. 146 of the Fiscal
Code*):

- access rights control;
- segregation of duties, functional separating;
- entry controls (error notifications, plausibility checks);
- reconciliation checks at data entry;
- processing controls; and
- measures to prevent intentional or unintentional manipulation of
  software, data, or documents.

The user must distribute tasks within their organization to the relevant
positions (*control*) and verify that the tasks are properly and
completely performed (*supervision*). The result of these controls must
be recorded (*documentation*), and should errors be found during these
controls, appropriate measures to correct the situation should be put
into place (*prevention*).

#### Data security

The taxpayer must **secure the system against any data loss** due to
deletion, removal, or theft of any data. If the entries are not
sufficiently secured, the bookkeeping will be regarded as not in
accordance with the GoBD guidelines.

Once bookings have been finally posted, they can no longer be changed or
deleted via the application.

- If Odoo is used in the cloud, regular backups are part of the Odoo
  Online service. In addition, regular backups can be downloaded and
  backed up on external systems.

  ::: seealso
  [Odoo Cloud Hosting - Service Level
  Agreement](https://www.odooo.com/cloud-sla)
  :::

- If the server is operated locally, the user is responsible for
  creating the necessary backup infrastructure.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

In some cases, data has to be kept for ten years or more, so always have
backups saved. It is even more important if you decide to change
software provider.
::::

#### Responsibility of the software editor

Considering GoBD applies only to the taxpayer, **the software editor can
by no means be held responsible for the accurate and compliant
documentation of their users\' financial transactional data**. It can
merely provide the necessary tools for the user to respect the
software-related guidelines described in the GoBD.

#### Ensuring compliance through Odoo

The keywords, when it comes to GoBD are: **traceable, verifiable, true,
clear, and continuous**. In short, you need to have audit-proof
archiving in place, and Odoo provides you with the means to achieve all
of these objectives:

1.  | **Traceability and verifiability**
    | Each record in Odoo is stamped with the creator of the document,
      the creation date, the modification date, and who modified it. In
      addition, relevant fields are tracked. Thus, it can be seen which
      value was changed by whom in the chatter of the relevant object.

2.  | **Completeness**
    | All financial data must be recorded in the system, and there can
      be no gaps. Odoo ensures that there is no gap in the numbering of
      the financial transactions. It is the responsibility of the user
      to encode all financial data in the system. As most financial data
      in Odoo is generated automatically, it remains the responsibility
      of the user to encode all vendor bills and miscellaneous
      operations completely.

3.  | **Accuracy**
    | Odoo ensures that, with the correct configuration, the correct
      accounts are used. In addition, the control mechanisms between
      purchase orders and sales orders and their respective invoices
      reflect the reality of the business. It is the responsibility of
      the user to scan and attach the paper-based vendor bill to the
      respective record in Odoo. *Odoo Documents helps you automate this
      task*.

4.  | **Timely booking and record-keeping**
    | As most financial data in Odoo is generated by the transactional
      objects (for example, the invoice is booked at confirmation), Odoo
      ensures out-of-the-box timely record-keeping. It is the
      responsibility of the user to encode all incoming vendor bills in
      a timely manner, as well as the miscellaneous operations.

5.  | **Order**
    | Financial data stored in Odoo is, per definition, ordered and can
      be reordered according to most fields present in the model. A
      specific ordering is not enforced by the GoBD, but the system must
      ensure that a given financial transaction can be quickly found by
      a third-party expert. Odoo ensures this out-of-the-box.

6.  | **Inalterability**
    | With the German Odoo localization, Odoo is in standard configured
      in such a way that the inalterability clause can be adhered to
      without any further customization.

#### GoBD export

In the case of fiscal control, the fiscal authority can request three
levels of access to the accounting system (Z1, Z2, Z3). These levels
vary from direct access to the interface to the handover of the
financial data on a storage device.

In the case of a handover of financial data to a storage device, the
GoBD does **not** enforce the format. It can be, for example, in XLS,
CSV, XML, Lotus 123, SAP-format, AS/400-format, or else. Odoo supports
the CSV and XLS export of financial data out of the box. The GoBD
**recommends** the export in a specific XML-based GoBD format (see
\"Ergänzende Informationen zur Datenträgerüberlassung\" §3), but it is
not binding.

#### Non-compliance

In the event of an infringement, you can expect a fine and a court order
demanding the implementation of specific measures.

## Point of Sale {#germany/pos}

### Technical security system

The **Kassensicherungsverordnung** (The Act on Protection against
Manipulation of Digital Records) requires that electronic record-keeping
systems - including the `point of sale
</applications/sales/point_of_sale>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
systems - must be equipped with a **technical security system** (also
called **TSS** or **TSE**).

Odoo offers a service that is compliant with the help of
[fiskaly](https://fiskaly.com), a *cloud-based solution*.

:::: important

##### Create a technical security system and link it to a POS

To use a point of sale in Germany, first create a
`TSS (Technical Security System)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by
going to
`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Point of Sale`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, selecting the `Point of Sale`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to edit, then checking the
`Create TSS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box under the
`Fiskaly API`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

Once the creation of the TSS is successful, you can find the:

- `TSS ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which refers to the ID of
  your TSS on fiskaly\'s side, and
- `Fiskaly Client ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which refers
  to your POS on fiskaly\'s side.

![Fiskaly API section](germany/fiskaly-tss.png)

#### DSFinV-K export

Whenever you close a PoS session, the details of the orders are sent to
the `DSFinV-K
(Digitale Schnittstelle der Finanzverwaltung für Kassensysteme)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} service of fiskaly.

In case of an audit, you can export the data sent to DSFinV-K by going
to `Point of
Sale --> Orders --> DSFinV-K Exports --> New`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![Menu to export DSFinV-K](germany/pos-orders-menu.png)

These fields are mandatory:

- `Start Datetime`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: export data with

### Electronic invoicing credentials

In Guatemala, electronic invoicing is mandatory for most businesses.
Odoo connects with the authorized provider, Infile, to generate and
submit electronic documents to the
`SAT (Superintendencia de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} for validation.

Before issuing electronic documents, you must configure and connect Odoo
to Infile to ensure they are properly validated and assigned an official
`UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

#### Infile

Sign a service agreement directly with [Infile](https://infile.com.gt/).
Infile will then provide the necessary credentials to input in Odoo.

:::: note

#### Management of negative lines in e-Invoices {#india/e-invoice-negative-lines}

Negative lines are typically used to represent discounts or adjustments
associated with specific products or global discounts. The government
portal prohibits the submission of data with negative lines, which means
they need to be converted based on the HSN code and GST rate. This is
done automatically by Odoo.

::: example
Consider the following example:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > **Product Details**                                                                |
+===============+=============+=============+==============+=============+=============+
| **Product     | **HSN       | **Tax       | **Quantity** | **GST       | **Total**   |
| Name**        | Code**      | Excluded**  |              | Rate**      |             |
+---------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Product A     | > 123456    | > 1,000     | > 1          | > 18%       | > 1,180     |
+---------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Product B     | > 239345    | > 1,500     | > 2          | > 5%        | > 3,150     |
+---------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Discount on   | > 123456    | > -100      | > 1          | > 18%       | > -118      |
| Product A     |             |             |              |             |             |
+---------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+

Here\'s the transformed representation:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > **Product Details**                                                                             |
+=============+=============+=============+==============+==============+=============+=============+
| **Product   | **HSN       | **Tax       | **Quantity** | **Discount** | **GST       | **Total**   |
| Name**      | Code**      | Excluded**  |              |              | Rate**      |             |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Product A   | > 123456    | > 1,000     | > 1          | > 100        | > 18%       | > 1,062     |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Product B   | > 239345    | > 1,500     | > 2          | > 0          | > 5%        | > 3,150     |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+

In this conversion, negative lines have been transformed into positive
discounts, maintaining accurate calculations based on the HSN Code and
GST rate. This ensures a more straightforward and standardized
representation in the E-invoice records.

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    The following types of validation issues can be raised:

    - `Apply Appropriate Tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
      `IGST`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is not applicable for
      intra-state transactions.
    - `Wrong CGST/SGST on Inter-State Transactions`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"}: `CGST/SGST`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
      cannot be applied on inter-state transactions.
    - `Fiscal Year Reversed Move`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
      Credit Notes for invoices issued in a given financial year should
      not be included in GSTR-1 after **November 30th**; remove tax from
      these lines.
    - `Invalid HSN Codes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
      - For products (non-services), HSN codes must not begin with
        [99]{.title-ref}.
      - For services, HSN codes must begin with [99]{.title-ref}.
    - `Missing HSN Codes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Some
      product lines do not have HSN codes for journal items.
    - `Invalid UQC Codes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The Unit
      Quantity Code (UQC) must comply with Indian GST standards.
    - `Missing Document Summary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
      Document summary lines are mandatory for GSTR-1. This check is
      always marked as `Anomaly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
      initially. After reviewing the summary by clicking the relevant
      check, it changes to `Reviewed`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"}.
    - `Missing E-Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Some
      invoices are not linked to an e-invoice.
    - `Unlinked Unregistered Credit Notes`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"}: Credit Notes have been issued without
      referencing an invoice.
    ::::

    Validation checks have four stages:

    - `To Review`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Check requires
      review.
    - `Reviewed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Check has been
      reviewed.
    - `Supervised`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Check is
      supervised, and a supervisor is assigned.

## TDS/TCS threshold alert {#india/tds-tcs-threshold}

`TDS (tax deducted at source)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
`TCS (tax collected at source)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are tax
provisions under Indian law, triggered when transaction amounts exceed
specified thresholds. This alert notifies users when the value of
invoices or bills surpasses these limits, prompting the application of
the appropriate TDS/TCS.

To configure Odoo to advise you on when to apply TDS/TCS, set the
`TDS/TCS section`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the
corresponding account in the chart of accounts. Odoo will display a
banner suggesting the TDS/TCS section under which tax might be
applicable when recording an invoice or bill.

### Configuration

1.  Navigate to
    `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}

### Applying TCS/TDS on invoices and bills

Based on the account used on the customer invoice or vendor bill, Odoo
checks the TCS/TDS threshold limit. If the limit specified in the
`TCS/TDS Section`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the account is
exceeded, Odoo displays an alert that suggests applying the appropriate
TCS/TDS. The alert will disappear once the TCS/TDS is applied.

![TCS advice](india/tcs-warning.png)

**TCS** is directly applicable in the tax on the invoice lines. To apply
**TDS**, click the `TDS Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button on the vendor bill/payment. The popup window allows specifying
the TDS details. Confirm the entry to apply the TDS.

![TDS application](india/tds-apply.png)

In Odoo, the aggregate total is calculated for partners sharing the same
PAN number, across all company branches.

### Company information

Configuring the company\'s information ensures your Accounting database
is properly set up. To add information, go to
`Settings --> General Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and in the `Companies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, click
`Update info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. From here, fill out
the fields:

- `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the address of the
  company;
- `VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: VAT of the company;
- `Codice Fiscale`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the fiscal code
  of the company;
- `Tax System`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the tax system under
  which the company falls;

![Company information to be provided](italy/company.png)

### Taxes configuration

Many of the e-invoicing features are implemented using Odoo\'s tax
system. As such, taxes must be properly configured to generate invoices
correctly and handle other billing use cases.

The **Italian** localization contains predefined **examples** of taxes
for various purposes.

#### Tax exemption {#italy/tax-exemption}

The use of sale taxes that amount to **zero percent** (0%) is required
by Italian authorities to keep track of the exact
`Tax Exemption Kind (Natura)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Law Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that justify the
exemption operated on an invoice line.

::: example
The export tax in the EU can be used as reference ([0% EU]{.title-ref},
invoice label [00eu]{.title-ref}). It can be found under
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Exports are exempt from VAT, and therefore, they
require `Exoneration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} kind and
`Law Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filled in.
:::

![Tax Exemption Settings](italy/tax-exemption.png)

::: seealso
There are many `Tax Exemption Kind (Natura)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Law Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
codes. Make sure you check the latest version available to get the
latest information on:

- [Italian authorities
  documentation](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/web/guest/aree-tematiche/fatturazione-elettronica)
- [Official guide on Tax
  exemption](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/documents/20143/451259/Guida_compilazione-FE-Esterometro-V_1.9_2024-03-05.pdf/67fe4c2d-1174-e8de-f1ee-cea77b7f5203)
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If you need to use a different kind of exoneration, go to
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select
a similar tax, then click on the cog icon and select
`Duplicate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In the
`Advanced Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, add the
`Exoneration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Law Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To confirm click on
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

**Rename** your taxes in the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field according to their `Exoneration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to differentiate them easily.
::::

## Reverse charge {#italy/reverse-charge}

The **reverse charge** mechanism is a VAT rule that shifts the liability
to pay VAT from the supplier to the customer. The customers pay the VAT
*themselves* to the `AdE (Agenzia delle
Entrate)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} instead. There are different
types:

- | `Internal Reverse Charge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (for
    domestic sales)
  | The VAT responsibility is shifted to the buyer for certain
    categories of products and services.

- | `External Reverse Charge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (for
    intra-EU sales)
  | VAT is due in the country of the delivery or in the country where
    the service is performed. When the buyer is itself an Italian
    business, then the EU offers a mechanism that allows the seller to
    transfer his responsibility to the buyer.

### Invoices

**Reverse-charged** customer invoices show no VAT amount, but the
`AdE (Agenzia delle
Entrate)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} requires the seller to specify
the `Tax Exemption`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} reason and the
`Law
Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that enable the
reverse-charge mechanism. Odoo provides a set of special 0% taxes that
can be assigned to each reverse-charged invoice lines, representing the
most commonly used configurations.

### Vendor bills

Italian companies subjected to Reverse Charge must send the information
in the bill received to the
`AdE (Agenzia delle Entrate)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Self-reported VAT XML files must be issued and sent to the
`AdE (Agenzia Delle Entrate)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for reverse
charged bills.
::::

When creating a vendor bill, **reverse charge** taxes are available to
be added in the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. You
can check which taxes are available by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, you can see that the 10% Goods and 22% Services
taxes are activated, among others. Due to the automated configuration of
the Italian fiscal position, these are automatically activated in the
tax list.

### Tax grids {#italy/grids}

The Italian localization has a specific
`tax grid <accounting/tax-returns/tax-grids>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} section for **reverse charge** taxes. These tax grids are
identifiable by the `VJ <italy/grids>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
tag, and can be found by going to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Audit Reports: Tax
Report`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

![Reverse charge tax grid from the VJ section of the Tax Declaration](italy/grids.png)

## E-invoicing {#italy/e-invoicing}

The `SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
the `electronic invoicing
<../accounting/customer_invoices/electronic_invoicing>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} system used in Italy. It enables the sending and receiving
of electronic invoices to and from customers. The documents must be in
an XML `EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} format called **FatturaPA** and formally validated by the
system before being delivered.

To be able to receive invoices and notifications, the
`SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} service
must be notified that the user\'s files need to be sent to Odoo and
processed on their behalf. To do so, you must set up Odoo\'s
`Destination Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
`AdE (Agenzia Delle
Entrate)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} portal.

1.  Go to [Italian authorities
    portal](https://ivaservizi.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale) and
    authenticate;
2.  Go to section `Fatture e Corrispettivi`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"};
3.  Set the user as Legal Party for the VAT number you wish to configure
    the electronic address;
4.  In
    `Servizi Disponibili --> Fatturazione Elettronica --> Registrazione
    dell’indirizzo telematico dove ricevere tutte le fatture elettroniche`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}, insert Odoo\'s
    `Destination Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    [K95IV18]{.title-ref}, and confirm.

### EDI Mode and authorization

Since the files are transmitted through Odoo\'s server before being sent
to the `SdI (Sistema
di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or received by your
database, you need to authorize Odoo to process your files from your
database. To do so, go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings -->
Electronic Document Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

There are three modes available:

- | `Demo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  | This mode simulates an environment in which invoices are sent to the
    government. In this mode, invoices need to be *manually* downloaded
    as XML files and uploaded to the
    `AdE  (Agenzia delle Entrate)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}\'s
    website.

- | `Test (experimental)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  | This mode sends invoices to a non-production (i.e., test) service
    made available by the
    `AdE (Agenzia delle Entrate)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Saving
    this change directs all companies on the database to use this
    configuration.

- | `Official`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  | This is a production mode that sends your invoices directly to the
    `AdE (Agenzia delle  Entrate)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Once a mode is selected, you need to accept the **terms and conditions**
by ticking `Allow
Odoo to process invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and then
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. You can now record your
transactions in Odoo Accounting.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Selecting either `Test (experimental)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Official`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
**irreversible**. For example, once in `Official`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} mode, it is not possible to select `Test
(experimental)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Demo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. We recommend creating a
**separate database** for testing purposes only.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When in `Test (Experimental)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} mode,
all invoices sent *must* have a partner using one of the following fake
`Destination Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} given by the
`AdE (Agenzia Delle
Entrate)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}: [0803HR0]{.title-ref} -
[N8MIMM9]{.title-ref} - [X9XX79Z]{.title-ref}. Any real production
`Codice Destinario`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of your customers
will not be recognized as valid by the test service.
::::

![Electronic document invoicing settings](italy/edi.png)

### Process {#italy/e-invoicing-process}

The submission of invoices to the
`SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for Italy
is an electronic process used for the mandatory transmission of tax
documents in XML format between companies and the
`AdE (Agenzia delle Entrate)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to reduce
errors and verify the correctness of operations.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

You can check the current status of an invoice by the
`SdI State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. The XML file is
attached to the invoice.
::::

![EDI system architecture](italy/edi-process.png)

#### XML Documents creation

Odoo generates the required XML files as attachments to invoices in the
[FatturaPA]{.title-ref} format required by the
`AdE (Agenzia delle Entrate)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Once the
invoices needed are selected, go to `Action`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and click on `Send and Print`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Send and Print menu](italy/edi-menu.png)

When the pop-up window opens there is a selection of actions that can be
taken. `Generate
XML File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} generates the attachments.

![Send and Print dialog](italy/edi-send-and-print.png)

The XML file as well as the PDF once can be found attached to the
invoice.

![EDI Attachments](italy/edi-attachments.png)

#### Submission to SDI

The `Send to Tax Agency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option in
the `Send and Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dialog sends the
attachment to the `Proxy Server`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
which gathers all requests and then forwards them via a WebServices
channel to the `SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. Check the sending status of the invoice through the
`Check Sending`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top of
the invoice\'s view.

#### Processing by SDI

The `SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
receives the document and verifies for any errors. At this stage, the
invoice is in the `SdI Processing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
state, as shown on the invoice. The invoice also gets assigned a
`FatturaPA Transaction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} number that
is shown in the `Electronic Invoicing`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. The checks may take variable time, ranging from a
few seconds up to a day, depending on the queue of invoices sent
throughout Italy.

#### Acceptance

If the document is valid, it is recorded and considered fiscally valid
by the `AdE (Agenzia
delle Entrate)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, which will proceed with
archiving in `Substitute Storage (Conservazione
Sostitutiva)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if explicitly requested
on the Agency\'s portal.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Odoo does not offer the [Conservazione
Sostitutiva](https://www.agid.gov.it/index.php/it/piattaforme/conservazione)
requirements. Other providers and
`AdE (Agenzia delle Entrate)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} supply free
and certified storage to meet the specifications requested by law.
::::

The `SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
`Destination Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} attempts to
forward the invoice to the customer at the provided address, whether it
is a [PEC]{.title-ref} email address or a
`SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
`Destination Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for their ERP\'s
WebServices channels. A maximum of 6 attempts are made every 12 hours,
so even if unsuccessful, this process can take up to three days. The
invoice status is
`Accepted by SDI, Forwarding to Partner`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

#### Possible Rejection

The `SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} may
find inaccuracies in the compilation, possibly even formal ones. In this
case, the invoice is in the `SDI Rejected`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} state. The `SdI
(Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}\'s
observations are inserted at the top of the Invoice tab. To resolve the
issue, it is sufficient to delete the attachments of the invoice, return
the invoice to `Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and fix the
errors. Once the invoice is ready, it can be resent.

that both always contain the same data.
::::

![EDI Rejected State](italy/edi-rejected.png)

#### Forwarding Completed

The invoice has been delivered to the customer; however, you can still
send a copy to the customer in PDF via email or post. Its status is
`Accepted by SDI, Delivered to Partner`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

If the `SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
cannot contact your customer, they may not be registered on the
`AdE (Agenzia delle Entrate)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} portal. In
this case, just make sure to send the invoice in PDF via email or by
mail. The invoice is then in the `Accepted by SDI,
Partner Delivery Failed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} state.

### Tax Integration

When you receive a vendor bill, either from
`SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, from
paper or from an imported XML file, the Tax Agency might request that
you send some tax information integration back to the
`SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. It
happens when a transaction that was tax exempt becomes taxable for any
reason.

::: example
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

- | `italy/reverse-charge`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  | As a buyer, you have to pay taxes on what you buy and integrate tax
    information. `Reverse Charge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    taxes.

- | `italy/split-payment`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  | As a `PA (Public Administration)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
    business buyer, you have to pay taxes and integrate tax information.
    Be sure that you replace the `0% Sale Taxes`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} on the vendor bill you received with the correct
    `Split Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} taxes.

- | `Self Consumption`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  | When, as a business owner, you use an asset that you bought for
    business for personal reasons instead, you have to pay those taxes
    you originally deducted as a business cost for it.
:::

Odoo may detect that your vendor bill can be interpreted as a document
of a type that needs tax integration, as detailed in the
`italy/document-types`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} section.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Be sure that you replace the `0% Sale Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the vendor bill you received with the ones you\'re
supposed to pay to the `AdE (Agenzia delle Entrate)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. A button then appears on the top of the single vendor bill
form to send them.

When clicking on the `Send Tax Integration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, an XML file of the appropriate
`Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is generated,
attached to the bill, and sent as for invoices.

![EDI Send Tax Integration button](italy/edi-tax-integration-button.png)
::::

### Document Types {#italy/document-types}

The `SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
requires businesses to send customer invoices and other documents
through the `EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

The following `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} codes
all technically identify different business use cases.

#### TD01 - Invoices

This represents the standard **domestic** scenario for all invoices
exchanged through the `SdI
(Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Any invoice
that doesn\'t fall into one of the specific special cases is categorized
as a regular invoice, identified by the
`Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} [TD01]{.title-ref}.

#### TD02 - Down payments

**Down payment** invoices are imported/exported with a different
`Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} code
[TDO2]{.title-ref} than regular invoices. Upon import of the invoice, a
regular vendor bill is created.

Odoo exports transactions as [TD02]{.title-ref} if the following
conditions are met:

1.  It is an invoice;
2.  All invoice lines are related to down payment sales order lines.

#### TD04 - Credit notes

It is the standard scenario for all **credit notes** issued to
**domestic** clients, when we need to formally acknowledge that the
seller is reducing or cancelling a previously issued invoice, for
example, in case of overbilling, incorrect items, or overpayment. Just
like invoices, they must be sent to the
`SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, their
`Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} [TD04]{.title-ref}

#### TD07, TD08, TD09 - Simplified Invoicing

Simplified invoices ([TD07]{.title-ref}), credit notes
([TD08]{.title-ref}), and debit notes ([TD09]{.title-ref}) can be used
to certify domestic transactions under 400 EUR (VAT included). Its
status is the same as that of a regular invoice, but with fewer
information requirements.

For a simplified invoice to be established, it must include:

1.  `Customer Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} reference:
    **unique** numbering sequence with **no gaps**;
2.  `Invoice Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: issue **date** of
    the invoice;
3.  `Company Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the **seller**\'s
    full credentials (VAT/TIN number, name, full address) under
    `General Settings --> Companies (section)`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"};
4.  `VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the **buyer**\'s VAT/TIN
    number (on the partner form);
5.  `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total **amount**
    (VAT included) of the invoice.

In the `EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, Odoo exports invoices as simplified if:

1.  It is a domestic transaction (i.e., the partner is from Italy);
2.  Your company\'s **required fields** (`VAT Number`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} or `Codice Fiscale`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, `Fiscal Regime`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, and full **address**) are provided;
3.  The partner\'s address is not fully specified (i.e., it misses the
    City or the ZipCode);
4.  The total amount of VAT included is **less** than **400 EUR**.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The 400 EUR threshold was defined in [the decree of the 10th of May 2019
in the Gazzetta
Ufficiale](https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2019/05/24/19A03271/sg).
We advise you to check the current official value.
::::

#### TD16 - Internal Reverse Charge

Internal reverse charge transactions (see
`italy/tax-exemption`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`italy/reverse-charge`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}) are exported as
[TD16]{.title-ref} if the following conditions are met:

- It is a vendor bill;
- It has at least **one tax** on the invoice lines that targets one of
  these `tax grids
  <italy/grids>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}: [VJ6]{.title-ref},
  [VJ7]{.title-ref}, [VJ8]{.title-ref}, [VJ12]{.title-ref},
  [VJ13]{.title-ref}, [VJ14]{.title-ref}, [VJ15]{.title-ref},
  [VJ16]{.title-ref}, [VJ17]{.title-ref}

#### TD17 - Buying services from abroad

When buying **services** from **EU** and **non-EU** countries, the
foreign *seller* invoices a service with a **VAT-excluded** price, as it
is not taxable in Italy. The VAT is paid by the *buyer* in Italy.

- Within the EU: the *buyer* integrates the invoice received with the
  **VAT information** due in Italy (i.e., **vendor bill tax
  integration**);
- Non-EU: the *buyer* sends themselves an invoice (i.e.,
  **self-billing**).

Odoo exports a transaction as [TD17]{.title-ref} if the following
conditions are met:

- It is a vendor bill;
- It has at least **one tax** on the invoice lines that targets the tax
  grid `VJ3
  <italy/grids>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"};
- All invoice lines either have `Services`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} as **products**, or a tax with the
  `Services`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as **tax scope**.

#### TD18 - Buying goods from EU

Invoices issued within the EU follow a **standard format**, therefore
only an integration of the existing invoice is required.

Odoo exports a transaction as [TD18]{.title-ref} if the following
conditions are met:

- It is a vendor bill;
- The **partner** is from an **EU** country;
- It has at least one tax on the invoice lines that targets the tax grid
  `VJ9 <italy/grids>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"};
- All invoice lines either have `Consumable`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} as **products**, or a tax with
  `Goods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as **tax scope**.

#### TD19 - Buying goods from VAT deposit

Buying **goods** from a **foreign** vendor, but the **goods** are
already in **Italy** in a **VAT deposit**.

- From the EU: the *buyer* integrates the invoice received with the
  **VAT information** due in Italy (i.e., **vendor bill tax
  integration**);
- Non-EU: the *buyer* sends an invoice to *themselves* (i.e.,
  **self-billing**).

Odoo exports a transaction as a [TD19]{.title-ref} if the following
conditions are met:

- It is a vendor bill;
- It has at least one tax on the invoice lines that targets the tax grid
  `VJ3 <italy/grids>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"};
- All invoice lines either have `Consumables`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} as products, or a tax with `Goods`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} as **tax scope**.

#### TD24 - Deferred invoices

The **deferred invoice** is an invoice that is **issued at a later
time** than the sale of goods or the provision of services. A **deferred
invoice** has to be issued at the latest within the **15th day** of the
month following the delivery covered by the document.

It usually is a **summary invoice** containing a list of multiple sales
of goods or services carried out in the month. The business is allowed
to **group** the sales into **one invoice**, generally issued at the
**end of the month** for accounting purposes. Deferred invoices are
default for **wholesalers** having recurrent clients.

If the goods are transported by a **carrier**, every delivery has an
associated **Documento di Transporto (DDT)**, or **Transport Document**.
The deferred invoice **must** indicate the details of all the **DDTs**
information for better tracing.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

E-invoicing of deferred invoices requires the
[l10n_it_stock_ddt]{.title-ref}
`module <italy/modules>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. In this case, a
dedicated `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
[TD24]{.title-ref} is used in the e-invoice.
::::

Odoo exports transactions as [TD24]{.title-ref} if the following
conditions are met:

1.  It is an invoice;
2.  It is associated with deliveries whose **DDTs** have a **different**
    date than the issue date of the invoice.

#### TD28 - San Marino

##### Invoices

San Marino and Italy have special agreements on e-invoicing operations.
As such, **invoices** follow the regular **reverse charge** rules. You
can use the proper `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
depending on the invoice type: [TD01]{.title-ref}, [TD04]{.title-ref},
[TD05]{.title-ref}, [TD24]{.title-ref}, [TD25]{.title-ref}. Additional
requirements are not enforced by Odoo. However, the user is requested by
the **State** to:

- Select a tax with the `Tax Exemption Kind`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} set to [N3.3]{.title-ref};
- Use the generic `SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} `Destination Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  [2R4GTO8]{.title-ref}.

The invoice is then routed by a dedicated office in San Marino to the
correct business.

##### Vendor Bills

When a **paper bill** is received from San Marino, any Italian company
**must** submit that invoice to the
`AdE (Agenzia delle Entrate)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by
indicating the e-invoice\'s `Document Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field with the special value [TD28]{.title-ref}.

Odoo exports a transaction as [TD28]{.title-ref} if the following
conditions are met:

1.  It is a vendor bill;
2.  It has at least one tax on the invoice lines that targets the tax
    grids `VJ <italy/grids>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"};
3.  The **country** of the partner is **San Marino**.

## Public Administration Businesses (B2G)

`PA (Public Administration)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} businesses
are subjected to more control than private businesses as they handle
public money coming from taxpayers. The
`EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
process adds some steps to the
`regular one <italy/e-invoicing-process>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
as `PA (Public
Administration)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} businesses can
**accept** or **refuse** invoices.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`PA (Public Administration)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} businesses
have a 6-digit long `Destination Code`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, also called
`CUU (Codice Univoco Ufficio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, that is
**mandatory**, **PEC** address cannot be used in this case.
::::

::: seealso
[Complete list of businesses that belong to the Public Administration
along with their Destination
Code](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/web/guest/aree-tematiche/fatturazione-elettronica)
:::

### CIG, CUP, DatiOrdineAcquisto

To ensure the effective traceability of payments by public
administrations, electronic invoices issued to public administrations
must contain:

- The `CIG (Codice Identificativo Gara)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
  except in cases of exclusion from traceability obligations provided by
  law n. 136 of August 13, 2010;
- The `CUP (Codice Unico di Progetto)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
  in case of invoices related to public works.

If the XML file requires it, the
`AdE (Agenzia Delle Entrate)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can *only*
proceed payments of electronic invoices when the XML file contains a
`CIG (Codice Identificativo Gara)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
`CUP (Codice Unico di Progetto)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `CUP (Codice Unico di Progetto)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
the `CIG (Codice Identificativo Gara)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
must be included in one of the [DatiOrdineAcquisto]{.title-ref},
[DatiContratto]{.title-ref}, [DatiConvenzione]{.title-ref},
[DateRicezione]{.title-ref}, or [DatiFattureCollegate]{.title-ref} XML
tags.

These correspond to the elements named `CodiceCUP`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `CodiceCIG`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of
the electronic invoice XML file, whose table can be found on the
government [website](http://www.fatturapa.gov.it/).
::::

### Split Payment {#italy/split-payment}

The `Split Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} mechanism behaves
much like `italy/reverse-charge`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

::: example
When an Italian company bills a
`PA (Public Administration)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} business -
for example, cleaning services for a public building - the
`PA (Public Administration)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} business
self-reports the VAT to the Tax Agency themselves, and the vendor just
has to select the appropriate tax with the right
`Tax Exemption`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for their invoice
lines.
:::

The specific `Scissione dei Pagamenti`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} fiscal position is available to deal with partners
belonging to the `PA (Public Administration)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

### Process

#### Qualified electronic signature {#italy/digital-signature}

Invoices and bills intended for the
`PA (Public Administration)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} must include
a **qualified electronic signature** when submitted through the
`SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. This
signature is automatically applied in the
`XAdES (XML Advanced Electronic Signature)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} format when the invoice\'s partner has a 6-digit long
`Destination Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (which indicates a
`PA (Public Administration)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} business).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When such an invoice is transmitted to the Tax Agency, the generated
[.xml]{.title-ref} file is signed on the Odoo servers, returned to the
database, and attached to the invoice automatically.
::::

#### Acceptance or Refusal

After receiving the invoice through the
`SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
`PA (Public
Administration)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} business has 15 days to
accept the invoice. If it does, then the process ends here. If the
`PA (Public Administration)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} business
refuses the invoice, it is still considered valid once it is accepted by
the `SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. You
then have to issue a credit note to compensate and send it to the
`SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

#### Expired Terms

If the `PA (Public Administration)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
business doesn\'t reply within 15 days, you need to contact the
`PA (Public Administration)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} business
directly, sending them both the invoice and the received deadline
notification by email. You can make an arrangement with them and
manually set the correct `SdI State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
on your invoice.

## Point of Sale fiscal printers

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Fiscal printers are distinct from `ePOS printers
</applications/sales/point_of_sale/configuration/epos_printers>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. The IP address for a fiscal printer should not be entered
in the ePOS IP address settings.
::::

Fiscal regulations mandate using certified RT devices, such as RT
printers or RT servers, to ensure compliant sales receipts and secure
communication with the Tax Authority. These devices automatically
transmit fiscal data daily. RT printers, designed for individual POS
terminals, handle transactions, print receipts, and report to the
authorities, ensuring data integrity and compliance.

### Simulation mode

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Since the simulation mode sends data to the authorities, it should only
be enabled at the very start of the printer\'s configuration process.
Once the printer is switched to the production mode, it cannot be
reverted to the simulation mode.
::::

To test the fiscal printer setup with Odoo, configure the fiscal printer
in the simulation mode as follows:

1.  Make sure the fiscal printer is set to its default state: printer
    on, start-up cycle complete, and no transaction in progress.
2.  Type [3333]{.title-ref}.
3.  Press `Chiave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The screen
    displays `Scelta Funzione`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
4.  Type [14]{.title-ref}. The screen displays
    `Apprendimento`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
5.  Type [62]{.title-ref}. The screen displays
    `Simulazione`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
6.  To turn the `no`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} into a
    `si`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, press `X`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.
7.  To confirm, press `Contante`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
8.  Press `Chiave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To configure the printer for production, repeat the steps above.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To test the printer configuration, the physical device must first be
obtained and registered with the relevant authorities.
::::

### Setting up the printer to work with Odoo

Fiscal printers are meant to work only in the local network. This means
the printer and the device running
`Odoo Point of Sale </applications/sales/point_of_sale>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} must be connected to the same network.

Fiscal printers are typically configured to use HTTP by default. To
ensure compatibility with Odoo, the settings must be updated to enable
HTTPS support on the printer. This can be done using either the
EpsonFPWizard configuration software or the keyboard connected to the
printer.

To set up the fiscal printer using the keyboard, follow these steps:

1.  Make sure the fiscal printer is set to its default state: printer
    on, start-up cycle complete, and no transaction in progress.
2.  Type [3333]{.title-ref}.
3.  Press `Chiave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The screen
    displays `Scelta Funzione`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
4.  Type [34]{.title-ref}. The screen displays
    `Web Server`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
5.  Press `Contante`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} 3 times until
    the screen displays `Web Server: SSL`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.
6.  To turn the value [0]{.title-ref} into a [1]{.title-ref}, press
    `X`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
7.  To confirm, press `Contante`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} 3
    times.
8.  Press `Chiave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then, log in to the printer with the device that runs
`Odoo Point of Sale
</applications/sales/point_of_sale>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} so it
recognizes the printer\'s certificate.

To approve and install the printer\'s certificate, follow these steps:

1.  Access the printer by opening a web browser and entering
    [https://\<ip-of-your-printer\>]{.title-ref} in the address bar. A
    `Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} security message appears.
2.  Click `Advanced`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to show the
    certificate approval options.
3.  Click `Proceed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to validate the
    certificate.

Then, to ensure
`Odoo Point of Sale </applications/sales/point_of_sale>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is configured with the fiscal printer, go to
`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. In the `Connected Devices`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, add the IP address in the
`Italian Fiscal Printer
IP address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and enable
`Use HTTPS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Ri.Ba. (Ricevuta Bancaria)

`Ri.Ba. (Ricevuta Bancaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is a payment
method widely used in Italy where vendors request payments through their
bank, which forwards the request to the customer\'s own bank and takes
responsibility for the collection. This enables payment automation and
reduces risks for the vendor.

The vendor generally uploads a fixed-format text file with the list of
payments to the bank\'s web portal.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Ri.Ba. are exclusively for **domestic payments** in Italy. For
recurring international payments, please use [SEPA Direct Debt
(SDD)](../accounting/payments/batch_sdd)
::::

### Configuration

1.  Check that the [l10n_it_riba]{.title-ref} module is
    `installed <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

2.  Go to
    `Settings --> Users & Companies --> Companies`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and select the company that will use Ri.Ba.

3.  Fill out the required `SIA Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

    ![The company\'s SIA code](italy/sia-code.png)

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    The `SIA Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} identifies
    businesses within the Italian banking network and is used to receive
    money through specific payment methods. It consists of one letter
    and four digits (e.g., T1234) and can usually be found on the
    bank\'s portal or obtained by contacting the bank.
    ::::

4.  Ensure the Company\'s bank account has an Italian IBAN.

## Localization overview {#localizations/jordan/specifics}

The Jordanian localization package ensures compliance with Jordanian
fiscal and accounting regulations. It includes tools for managing taxes,
fiscal positions, reporting, and a predefined chart of accounts tailored
to Jordan\'s standards.

The Jordanian localization package provides the following key features
to ensure compliance with local fiscal and accounting regulations:

- `../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: a predefined structure tailored to Jordanian accounting
  standards
- `localizations/jordan/taxes`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:
  pre-configured tax rates, including standard VAT, zero-rated, and
  exempt options
- `../accounting/taxes/fiscal_positions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}:
  automated tax adjustments based on customer or supplier registration
  status
- `localizations/jordan/tax-reporting`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:
  detailed overview of your net tax liability
- `E-invoicing (JoFotara)<localizations/jordan/jofotara>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: integration for electronic invoicing in line with
  Jordanian government requirements

### Taxes {#localizations/jordan/taxes}

The following `taxes <../accounting/taxes>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} are available by default with the Jordanian localization
package:

- standard sales tax (16%): applied to most goods and services within
  Jordan.
- exempt transactions: for sales and services not subject to VAT, such
  as financial services or healthcare.
- export tax (0%): zero-rated tax applied to goods and services exported
  outside Jordan.

### Tax reporting {#localizations/jordan/tax-reporting}

The
`VAT summary <../accounting/reporting/tax_returns>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} provides a detailed breakdown of taxable, zero-rated, and
exempt transactions. Like other `financial reports
<../accounting/reporting>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, the VAT
summary can be filtered by period, compared against other periods, and
exported in Excel and PDF formats, ensuring compliance with Jordanian
tax laws.

## E-invoicing with JoFotara {#localizations/jordan/jofotara}

E-invoicing with JoFotara is integrated with Odoo, ensuring compliance
with Jordanian government\'s technical and legal requirements for
electronic invoicing. The JoFotara integration in Odoo directly connects
with the Jordanian e-invoicing platform, allowing companies to:

- generate compliant electronic invoices
- submit invoices in real time for validation
- track invoice statuses directly within Odoo

The integration requires first creating an account with JoFotara, then
generating API credentials, and finally entering those credentials in
your Odoo database to link the two.

[Government
manuals](https://istd.gov.jo/EN/List/Electronic_billing_User_Manual)
provide instructions for creating an account and generating the API
credentials.

### Configuration {#localizations/jordan/jofotara-configuration}

#### Link Odoo to JoFotara {#localizations/jordan/linking-jofotara}

1.  If you don\'t already have an account, create one by going to the
    [government
    manuals](https://istd.gov.jo/EN/List/Electronic_billing_User_Manual)
    page and following the steps in the **Procedure Manual for Joining
    the Jordanian National Electronic Invoicing System**.
2.  Generate API credentials (Activity Number, Secret Key, and Client
    ID) by going to the [government
    manuals](https://istd.gov.jo/EN/List/Electronic_billing_User_Manual)
    page and following the steps in **Procedure Manual for Linking to
    the Jordanian National Electronic Invoicing System**.
3.  In your Odoo database, go to
    `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}. In the
    `Electronic Invoicing (Jordan)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    section, enter the API credentials generated previously:
    - `Activity Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (income
      source sequence)
    - `JoFotara Secret Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    - `JoFotara Client ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
4.  Enter the `Taxpayer type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    - `Unregistered in the sales tax`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"}: for businesses not registered for sales tax. No
      tax on the invoice line is required.
    - `Registered in the sales tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
      for businesses registered under the standard sales tax system. One
      tax computed as a percentage is required per invoice line.
    - `Registered in the special sales tax`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"}: for businesses subject to special sales tax
      regulations. One tax computed as a percentage and one fixed tax
      per invoice line are required per invoice.
5.  Click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If the `Electronic Invoicing (Jordan)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section is missing from the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, make sure the
`Jordan E-Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} module is
`installed
<general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

#### Company and customers {#localizations/jordan/company-and-contacts}

The JoFotara invoicing workflow requires address information related to
the company that sends the invoices and the customers who receive them:

1.  Go to
    `Settings --> Users & Companies --> Companies`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and select the company that will use JoFotara.

2.  Fill in the `Company Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (TIN), and
    `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If desired, fill in
    additional optional fields such as `Street`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, `City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
    `ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

    :::: important
    ::: title
    Important
    :::

    - The `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be set to
      `Jordan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

    \- The `Company Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must match
    the name that is registered with the Income and Sales Tax Department
    (ISTD).
    - The company\'s `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must
      be set to `JOD`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
    ::::

3.  Go to `Accounting --> Customers --> Customers`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.

4.  For each customer whose invoices will be sent to JoFotara, click on
    the customer to open the form view, and complete the
    `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
    `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If desired, fill in
    additional optional fields such as `Street`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, `City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
    `ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Sending invoices to JoFotara via Odoo {#localizations/jordan/sending-invoices}

Once the company has been
`linked with JoFotara <localizations/jordan/linking-jofotara>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and the `company and customers have been properly configured
<localizations/jordan/company-and-contacts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, invoices can be sent to JoFotara via Odoo:

1.  Go to `Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and open a confirmed (posted) invoice.
2.  Click `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
3.  In the `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window, select
    `JoFotara (Jordan EDI)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and click
    `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

When an invoice is sent to JoFotara, Odoo does the following:

- generates the invoice in the required format (UBL 1.2)
- submits the invoice to JoFotara for validation
- receives the QR code from JoFotara on the invoice\'s PDF

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- Multiple invoices can be
`sent at once <accounting/invoice/sending>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to JoFotara. - From the `Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} list view, filter the invoices by their
`localizations/jordan/jofotara-state`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to
see the invoices that have either been sent or not been sent to
JoFotara. - In the `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
(`adjust settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) menu, add the
`JoFotara State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`JoFotara Error`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields to see the
sending state and any errors in the list view, respectively.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

There is an inherent difference in how values are approximated in Odoo
and ISTD due to the differing system architectures. JOD values in Odoo
are stored and approximated to three decimals, whereas ISTD expects
values to have nine decimals. As a result, an insignificant difference
is inevitable and arises between the values stores in Odoo and the
values reported to ISTD, which can have an error margin of \<0.001.
::::

#### JoFotara State {#localizations/jordan/jofotara-state}

The `JoFotara State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field in the
`Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of confirmed
invoices reflects the current state of the document in JoFotara. It can
be changed manually to reflect the actual state of the invoices in cases
where a technical error or timeout prevents Odoo from updating it
automatically.

#### Validating QR codes (Sanad app) {#localizations/jordan/qr-codes}

To validate the QR code received from JoFotara on the invoice, follow
these steps:

1.  Install the [Sanad app](https://www.sanad.gov.jo/Default/en).
2.  Navigate to `More`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
3.  Click on `Validate document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
    scan the QR code.
4.  Review results.

#### Debit and credit notes {#localizations/jordan/debit-credit}

To send a debit or credit note to JoFotara, first create the `debit
<accounting/credit_notes/issue-debit-note>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or `credit note
<accounting/credit_notes/issue-credit-note>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. In the `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window,
click `JoFotara (Jordan EDI)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
submit it for real-time validation. Upon successful validation, the QR
code from JoFotara is embedded in the debit or credit note PDF.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Ensure that the `Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
generating a debit/credit note aligns with ISTD regulations.
::::

#### Discounts {#localizations/jordan/discounts}

JoFotara does not support negative quantities or negative prices on
invoice lines. As a result, global discount and fixed amount discount
functionality are not supported.

Discounts must be applied **per invoice line as a percentage** instead
of as a global discount or fixed amount.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Attempting to submit invoices to JoFotara with negative invoice lines
will result in validation errors.

# Kenya

## Configuration {#localization/kenya/configuration}

Install the 🇰🇪 **Kenyan**
`fiscal localization package <fiscal_localizations/packages>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to get all the features of the Kenyan localization.

## eTIMS

The [Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA)](https://www.kra.go.ke/) has
implemented the [electronic Tax Invoice Management System
(eTIMS)](https://www.kra.go.ke/online-services/etims) for tax
collection.

To submit documents through eTIMS, you must use an
`OSCU (Online Sales Control Unit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that
integrates with the existing **Trader Invoicing System (TIS)**, such as
the one provided by Odoo. The OSCU is used to validate, encrypt, sign,
transmit, and store tax invoices.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Make sure to `install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
the **Kenya eTIMS EDI** modules to use the OSCU device fully.
::::

### OSCU device initialization {#kenya/initialization}

The OSCU must be initialized before use. To do so, navigate to
`Settings --> General
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, click
`Update Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Companies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and enter your
`Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To initialize the OSCU:

1.  Go to `Settings --> General Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and scroll down to the `Kenya
    eTIMS Integration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.
2.  Set the `eTIMS Server Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
    `Test`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the initialization.
3.  Enter the `Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the
    device and tick the two check boxes.
4.  Click `Initialize OSCU`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Three server modes are available:

- `Demo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Designed for demo purposes;
  it uses mock data and does not require an initialized OSCU;
- `Test`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Used to test the connection
  to eTIMS;
- `Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Used for live
  databases that are ready to send data.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If your device has **already been initialized** (through another ERP,
for example), enable the
`../../general/developer_mode`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. Then, in
the `Kenya eTIMS Integration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section, enter the ID of the unit in the `Unit ID`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field and the key obtained through a previous
initialization in the `CMC Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. Click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} when done.
::::

Once the **OSCU module** has been
`initialized <kenya/initialization>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, an
OSCU serial number is generated for each company on that database with
its **country** set to `Kenya`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
serial number is generated based on the VAT number of the company
(regardless of its validity). It is a unique and sequential serial
number starting with the prefix [ODOO]{.title-ref} followed by the
company\'s **VAT number** and a sequence of numbers.

### Registering on eTIMS

Taxpayers *must* sign up and create an account on the [KRA
portal](https://etims.kra.go.ke/basic/login/indexLogin). If you do not
have an account yet:

1.  Sign up, enter your **PIN**, and verify that all information is
    correct, including your phone number, email address, and postal
    address. Correct any errors on the [iTax
    page](https://itax.kra.go.ke/KRA-Portal/).
2.  An `OTP (One-time Password)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is sent
    to the phone number provided. Unblock promotional messages if you do
    not receive it.
3.  Upload the **business owner ID** *or* **director\'s ID** (as listed
    on iTax), along with the filled-out and signed **commitment form** .
4.  On the **eTIMS dashboard**, click

Common standard codes are **automatically** fetched from the KRA eTIMS
API servers every two days. To fetch them manually, proceed as follows:

1.  Enable the `../../general/developer_mode`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}.
2.  Go to
    `Settings --> Technical --> Automation: Scheduled Actions`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and search for
    `KE eTIMS: Fetch KRA standard codes`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.
3.  Click the action in the list, then click
    `Run Manually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to fetch the
    codes.

Go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> KE OSCU Codes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to view the complete list of fetched OSCU codes.

![List of fetched OSCU codes.](kenya/oscu-codes.png)

### UNSPSC codes {#etims/unspsc}

The KRA needs UNSPSC codes for a product to be **registered**. UNSPSC
codes are **automatically** fetched from the KRA eTIMS API servers every
day. To fetch them manually, proceed as follows:

1.  Enable the `../../general/developer_mode`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}.
2.  Go to
    `Settings --> Technical --> Automation: Scheduled Actions`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and search for
    `KE eTIMS: Fetch UNSPSC codes from eTIMS`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.
3.  Click the action in the list, then click
    `Run Manually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to fetch the
    codes.

Go to the **product form**, and in the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, click the `UNSPSC
Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to view the complete
list of fetched UNSPSC codes.

### Notices

Notices are **automatically** fetched from the KRA eTIMS API servers
every day. To fetch them **manually**, proceed as follows:

1.  Enable the `../../general/developer_mode`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}.
2.  Go to
    `Settings --> Technical --> Automation: Scheduled Actions`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and search for
    `KE eTIMS: Fetch KRA notices from eTIMS`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.
3.  Click the action in the list, then click
    `Run Manually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to fetch the
    notices.

Go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> KE OSCU Notices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to view the complete list of fetched notices.

### Multi-company

:::: {#kenya/branch}
::: seealso
`../../general/companies`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::
::::

If you have
`multiple companies <accounting/multi-company>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, you can centralize and manage them all on a single Odoo
database. The KRA identifies and differentiates the **parent** company
from its **subsidiaries** by using IDs. Furthermore, subsidiaries are
classified as `branches
<general/companies/branches>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} of the
parent company.

To configure the company\'s ID, open the **Settings** app, click
`Update Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Companies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and search for
the `eTIMS Branch Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. The
**parent company** has a branch ID equal to [00]{.title-ref} in a
multi-company environment. Companies that are *not* the parent company
have a branch ID other than [00]{.title-ref} and are assigned an ID by
the KRA.

To fetch the **branch ID** from the KRA for your non-parent companies,
ensure the parent company has a Kenyan `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and the OSCU device has been
`initialized <kenya/initialization>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
Then, go to the `Branches`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and
click `Populate from KRA`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- The KRA considers each **place of supply** as a separate branch
(ID). - The **OSCU** device must be
`initialized independently <kenya/initialization>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for each branch.
::::

### Contact branch ID

To attribute a branch ID to a contact, access the contact form, go to
the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and enter the
branch code in the `eTIMS Branch Code`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

By default, contacts\' branch IDs are set to [OO]{.title-ref}.
::::

### KRA sequences

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo invoice sequences and KRA sequences are **different**.
::::

In Odoo, invoice sequences depend on the **parent company**. Parent
companies can see the invoices of branches, but branches **cannot** see
the parent company\'s invoices or those of other branches.

The KRA needs **independent** sequences per branch. Therefore, Odoo
manages sequences individually per branch.

::: example
If you have a parent company with two branches, the invoice sequence
would be the following:

- Creating an invoice on **branch 1**: INV/2024/00001;
- Creating an invoice on **branch 2**: INV/2024/00002;
- Creating an invoice on the **parent company**: INV/2024/00003.

This is how Odoo manages sequences to be compliant with the KRA
regulations:

- Creating an invoice on **branch 1**: INV/2024/00001;
- Creating an invoice on **branch 2**: INV/2024/00001;
- Creating an invoice on the **parent company**: INV/2024/00001.
:::

## Insurance

For **health service providers**, you can send insurance information
about the parent and branch companies and update it in eTIMS. To do so,
go to `Accounting --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, scroll to the
`Kenya eTIMS Integration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
and fill in the `Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and `Rate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} fields. Click `Send Insurance
Details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} when done.

## Product registration {#kenya/product-registration}

The KRA requires **products to be registered** first before conducting
business operations (such as stock movements,
`BOM (Bill of Materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, customer
invoices, etc.). For a product to be registered, the following fields
must be defined on the product form:

- In the `General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:
  `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- In the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:
  - `Packaging Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
  - `Packaging Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
  - `Origin Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
  - `eTIMS Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
  - `Insurance Applicable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
  - `UNSPSC Category <etims/unspsc>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

If the elements above are defined, the product is automatically
registered while sending the operation to the KRA. If not, you will be
alerted by a yellow banner at the top of the screen inviting you to
check the missing elements.

![Product registration template.](kenya/product-registration.png)

## Stock movements

All **stock movements** must be sent to the KRA. They do not require an
invoice if they are internal operations or stock adjustments; therefore,
Odoo automatically sends them if at least one of the following
conditions are met:

1.  No contact is set for the move;
2.  The contact is your parent company or a branch of the parent
    company.

If the stock moves are **external operations** (e.g., to contacts that
are not part of the parent company or its branches), the stock moves are
automatically sent *after* the invoice is sent to eTIMS.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- The stock move must be confirmed before sending the invoice to
eTIMS. - The product(s) must be
`registered <kenya/product-registration>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
for the stock move to be sent to eTIMS. If the product has not been
registered yet, a yellow banner will prompt the products\' registration.
::::

## Purchases

Odoo automatically fetches new vendor bills from eTIMS every day. You
need to confirm the fetched vendor bills and send the confirmation to
the KRA. To confirm a vendor bill, it must be linked to one or several
confirmed purchase order line(s).

::: {#kenya/purchases}
In the case of purchases (not customs imports), the steps to link
purchase order lines with bills are the following:
:::

1.  Go to `Accounting --> Vendors --> Bills`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}. The vendor bill is fetched from the KRA
    servers. The JSON file is available in the chatter of the vendor
    bill if needed.

2.  Odoo looks at the `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (PIN)
    of the vendor (partner);

    - If it is unknown, a new contact (partner) is created.
    - If it is known and the branch ID is the same, Odoo uses the known
      contact.

3.  In the fetched bill from the KRA, select the
    `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Each vendor bill
    *must* contain a product to be confirmed and sent to eTIMS later on.

4.  Odoo checks existing purchase order lines matching the product(s)
    entered at the previous step and the partner (if any). Click the
    `Purchase Order Line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and
    select the correct related purchase order line(s) matching the
    product(s). The quantities on the bill *must* be the same as the
    received quantities indicated on the purchase order.

    If no existing purchase order line matches the lines of the fetched
    bill, click `Create Purchase Order`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} and create a purchase order based on the unmatched
    line(s). `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the resulting
    stock move and `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the
    bill.

5.  Set a method in the `eTIMS Payment Method`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field..

6.  Once all steps are completed, click
    `Send to eTIMS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to send the
    vendor bill. When the vendor bill has been confirmed on eTIMS, the
    **KRA invoice number** can be found in the
    `eTIMS Details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

This is the **advised sales flow** in Odoo when selling:

1.  Create a **sales order**.
2.  `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the delivery.
3.  `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the invoice.
4.  Click `Send and print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and then
    enable `Send to eTIMS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
5.  Click `Send & print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to send the
    invoice.

Once the invoice has been sent and signed by the KRA, the following
information can be found on it:

- **KRA invoice number**;
- Mandatory KRA invoice fields, such as **SCU information**, **date**,
  **SCU ID**, **receipt number**, **item count**, **internal date**, and
  **receipt signature**;
- The **KRA tax table**;
- A unique **KRA QR code** for the signed invoice.

## Imports

Customs import codes are **automatically** fetched from the KRA eTIMS
API servers every day. To fetch them manually, proceed as follows:

1.  Enable the `../../general/developer_mode`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}.
2.  Go to
    `Settings --> Technical --> Automation: Scheduled Actions`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and search for
    `KE eTIMS: Receive Customs Imports from the OSCU`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.
3.  Click the action in the list, then click
    `Run Manually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to fetch the
    codes.

Go to `Accounting --> Vendors --> Customs Imports`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to view the imported codes.

The following steps are required to send and have **customs imports**
signed by the KRA:

1.  Go to `Accounting --> Vendors --> Customs Imports`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}; The customs import is fetched automatically
    from the KRA.

2.  Match the imported item with an existing registered product in the
    `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field (or create a
    product if no related product exists).

3.  Set a vendor in the `Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    field.

4.  Based on the partner, match the imported item with its related
    purchase order (see
    `purchase steps <kenya/purchases>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).
    The stock must be correctly adjusted when the customs import is
    approved.

    If no related purchase order exists, create one and
    `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} it. Then, confirm the
    delivery by clicking `Receive Products`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, then `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    on the purchase order.

5.  Click `Match and Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `Match and Reject`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, depending on
    the situation of the goods.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The JSON file received from the KRA is attached to the chatter of the
customs import.
::::

## BOM

The KRA requires all BOMs to be sent to them. To send BOMs to eTIMS, the
product and its components *must* be
`registered <kenya/product-registration>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
To access a product\'s BOM, click on the product and then click the
`Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button.

Make sure the
`KRA's required fields <kenya/product-registration>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are filled in the `KRA eTIMS details`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section of the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab in the product form, and click
`Send to eTIMS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The successful
sending of the BOM is confirmed in the chatter, where you can also find
the sent information in an attached JSON file.

## Credit notes

The KRA does not accept credit notes with quantities or prices higher
than the initial invoice. When creating a credit note, a KRA reason must
be indicated: In the credit note form, go to the
`eTIMS Details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, select the
`eTIMS Credit Note Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and then
select the invoice number in the `Reversal of`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

  generation of audit files in the `FAIA (Fichier
  d’Audit Informatisé AED)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  (Luxembourgish SAF-T) format

### Taxes {#localizations/luxembourg/taxes}

The following `taxes <../accounting/taxes>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} are available by default with the Luxembourgish localization
package:

- standard VAT (17%): applied to most goods and services within
  Luxembourg
- reduced VAT (14%, 8%, and 3%): applied to some goods and services
  within Luxembourg

### E-invoicing {#localizations/luxembourg/e-invoicing}

Odoo users in Luxembourg can register on the
`accounting/e-invoicing/peppol`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} network,
which allows exchanging e-invoices and credit notes with other
participants on the network.

The e-invoice format in Luxembourg is **BIS Billing 3.0**.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

E-invoicing via Peppol is mandatory for all B2G transactions in
Luxembourg.

## Tax reporting {#localizations/luxembourg/tax-reporting}

In Luxembourg, companies must submit a VAT declaration on a monthly,
quarterly, or annual basis to the tax office, depending on their
turnover. Companies that submit a monthly or quarterly declaration are
also required to submit the annual declaration.

Both monthly/quarterly and annual VAT declarations can be exported as
XML files to upload on the
`eCDF platform (plateforme électronique de Collecte des Données Financières)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

### Monthly / quarterly declaration

Go to `Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

In the `fa-book`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} selector, select
`Tax Report (LU)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In the `fa-calendar`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
(`Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) selector, choose the month
or quarter for which to generate the declaration.

Check the amounts generated for all four sections of the report.

If you sold to customers under a VAT exemption for SMEs during the
period, you need to manually enter the value of such sales in the
editable fields at section I, items 481 and 482. To find the amounts for
these items, you can use the `Partner Ledger`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} report:

- Go to `Accounting --> Reporting --> Partner Ledger`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}.
- In the `fa-calendar`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  (`Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) selector, choose the
  appropriate month or quarter.
- In the `fa-user`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  (`Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) selector, choose
  `Receivable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- In the `fa-folder-open`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  (`Partners`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) selector, choose the
  partners that fall under the exemption.
- Copy the total `Balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for those
  partners for the given period.

Once the declaration is correct, click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} (`action menu`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) icon,
then click `XML`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to export and
download it in XML format. You can then submit the XML file on the eCDF
platform.

### Annual declaration

#### Account tag configuration {#luxembourg/account-tag-configuration}

The following configuration allows values to be generated automatically
for sections I and III, and Appendix A of the report, based on journal
entries that impact accounts associated with each report line.

This requires using a different
`account <../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for each type of operation subject to VAT, output and input
VAT, and expense listed in those sections.

Assign the following account
`tags <chart-of-account/tags>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to accounts
you use for each type of operation subject to VAT listed in the

#### Opening the declaration

Go to `Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

In the `fa-book`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} selector, select
`Annual VAT Declaration (LU)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In the `fa-calendar`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
(`Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) selector, choose the
fiscal year dates for which to generate the declaration.

#### Completing the declaration

The annual declaration contains five sections labelled I to V, seven
appendices labelled A to G, and an additional Appendix to Operational
Expenditures.

Sections I, III, and Appendix A can be pre-populated automatically based
on the `account tag
configuration <luxembourg/account-tag-configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. After configuring the account tags,
`set the tax lock date <accounting/tax-returns/lock-date>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to the end of the fiscal year. This will trigger the
pre-computation of those values.

![Odoo Accounting populates a Luxembourgish annual VAT declaration based on account tags.](luxembourg/annual-tax-report.png)

Alternatively, the year\'s total VAT debit and credit can be manually
distributed among the various report lines in sections I and III. You
can use the `fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
(`Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) icon to manually enter the
value for each report line.

Sections II and IV are automatically computed.

You then need to manually complete appendices B through G, as well as
the Appendix to Operational Expenditures, with any additional
information to be reported.

#### Exporting the declaration

Once the declaration is complete and correct, click the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} (`action menu`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}) icon, then click `XML`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to export and download it in XML format. You can then
submit the XML file on the eCDF platform.

## FAIA audit file export {#localizations/luxembourg/faia}

`FAIA (Fichier d’Audit Informatisé AED)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
is the Luxembourgish version of the SAF-T format for accounting data
interchange. It allows exporting complete accounting data for a period
from a taxpayer\'s accounting system to the tax office.

Odoo can generate an XML file in the FAIA format that contains the
entire accounting data for a period.

To configure a tax\'s `Malaysian Tax Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, go to `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Accounting --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and open the relevant tax in the
`Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list view.

When an invoice or bill includes a tax with the
`Malaysian Tax Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set to **Tax
Exempt**, a `Tax Exemption Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
must be specified in the `MyInvois`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab before the document is sent.

### Workflow {#malaysia/myinvois/workflow}

#### Send invoices to MyInvois {#malaysia/myinvois/workflow/sending}

Invoices can be sent to MyInvois once they have been confirmed. To do
so, click `Send to MyInvois`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

#### Send bills to MyInvois

Sending a bill to MyInvois is necessary when issuing an e-Invoice on
behalf of a supplier. Once a bill is confirmed, click
`Send To MyInvois`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- In [MyInvois](https://preprod.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/content), these
vendor bills are categorized as `Self-billed Invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

- If a `Bill Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
  empty, Odoo\'s vendor bill number is used as the MyInvois number. If a
  reference is entered in the `Bill Reference`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field, that reference is used instead.
::::

##### MyInvois status {#malaysia/myinvois/workflow/sending/status}

The current MyInvois status of an invoice or bill is shown in the
`MyInvois State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field within the
`MyInvois`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

> - `Validation in Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
>   validation is being processed by MyInvois. A blue
>   `Processing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner is also
>   displayed.
> - `Valid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: it is validated by
>   MyInvois. The `Submission UID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
>   `MyInvois`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
>   `Validation Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are
>   automatically updated with information from MyInvois.

Odoo
`automatically checks and updates <../../sales/subscriptions/scheduled_actions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} the status every hour. To update it manually at any time,
click `Update MyInvois Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

#### Invoice cancellation {#malaysia/myinvois/workflow/cancellation}

Sent invoices can be canceled within 72 hours from
`Validation time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In this case, open
the invoice and click `Request Cancel`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. In the `Cancel document`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} window, include the cancellation
`Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then click
`Update Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
`MyInvois State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is updated to
`cancelled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

#### Send credit notes to MyInvois

Before sending a credit note, the original invoice must be successfully
submitted to MyInvois. Otherwise, the credit note\'s
`MyInvois State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is updated to
`Invalid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

While Odoo uses a single `credit note`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} document, MyInvois categorizes these into two types:
`credit note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`refund note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, depending on how they
are reconciled.

- `MyInvois Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This is
  created when an Odoo credit note is reconciled with the original
  invoice.
- `MyInvois Refund Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This is
  created when an Odoo credit note is reconciled with a full payment
  instead of the original invoice.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If a credit note is reconciled with only a partial payment before being
sent, it is still categorized as a `credit note`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in MyInvois.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To issue both a credit note and a refund note for the same original
invoice: - Create two separate credit notes in Odoo from the original
invoice. - For a MyInvois `Refund Note`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}: Register a payment before sending it. - For a MyInvois
`Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Do not register a
payment before sending it.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The same logic applies to credit notes created from bills: if reconciled
with a full payment, the credit note becomes a
`Self-billed Refund Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}; otherwise,
it becomes a `Self-billed Credit Note`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

#### Send debit notes to MyInvois

`Issue a debit note from an existing bill or invoice <accounting/credit_notes/issue-debit-note>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and click `Send To MyInvois`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. In MyInvois, it appears then as a
`Debit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if issued from an
invoice or a `Self-billed Debit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
from a vendor bill.

### Access invoices via QR code

When a document is successfully submitted to MyInvois, a QR code is
added to its PDF version. Scanning this code links directly to the
validated document in MyInvois.

To download the PDF from an invoice or bill:

1.  Click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    `(gear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon
2.  Select `Download`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
3.  Choose either `PDF`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `PDF without Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

## Localization overview {#l10n/mx/overview}

The Odoo Mexican localization modules allow for the signing of
electronic invoices, according to the specifications of the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} for [version 4.0 of the
CFDI](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/documentos/Anexo_20_Guia_de_llenado_CFDI.pdf),
a legal requirement, as of January 1, 2022. These modules also add
relevant accounting reports including the
`DIOT (Declaración Informativa de Operaciones con Terceros)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, enable foreign trade, and enable the creation of delivery
guides.

:::: note

In order to electronically sign any documents in Odoo, the Sign
application must be installed.

### Requirements {#l10n/mx/requirements}

It is necessary to meet the following requirements before configuring
the Mexican localization modules in Odoo:

1.  Be registered in the
    `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} with a valid
    `RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"}.
2.  Have a [Certificado de Sello Digital / Digital Seal
    Certificate](https://www.gob.mx/sat/acciones-y-programas/ certificado-de-sello-digital)
    (CSD).
3.  Choose a
    `PAC (Proveedor Autorizado de Certificación / Authorized Certification
    Provider)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Currently, Odoo works
    with the following
    `PAC (Proveedor Autorizado de Certificación / Authorized Certification
    Provider)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}s: [Solución
    Factible](https://solucionfactible.com/contenido/productos/timbrado/general#dos),
    [Quadrum](https://cfdiquadrum.com.mx/odoo/), and [SW Sapien -
    Smarter Web](https://info.sw.com.mx/sw-smarter-odoo).

### Company {#l10n/mx/company}

After installing the correct modules, the next step is to verify that
the company is configured with the correct data. To do so, go to
`Settings --> Users & Companies --> Companies`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the company to configure.

Enter the full `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
resulting form, including: `ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
code, `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} (`Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} number).

According to the requirements of the
`CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} 4.0, the name of the main company contact **must** match
the business name registered in the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, without the legal entity abbreviation. This is the same
for the `ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} code.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

From a legal point of view, Mexican companies **must** use the local
currency (MXN). To use another currency, let MXN be the default currency
and use a `pricelist
<../../sales/sales/products_prices/prices/pricing>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} instead.
::::

Next, go to `Accounting --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and scroll to the `MX Electronic
invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Under
`Service Tax Administration (SAT)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
select the `Fiscal
Regime`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that applies to the company
from the drop-down list, and click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

In order to test the Mexican localization, configure the company with a
real address within Mexico (including all fields). Add
[EKU9003173C9]{.title-ref} as the `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and [ESCUELA KEMPER URGATE]{.title-ref} as the
`Company Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. For the
`Fiscal Regime`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, use
`General de Ley Personas Morales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

### Branches

When using branches, all the invoicing information will be taken from
the main company except for the zip. Unless the
`RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is set on the branch, then the information will be taken
directly from the branch.

Branches enable users to establish multiple brands within the same
parent company. Additionally, when different fiscal regimes are required
for invoicing purposes, it is necessary to create a branch for each
regime. By default, the regime is inherited from the parent company.
However, if the regime is explicitly set on the branch, Odoo will adopt
the regime applicable to that branch.

### Contacts {#l10n/mx/contacts}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
**Contacts** application to access contact records.
::::

To create a contact that can be invoiced, go to the
`Contacts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app and click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, enter the contact name,
full `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} including the
`ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} code, `State`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} (`Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

As with the company itself, all contacts must have their correct
business name registered in the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. The `Fiscal Regime`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
must also be added in the `Sales & Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.
::::

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Having a `RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} (`Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) set but no
`Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} configured may result in
incorrect invoices.
::::

### Taxes {#l10n/mx/taxes}

In order to properly sign invoices, set the
`Factor Type <l10n/mx/factor-type>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`Tax
Object <l10n/mx/tax-object>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} fields on
sales taxes.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

RESICO ISR withholdings and some
`IEPS (Impuesto Especial sobre Producción y Servicios)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} taxes are created automatically, but the feature is not
active by default. To enable it, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

#### Factor type {#l10n/mx/factor-type}

Both the **Factor Type** and **SAT Tax Type** fields are pre-loaded in
the default taxes.

For new taxes, set these fields in
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Set the `Tax Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In the `Advanced
Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, fill
`SAT Tax Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Factor Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields.

Odoo supports four groups of `SAT Tax Types`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}: `IVA`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`ISR`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `IEPS`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `Local Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If the factor type is `Quota`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
standard calculation methods cannot be used. Instead, set the tax
calculation computation to `Custom Formula`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

::: example
.. math:: result = quantity \* 6.455

- *quantity* = the number of items in the transaction
- *6.455* = the quota value (a fixed amount per unit)
- Only per-unit quotas are supported, not quotas based on other factors
:::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Mexico manages two different kinds of 0% VAT to accommodate two
scenarios:

- For *0% VAT*, set the `Factor Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  to `Tasa`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- For *VAT Exempt*, set the `Factor Type`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to `Exento`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

#### Tax object {#l10n/mx/tax-object}

One requirement of the CFDI 4.0 is that the resulting XML file handles
the breakdown of taxes of the operation in accordance with the
regulation. There are eight different possible values that are added in
the XML file:

- \`01\`: No tax Object: This value is added automatically if the
  invoice line doesn\'t contain any taxes.
- \`02\`: Tax Object: This is the default configuration of any invoice
  line that contains taxes.
- \`03\`: Tax Object and doesn\'t require breakdown: This can only be
  added manually.
- \`04\`: Tax Object and doesn\'t have tax: This can only be added
  manually.
- \`05\`: Tax Object, VAT for PODEBI: This can only be added manually.
- \`06\`: VAT Object, No VAT forwarded: This object will be selected
  when there is an ISR withholding and no VAT tax.
- \`07\`: No VAT forwarded,
  `IEPS (Impuesto Especial sobre Producción y Servicios)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} breakdown: This object will be selected when there is an
  ISR withholding,
  `IEPS (Impuesto Especial sobre Producción y Servicios)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} tax and no VAT tax.
- \`08\`: No VAT forwarded,
  `IEPS (Impuesto Especial sobre Producción y Servicios)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} breakdown: This object can only be added manually.

The `IEPS breakdown`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status affects
the behavior of the tax objects due to the missing
`IEPS (Impuesto Especial sobre Producción y Servicios)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} when the breakdown does not happen.
::::

#### Local taxes {#l10n/mx/local-taxes}

Local taxes (e.g., *ISH*, *Cedullar*) require a separate XML node and
may not follow standard tax logic.

When configuring a local tax, its name appears in the local tax
complement. The rate is treated as a withholding if negative, or carried
forward if positive.

#### IEPS breakdown {#l10n/mx/ieps-breakdown}

By default Odoo hides the
`IEPS (Impuesto Especial sobre Producción y Servicios)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} in the invoices so that the subtotal on which the VAT is
calculated includes the amount of
`IEPS (Impuesto Especial sobre Producción y Servicios)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, this is to ensure that Fiscal Regimes that do not require
it, do not receive it.

It is possible to make the
`IEPS (Impuesto Especial sobre Producción y Servicios)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} visible in the XML by selecting the
`IEPS Breakdown`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox inside each
contact on the `Sales & Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab.

`IEPS (Impuesto Especial sobre Producción y Servicios)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} breakdown.
::::

#### Other tax configurations {#l10n/mx/tax-config}

The Mexican Localization uses
`cash basis taxes <../../finance/accounting/taxes/cash_basis>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. When registering a payment, Odoo carries out the movement
of taxes from the *Cash Basis Transition Account* to the account set in
the `Definition`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the tax
record set on the invoice or bill line. For such movement, a tax base
account is used: (`899.01.99 Base Imponible de
Impuestos en Base a Flujo de Efectivo`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}) in the journal entry when reclassifying taxes. **Do
not delete this account**.

### Withholdings {#l10n/mx/products}

By default, Odoo includes withholdings with special distributions to
allocate VAT.

When registering an invoice, add the withholding and its corresponding
VAT. Both must be included on the vendor bill to ensure correct
accounting. Using `fiscal positions
<../accounting/taxes/fiscal_positions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} is
recommended so the cash-basis entry properly splits the distribution.

::: example
For a lease vendor bill of [10000 MXN]{.title-ref}, the
[10.67%]{.title-ref} lease withholding corresponds to a [16% VAT 2/3
H]{.title-ref}. Both taxes must be applied together to reflect the
correct accounting.

## Accounting

### Electronic invoicing {#l10n/mx/e-invoicing}

The invoicing process in Odoo is based on [Annex
20](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/anexo_20.htm)
version 4.0 of electronic invoicing of the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

#### Customer invoices {#l10n/mx/invoices}

To start invoicing from Odoo, a customer invoice must be created using
the `standard invoicing
flow <../accounting/customer_invoices>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

While the document is in draft mode, changes can be made to it, some
fields take values previously set on the sale order or the contact.

The fields that need to be reviewed are:

- CFDI to public.
- Usage
- Payment Policy
- Payment Method (If Payment Policy is not set as
  `PPD (Pago en Parcialidades o Diferido/Payment in Installments or
  Deferred)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"})

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

`Usage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Payment Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be previously
set on a sale order and/or can be set on the contact for every invoice.
::::

The payment policy is a selectable field on the invoice and can be
manually set to the required policy, however if no policy is selected,
Odoo will compute an automatic policy based on the following general
rules:

The value will be set to
`PUE (Pago en una Sola Exhibición/Payment in a Single Exhibition)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} if the due date in which the payment is expected is within
the current month, in case the date is outside the current month, the
policy will be set to
`PPD (Pago en Parcialidades o Diferido/Payment in Installments or
Deferred)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} instead.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

If the payment policy is not selected and
`PPD (Pago en Parcialidades o Diferido/Payment in Installments or
Deferred)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} policy is expected, either
select an invoice `Due Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on a
different month than the current one, or choose `Payment
terms`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that imply changing the due
month (i.e., `30 Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`15 Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, as long as they fall on
the next month).
::::

After clicking on `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
customer invoice, click on the `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button to process the invoice with the government. Make sure that the
`CFDI`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox is marked.

![CFDI Checkbox](mexico/mx-send-cfdi.png)

After receiving the signed document back from the government, the
`Fiscal Folio`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears on the
document, and the XML file appears both in the
`CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} tab and attached in the chatter.

If an email address is configured on the customer contact record,
marking the `by Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`CFDI`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkboxes sends both the XML
and PDF files together.

To download the PDF file locally, click the `Print`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

When clicking `Update SAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`SAT status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the invoice
will confirm if the XML file is **Validated** in the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

On a testing environment, the message `Not Found`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} will always come up.
::::

generic customer. If however, these fields are left empty and the user
unticks the `CFDI to public`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox, a pop-up will appear blocking the operation.
::::

#### Credit notes {#l10n/mx/credit-notes}

While an invoice is a document type \"I\" (Ingreso), a credit note is a
document type \"E\" (Egreso).

An addition to the `standard flow for credit notes
<../accounting/customer_invoices/credit_notes>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is that, as a requirement of the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, there has to be a relation between a credit note and an
invoice through the fiscal folio.

Because of this requirement, the field `CFDI Origin`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} adds this relation with a [01\|]{.title-ref}, followed
by the fiscal folio of the original
`UUID (universally unique identifier)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

For the `CFDI Origin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to be
automatically added, use the `Add Credit
Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button from the invoice,
instead of creating it manually.
::::

Generally credit notes reverse the main sales account defined in the
journal, but it is also possible to globally assign an account to all
credit notes. To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and set the `Credit notes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} account under the `Default Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

On the default configuration, the credit notes account is set as
`402.01.01 Returns,
discounts or bonuses over sales and/or services at the general rate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

#### Vendor bills {#l10n/mx/vendor-bills}

Vendor bills have to have a fiscal folio for reports and payments to
work correctly, if the vendor bill was created by the purchase app or
added manually, just add the XML file of the invoice on the chatter **As
a log note** and the fiscal folio will be updated accordingly, keep in
mind that the bill **Must be in draft state** for the update to happen.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

When clicking `Update SAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`SAT status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the invoice
will confirm if the XML file is **Validated** by the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, this is also true for vendor bills.
::::

::: seealso
`../accounting/vendor_bills`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

#### Journals {#l10n/mx/journals}

The module `EDI for Mexico (Advanced Features)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} ([l10n_mx_edi_extended]{.title-ref}) must be installed
on the database to complete the `Address Issued`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field on the sales journal. This ensures that all
invoices from that sales journal, as well as
`global invoices <l10n/mx/global-invoice>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, use the correct zipcode when generating the CFDI.

To invoice within a company under different time zones with the same
user, a system parameter must be created to ensure the correct time zone
is applied when invoicing, as the user\'s time zone is used by default.

To do so, enable
`developer mode <../../general/developer_mode>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and go to
`Settings --> Technical --> System Parameters`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
create a new parameter with the key [l10n_mx_edi_tz_XX]{.title-ref}
where [XX]{.title-ref} is the ID of the journal, and set the desired
time zone as the value, for example, "America/Tijuana".

#### Payments {#l10n/mx/payments}

##### Payment policy {#l10n/mx/payment-policy}

One addition of the Mexican localization is the
`Payment Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. [According to
the SAT
documentation](https://www.sat.gob.mx/consultas/92764/comprobante-de-recepcion-de-pagos),
there are two types of payments:

- `PUE`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (Pago en una Sola
  Exhibición/Payment in a Single Exhibition)
- `PPD`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (Pago en Parcialidades o
  Diferido/Payment in Installements or Deferred)

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Payment Complements are only generated if the policy of the invoice is
set to `PPD (Pago en Parcialidades o Diferido/Payment in Installments or
Deferred)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, please note that it is a
requirement to set the `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to something different than **99 -Por definir**.
::::

![Example of an invoice with the PUE requirements.](mexico/mx-pue-payment.png)

If the invoice has a due date outside the current month, it will default
to `PPD (Pago en Parcialidades o Diferido/Payment in Installments or
Deferred)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

![Example of an invoice with the PPD requirements.](mexico/mx-ppd-payment.png)

##### Payment flow {#l10n/mx/payment-flow}

In both cases, the payment process in Odoo
`is the same <../accounting/payments>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"},
the main difference being payments related to
`PPD (Pago en Parcialidades o Diferido/Payment in Installments or
Deferred)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} invoices, by law, need to be
sent to the government as a document type \"P\" (Pago).

If a payment is related to a
`PUE (Pago en una Sola Exhibición/Payment in a Single Exhibition)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} invoice, it can be registered through the payment popup,
and be associated with the corresponding invoice. To do so, navigate to
`Accounting -->
Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
select an invoice. Then, click the `Pay`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to open the payment popup, set the
`Payment Way`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and any other fields,
and click `Create
Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
\- `../accounting/payments`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} -
`../accounting/bank/reconciliation`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

While this process is the same for PPD invoices, the addition of
creating an `electronic
document <../accounting/customer_invoices/electronic_invoicing>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} means some additional requirements are needed to correctly
send the document to the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

From a legal perspective, PPD invoices **must** include the specific
`Payment Way`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that the payment was
received. Because of this, the `Payment Way`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field **cannot** be set as
`To Define`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, thus the field will
become invisible when selecting it.

\- If a bank account number is required, add it in the
`Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of a customer\'s
contact record. - The exact configurations are in the [Anexo 20 of the
SAT](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/anexo_20.htm).
Usually, the `Bank Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} needs to
be 10 or 18 digits for transfers, 16 for credit or debit cards.
::::

If a fully-reconciled payment is related to an invoice with a
`Fiscal Folio`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Update Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears. Click the
`Update Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to send the
**payment complement** XML file to the government automatically and
display it in the
`CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} tab in both the invoice and the payment.

:::: tip

Tip
:::

While it is a bad fiscal practice, the
`PUE (Pago en una Sola Exhibición/Payment in a Single Exhibition)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} payments can also be sent to the government, however it is
required to click `Force CFDI`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`CFDI`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab for this.
::::

Similar to an invoice or credit note, the PDF and XML can be sent to the
final customer. To do so, click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(gear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to open
the actions drop-down menu and select
`Send receipt by email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
payment view.

Regardless of whether the payment was created with or without
reconciliation, it is possible to download the payment PDF from the
`CFDI`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on the invoice by clicking
the `print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![Example of the print button on the CFDI tab.](mexico/mx-print-payment.png)

#### Invoice cancellations {#l10n/mx/invoice-cancellations}

It is possible to cancel the EDI documents sent to the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. According to the [Reforma Fiscal
2022](https://www.sat.gob.mx/consultas/91447/nuevo-esquema-de-cancelacion),
since January 1st, 2022, there are two requirements for this:

- All cancellation requests require a *cancellation reason*.
- After 24 hours from the invoice creation, the client must be asked to
  approve the cancellation. If there is no response within 72 hours, the
  cancellation is processed automatically.

Invoice cancellations are updated automatically on Odoo but can take
some time, to check the status of the cancellation just press the
`Update SAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

Invoice cancellations can be made for one of the following reasons:

- 01 - Invoice issued with errors (with related document)
- 02 - Invoice issued with errors (no replacement)
- 03 - The operation was not carried out
- 04 - Nominative operation related to the global invoice

To initiate a cancellation, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select the posted invoice to cancel, and click
`Request Cancel`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, refer to the
`l10n/mx/01-invoice-cancellation`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or
`l10n/mx/02-03-04-invoice-cancellation`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
sections, depending on the cancellation reason.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Alternatively, request a cancellation from the `CFDI`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab by clicking `Cancel`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the line item.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- If a cancellation is requested on a locked period, the CFDI will be
cancelled but not the accounting entry. - If the client rejects the
cancellation, the invoice cancellation line item is removed from the
`CFDI`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
::::

##### Cancellation reason 01 {#l10n/mx/01-invoice-cancellation}

1.  In the `Request CFDI Cancellation`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} pop-up window, select `01 - Invoice issued
    with errors (with related document)`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} from the `Reason`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field and click
    `Create Replacement Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
    create a new draft invoice. This new draft invoice replaces the
    previous invoice, along with the related
    `CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"}.
2.  `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the draft and
    `Send & Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the invoice.
3.  Return to the initial invoice (i.e., the invoice from which you
    first requested the cancellation). Notice the
    `Substituted By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears
    with a reference to the new replacement invoice.
4.  Click `Request Cancel`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In the
    `Request CFDI Cancellation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    pop-up window, the
    `01 - Invoice issued with errors (with related document)`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} option is automatically selected in the
    `Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
5.  Click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The invoice cancellation is then generated with a reason line item in
the `CFDI`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![Canceled invoice line item in the CFDI tab.](mexico/mx-invoice-cancellation-reason-01.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When using the
`01 - Invoice issued with errors (with related document)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} cancellation reason, the [04\|]{.title-ref} prefix
appears in the `Fiscal Folio`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
This is an internal prefix used by Odoo to complete the cancellation and
**does not** mean that the cancellation reason was
`04 - Nominative operation related to the global invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

##### Cancellation reasons 02, 03, and 04 {#l10n/mx/02-03-04-invoice-cancellation}

In the `Request CFDI Cancellation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window, select the desired cancellation
`Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the cancellation.

Upon doing so, the invoice cancellation is generated with a reason line
item in the `CFDI`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the `SAT Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} goes back to
**Validated** it could be due to one of these three reasons:

- The invoice is labeled as *No Cancelable* in the [SAT
  Website](https://www.sat.gob.mx/home). due to the fact that it has a
  valid related document: Either another invoice linked with the
  `CFDI Origin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field or a Payment
  Complement. If so, you need to cancel any other related document
  first.
- The cancellation request is still being processed by the
  `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"}. If so, wait a few minutes and try again.
- The final customer needs to reject or accept the cancellation request
  in their [Buzón
  Tributario](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/BuzonTributario/Paginas/servicios_disponibles.html).
  This can take up to 72 hours and, in case that the cancellation
  requests gets rejected, you will need to repeat the process again.
::::

::: seealso
[Tool to validate Mexican Electronic Documents (CFDI)
status](https://verificacfdi.facturaelectronica.sat.gob.mx/)
:::

For the cancellation reasons **02**, **03** and **04**, the
`Create Replacement Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
is replaced by a `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
that requests the cancellation immediately.

Both the current `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Cancellation Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be found in
the `CFDI`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

role="ref"}, go to the `CFDI`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of
the related invoice and click `Cancel`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the line of the payment complement.

Like with invoices, go to the payment and click
`Update SAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in order to change the
`SAT Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Cancelled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Just like invoices, when creating a new payment complement, it is
possible to add the relation of the original document, by adding a
[04\|]{.title-ref} plus the fiscal folio in the
`CFDI Origin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

This action cancels the invoice and marks the `Reason`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} as `01 - Invoice
issued with errors (with related document)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

#### Invoicing special use cases {#l10n/mx/special-use-cases}

##### CFDI relations {#l10n/mx/cfdi-origin}

Sometimes it is needed to relate the current document to previously
signed CFDIs, to do so just fill the `CFDI Origin`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field on the invoice indicating a relation, there are 7
possible values:

- 01: Nota de crédito
- 02: Nota de débito de los documentos relacionados
- 03: Devolución de mercancía sobre facturas o traslados previos
- 04: Sustitución de los CFDI previos
- 05: Traslados de mercancias facturados previamente
- 06: Factura generada por los traslados previos
- 07: CFDI por aplicación de anticipo

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The format is: Origin Type\|UUID1, UUID2, \...., UUIDn where more than
one Origin Type can be added.
::::

::: example
Here is an example with two relations:

``` none
04|042FE739-7B45-4D64-B26D-360000876D83,

```

- The first section has relation type **04** with **1 UUID**
- The second section has relation type **07** with **2 UUIDs**
:::

Additionally any combination is also visible on the signed PDF.

![Example of the PDF with 3 relations.](mexico/mx-CFDI_3relations.png)

##### Multicurrency {#l10n/mx/multicurrency}

The `Main Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in Mexico is MXN.
While this is mandatory for all Mexican companies, it is possible to
send and receive invoices (and payments) in different currencies. To
enable the use of
`multicurrency <../accounting/get_started/multi_currency>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, navigate to the
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and set `[MX] Bank of
Mexico`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as the
`Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Automatic Currency Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.
Then, set the `Interval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to the
frequency you wish to update the exchange rates.

This way, the XML file of the document will have the correct exchange
rate, and the total amount, in both the foreign currency and in MXN.

It is highly recommended to use separate
`bank accounts for each currency
<../accounting/bank/foreign_currency>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The only currencies that automatically update their exchange rate daily
are: USD, EUR, GBP, JPY and CNY.
::::

##### Discounts {#l10n/mx/discounts}

By law, electronic documents sent to the government cannot have negative
lines, as this can trigger errors. Therefore, when using `Gift Cards
<../../sales/sales/products_prices/ewallets_giftcards>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} or `Loyalty Programs
<../../sales/sales/products_prices/loyalty_discount>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, the subsequent negative lines will be translated in the XML
as if they were regular `Discounts
<../../sales/sales/products_prices/prices/pricing/>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

In order to set this up, navigate to
`Sales --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and create a product [Discounts]{.title-ref}, make
sure that it has a valid `Tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
(usually `IVA`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at [16%]{.title-ref}).

After this, create and sign the invoice via
`CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, and add the [Discounts]{.title-ref} product at the bottom.
In the XML, Odoo will distribute the discount between the lines evenly,
while any math differences will be added in a rounding product.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

A [Discount]{.title-ref} and [UNSPSC Product Category]{.title-ref} for
each product variant related to `Gift
Cards`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Loyalty Programs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} have to be
created.
::::

##### Down payments {#l10n/mx/down-payments}

A common practice in Mexico is the usage of `down payments
<../../sales/sales/invoicing/down_payment>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. It\'s usage primarily consists of cases where you receive a
payment for a good or service where either the product or the price (or
both) has not been fully determined.

The `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} allows two different ways to handle this process: both of
them involve linking all invoices to each other with the
`CFDI Origin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

For this process, the `Sales <../../sales>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} app must be installed.
::::

::: seealso
[The official documentation for registration of down payments in
Mexico](http://http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/documentos/GuiaAnexo311221.pdf).
:::

###### Configuration

First, navigate to `Sales --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to create a product [Anticipo]{.title-ref} and
configure it. The `Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must
be `Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and use the
`UNSPSC Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`84111506 Servicios de facturación`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then, go to
`Sales --> Settings --> Invoicing --> Down Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and add the *Anticipo* product as the default.

###### Method A {#l10n-mx/down-payment-method-a}

This method consists of creating a down payment invoice, creating a
invoice for the total amount, and finally, creating a credit note for
the total of the down payment.

First, create a sales order with the total amount, and create a down
payment from it (either using a percentage or fixed amount). Then, sign
the document via CFDI, and register the payment.

When the time comes for the customer to get the final invoice, create it
again from the same sales order. In the
`Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} popup, select
`Regular Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Make sure to
delete the line that contains the product *Anticipo*.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

When using down payments with the Mexican localization, make sure that
the `Invoicing
Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the products are
`Ordered quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Otherwise a
customer credit note will be created.
::::

Then, copy the `Fiscal Folio`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from
the down payment invoice, and paste it into the
`CDFI Origin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the final invoice,
adding the prefix [07\|]{.title-ref} before the value and sign the
document via
`CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

Finally, create a credit note for the first invoice. Copy the
`Fiscal Folio`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the final
invoice, and paste it in the `CFDI Origin`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of the credit note, adding the prefix
[07\|]{.title-ref}. Then, sign the document via
`CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

With this, all electronic documents are linked to each other. The final
step is to fully pay the new invoice. At the bottom of the new invoice,
you can find the credit note in the
`Outstanding credits`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} - add it as
payment. Finally, register the remaining amount with the
`Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} popup.

In the sales order, all three documents should appear as \"In Payment\".

###### Method B

Another, simpler way to fulfill
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} requirements involves creating only the down payment
invoice, and a second invoice for the remnant. This method involves the
fact that negative lines are treated as discounts.

For this, follow the same process as
`Method A <l10n-mx/down-payment-method-a>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, up until the creation of the final invoice. Do not delete
the line that contains the *Anticipo* and instead rename the other
products `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to include the
text [CFDI por remanente de un anticipo]{.title-ref}. Don\'t forget to
add the `Fiscal Folio`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the down
payment invoice in the `CDFI Origin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
of the final invoice, adding the prefix [07\|]{.title-ref}.

Finally, sign the final invoice via
`CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

##### Addendas and complements {#l10n/mx/addendas-and-complements}

Addendas and complements can be included in the XML. To add one, go to
`Accounting
--> Configuration --> Addendas & Complementos (MX)`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
enter the code to be injected. Additional fields beyond standard Odoo
may be required.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

This section might require technical knowledge and may risk adding
technical debt; it is recommended to ask your account manager for the
best technical advice.
::::

Once the desired nodes are created, they can be selected on each contact
to make them appear on every invoice addressed to that contact. By
default, all the selected nodes will be added automatically on every
invoice.

It is also possible to just select the nodes as needed on every invoice
by selecting the `Other info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and
then selecting the desired nodes from `Addendas &
Complementos`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

It is possible to add more than one per contact or per invoice.
::::

##### XML reader {#l10n/mx/xml-reader}

In certain occasions, such as when you are creating invoices in another
software or in the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} directly, you would want to upload the invoices in Odoo.
The XML Reader allows you to retrieve the data from an XML file. To do
this, navigate to `Accounting --> Customers -->
Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and, in the list view,
click the `Upload`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to select
any number of XML files, and draft invoices will be automatically
created. This can work also by dragging the files from your computer and
dropping them in the view.

The draft invoices will retrieve the
`Customer information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (if it
doesn\'t exist, new ones will be created), the
`Product Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (only if products
with the same name already exist) and will calculate all taxes and
additional fields exclusive to the Mexican Localization. The import
information will appear in the chatter.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Depending on where the invoice was created, XML files could have
different values from the total calculated in Odoo. **Always**
double-check any document uploaded this way.
::::

`Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} created this way
will be able to create **payment complements** and to be canceled at any
time. If you use the `Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button,
the PDF document will have all the corresponding information.

This can be done for `Vendor Bills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
too.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To retrieve the `Fiscal Folio`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, drag
and drop XML files as a log note in the chatter for previously created
draft invoices.
::::

##### CFDI to public {#l10n/mx/cfdi}

The Mexican government requires that any goods or services that are sold
must be backed up by an invoice. If the customer does not require an
invoice or has no
`RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, a *CFDI to Public* has to be created also known as a
\"nominative\" invoice.

A contact must be created and it must have a particular name.

If the `CFDI to Public`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox in
either a sales order or an invoice is checked, the final XML will
override the data in the invoice contact and will add the following
characteristics:

- `RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"}: **XAXX010101000** if it is a national customer or
  **XEXX010101000** if it is a foreign customer
- `ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} code: The same code of the
  company
- `Usage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: S01 - Without Fiscal
  Effects

![CFDI to Public Checkbox](mexico/mx-cfdi-to-public.png)

If the final customer doesn\'t share any details, create a generic
`Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The name cannot be
[PUBLICO EN GENERAL]{.title-ref} or an error will be triggered (it can
be, for example, [CLIENTE FINAL]{.title-ref}).

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

By default sending the invoice is not allowed if the partner does not
have either the *Country* or *Zip code* set, however this is not
required if the `CFDI to public`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox is active.
::::

##### Global invoice {#l10n/mx/global-invoice}

If by the end of a certain period of time (that can vary from daily to
bimonthly, depending of your company\'s legal needs and preferences) and
the customer still has sales that weren\'t marked as regular invoices or
individual *CFDI to Public* invoices, the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} allows for the creation of a single invoice that can
contain all operations, known as a *global invoice*.

:::: note

For this process, the `Sales <../../sales/sales>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} app must be installed.

###### Setup

The `Global Invoice Serie`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
specific to each branch or company and is used to define the sequence of
global invoices. To configure it, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and navigate to the
`MX Electronic invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.
The `Global
Invoice Serie`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field can be found
within the `Service Tax Administration (SAT)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section.

![Accounting setting with an MX company.](mexico/mx-accounting-settings.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The default sequence for every company/branch is [GINV/]{.title-ref}
::::

###### Sales flow

First, create a dedicated journal in
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to maintain a separate sequence that is used for
global invoices, which function as orders when they are created.

Then, make sure that all the sales orders that need to be signed have
the following configurations:

- `CFDI to Public`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox enabled
- `Invoice Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} marked as
  `To Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

After this, go to
`Sales --> To Invoice --> Orders to Invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select all relevant sales orders and press
`Create Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Make sure to
disable the `Consolidated
Billing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox and click
`Create Draft Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Odoo will redirect to a list of invoices. Select all of them and in the
`fa-gear`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu select `Post entries`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Select all posted invoices again and go back to the
`fa-gear`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu to select `Create
Global Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In the wizard, select the `Periodicity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} indicated by a professional accountant and press
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. All invoices should be
signed under the same XML file, with the same
`Fiscal Folio`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- Click `Show`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`CFDI`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to display a list with all
related invoices. - Click `Cancel`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
the `CFDI`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to cancel the global
invoice in both the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and Odoo.

### Electronic accounting (reporting) {#l10n/mx/reporting}

For Mexico, [Electronic
Accounting](https://www.sat.gob.mx/aplicacion/42150/envia-tu-contabilidad-electronica)
refers to the obligation to keep accounting records and entries through
electronic means, and to enter accounting information on a monthly
basis, through the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} website.

It consists of three main XML files:

1.  The updated list of the chart of accounts that is currently in use
2.  A monthly trial balance, plus a closing entry report, also known as:
    *Trial Balance Month 13*
3.  An export of the journal entries in the general ledger (optional
    except in the case of a compulsory audit)

The resulting XML files follow the requirements of the [Anexo Técnico de
Contabilidad Electrónica
1.3](https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/151135/Anexo24_05012015.pdf).

In addition to this, it is possible to generate the
[DIOT](https://www.sat.gob.mx/declaracion/74295/presenta-tu-declaracion-informativa-de-operaciones-con-terceros-(diot)-):
a report of vendors\' journal entries that involve IVA taxes that can be
exported in a TXT file.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In order to use these reports, the following modules must be installed:

- `Odoo Mexican Localization Reports`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  [l10n_mx_reports]{.title-ref}
- `Mexico - Month 13 Trial Balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  [l10n_mx_reports_closing]{.title-ref}
- `Odoo Mexican XML Polizas Export`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  [l10n_mx_xml_polizas]{.title-ref}
::::

The *chart of accounts* and the *Trial Balance Month 13* reports can be
found in `Accounting --> Reporting --> Trial Balance`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. The *DIOT* report can be found in
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The specific characteristics and obligations of the reports that you
send might change according to your fiscal regime. Always contact your
accountant before sending any documents to the government.
::::

#### Chart of accounts {#l10n_mx/chart-of-accounts}

The
`chart of accounts <../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} in Mexico follows a specific pattern based on
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}\'s\' [Código agrupador de
cuentas](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/fichas_tematicas/buzon_tributario/Documents/codigo_agrupador.pdf).

It is possible to create any account, as long as it respects
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}\'s encoding group: the pattern is [NNN.YY.ZZ]{.title-ref}
or [NNN.YY.ZZZ]{.title-ref}.

::: example
Some examples are [102.01.99]{.title-ref} or [401.01.001]{.title-ref}.
:::

When a new account is created in
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Chart of
Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, with the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} encoding group pattern, the correct grouping code appears
in `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the account appears in
the *COA* report.

Once all accounts are created, make sure the correct
`Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are added as these mark the
nature of the account.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It is not advised use any pattern that ends a section with a 0 (such as
[100.01.01]{.title-ref}, [301.00.003]{.title-ref} or
[604.77.00]{.title-ref}). This triggers errors in the report. By default
Odoo will mark the accounts as yellow if the numbering will cause issue
later on, this is to prevent reports from providing inaccurate data.
::::

Once everything is set up, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Trial Balance`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click the `COA SAT (XML)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to generate an XML file containing all of the
accounts. This XML file is ready to upload to the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} website.

#### Trial balance {#l10n/mx/trial-balance}

The trial balance reports the initial balance, credit, and total balance
of your accounts, provided that you added their correct
`encoding group <l10n_mx/chart-of-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

To generate an XML file of the trial balance, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting -->
Trial Balance`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select the date,
and click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(action menu)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then select
`SAT (XML)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Trial balance report.](mexico/mx-reports-trial-balance.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Odoo does not generate the *Balanza de Comprobación Complementaria*.
::::

##### Month 13 {#l10n/mx/month-13}

An additional report is the *Month 13*: a closing balance sheet that
shows any adjustments or movements made in the accounting to close the
year.

To generate this XML document, navigate to
`Accounting --> Accounting --> Journal
Entries`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and create a new
document. Here, add all amounts to modify, and balance the debit and/or
credit of each one.

After this is done, go to the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab and check the `Month 13 Closing`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. If needed, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Trial Balance`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the date `Month 13`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, where it is possible to see the the total amount of
the year, plus all the additions of the journal entry. To generate the
XML file, click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(action menu)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then select
`SAT (XML)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

#### General ledger {#l10n/mx/general-ledger}

By law, all transactions in Mexico must be recorded digitally. Since
Odoo automatically creates all the underlying journal entries of all
invoices and payments, simply exporting the general ledger complies with
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}\'s audits and/or tax refunds.

:::: tip
::: title

The report can be filtered by period or by journal, depending on the
need.

For `Tax audit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Audit certification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, add the
`Order Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} provided by the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text

#### DIOT report {#l10n/mx/diot}

The DIOT (Declaración Informativa de Operaciones con Terceros /
*Informative Declaration of Operations with Third Parties*) is an
additional obligation with the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, where the current status of creditable and non-creditable
payments, withholdings, import taxes, and refunds of VAT from your
vendor bills are provided to the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Since July 2025 the new 2025 version of the report is available.
::::

Unlike other reports, the
`DIOT (Declaración Informativa de Operaciones con Terceros)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is uploaded to a website provided by the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} that contains the A-29 form. In Odoo, you can download the
records of your transactions as a TXT file that can be uploaded to the
form, avoiding direct capture of this data.

The transactions file contains the total amount of the payments
registered in vendor bills, broken down into the corresponding types of
IVA. The `VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Type of operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields are
mandatory for all vendors.

To download the
`DIOT (Declaración Informativa de Operaciones con Terceros)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} report as a TXT file, go to `Accounting --> Reports --> Tax
Return`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Select the desired
month, click `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(action menu)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select
`DIOT (TXT)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In case new taxes are created on the database, there are two types of
tags, the tags containing **tax** must go into the tax distribution and
the ones with the base name go on the base of the tax. All lines of a
VAT tax **must** containing at least one tax grid.

role="guilabel"} set.

![DIOT information on a vendor contact.](mexico/mx-reports-diot-contact.png)

Selecting `87 - Global Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

### External trade {#l10n/mx/external-trade}

The external trade is a complement to a regular invoice that adds
certain values in both the XML and PDF, to invoices with a foreign
customer according to [SAT
regulations](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/complemento_comercio_exterior.htm),
such as:

- The specific address of the receiver and the sender
- The addition of a `Tariff Fraction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  that identifies the type of product
- The correct
  `../accounting/customer_invoices/incoterms`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} (International Commercial Terms)
- And more, such as the *certificate of origin* and *special units of
  measure*

This allows the correct identification of exporters and importers, in
addition to expanding the description of the merchandise sold.

Since January 1, 2018, external trade is a requirement for taxpayers who
carry export operations of type A1. While the current CFDI is 4.0, the
external trade is currently on version 2.0.

:::: note

In order to use this feature, the
`EDI for Mexico (Advanced Features)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
[l10n_mx_edi_extended]{.title-ref} module must be installed.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Before installing, make sure your business needs to use this feature.
Consult your accountant first, if needed, before installing any modules.

The `CFDI to public`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox must be
ticked when creating foreign invoices.
::::

#### Configuration

##### Contacts

To configure your company contact for external trade, navigate to
`Accounting -->
Customers --> Customers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, remove
the default `Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
filter, and select your `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
name. While the CFDI 4.0 requirements require adding a valid
`ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} code in the company contact
record, the external trade complement adds the requirement that the
`City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
`State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must also be valid. All three
fields must coincide with the [Official SAT Catalog for Carta
Porte](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/catalogos_emision_cfdi_complemento_ce.htm),
or it will produce an error.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Add the `City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the company\'s *contact
record*, not in the company record itself.
::::

On the contact record, the optional fields `Locality`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Colony Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
can also be filled. These two fields also have to coincide with the data
in the `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

To configure the contact data for a foreign receiving client, navigate
to `Accounting
--> Customers --> Customers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and select the foreign client\'s contact. The contact must have the
following fields completed to avoid errors:

1.  The entire company `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    including a valid `ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} code and
    the foreign `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
2.  The foreign `RFC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (tax
    identification number), in the correct format (for example: Colombia
    [123456789-1]{.title-ref})
3.  In the `Sales & Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, to
    activate the `Needs external trade?`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} checkbox.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In the resulting XML and PDF files, the `VAT`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is automatically replaced by the generic VAT for abroad
transactions: [XEXX010101000]{.title-ref}.
::::

##### Products

All products involved with external trade have four additional fields
that are required, two of which are exclusive to external trade.

1.  The `Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the product
    must be set in the `General Information`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} tab.
2.  The `Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the product in
    the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab must be more
    than [0]{.title-ref}.
3.  The
    [correct](https://www.ventanillaunica.gob.mx/vucem/Clasificador.html)
    `Tariff
    Fraction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the product must be
    set in the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab for
    external trade.
4.  The `UMT Aduana`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
    `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab must be set and
    correspond to the `Tariff Fraction`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} for external trade.

![Required external trade product fields.](mexico/mx-external-trade-product.png)

:::: tip

Tip
:::

\- If the UoM code of the `Tariff Fraction`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is [01]{.title-ref}, the correct
`UMT Aduana`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is [kg]{.title-ref}. -
If the UoM code of the `Tariff Fraction`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is [06]{.title-ref}, the correct
`UMT Aduana`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is [Units]{.title-ref}.

#### Invoicing flow

Before creating an invoice, it is important to take into account that
external trade invoices require converting product prices into a foreign
currency such as USD. Therefore,
`multicurrency <../accounting/get_started/multi_currency>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} **must** be enabled with the foreign currency activated in
the `Currencies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. The correct
`Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to run is
`[MX] Bank of Mexico`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To convert
product prices, create a `pricelist
<../../sales/sales/products_prices/prices/pricing>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} in the foreign currency.

Then, with the correct exchange rate set up in
`Accounting --> Settings -->
Currency`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, set the
`Incoterm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the optional
`Certificate Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields in the
invoice\'s `Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

While not mandatory, the information will be more complete if
`CFDI to public`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is also active.
::::

Finally, confirm the invoice with the same process as a regular invoice,
and click the `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to sign
it via CFDI.

## Point of sale {#l10n/mx/pos}

The `Point of sale <../../sales/point_of_sale>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} adaptation of the Mexican Localization enables the creation
of invoices that comply with the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} requirements directly in the **POS session**, with the
added benefit of creating receipt tickets that allow *self-invoicing* in
a special portal and creating global invoices.

### Point of sale flow {#l10n/mx/pos/flow}

On top of the standard
`Point of Sale configuration <../../sales/point_of_sale/configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, the Mexican localization requires each payment method to be
configured with a correct `Payment Way`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} as well as a `Re-invoicing account`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to handle the accounting for invoices with the
invoicing portal.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

By default, Odoo creates pre-configured payment methods for cash, credit
card, and debit card and assigns the
`402.04.01 Re-invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} account as
default for re-invoicing.
::::

While selling on the **Point of Sale**, click the
`Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to either create or
select a customer. Here it is possible to review customer invoicing
information (such as the
`RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} or `Fiscal Regime`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) and
even modify it directly inside the session.

After selecting a customer, tick the `fa-file-text-o`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox. This
opens a menu to select the `Usage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and to define if it is an invoice to the public. Click confirm, select
the payment method, and then click validate to complete the order. The
PDF is then downloaded and it is possible to send the invoice via mail
to the final customer alongside the receipt.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To create invoices from orders, go to the `Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} menu, select the order, click
`Load Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and tick the
`fa-file-text-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox. This opens the
same menu for the `Usage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`CFDI to Public`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

![Invoice Configuration for Point of Sale.](mexico/mx-pos.png)

To sign a credit note automatically, tick the

- If a `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} validation error occurs customer will get a
  `Pro-Forma invoice
  <../../sales/sales/invoicing/proforma>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
  instead.
::::

### Self-invoicing portal {#l10n/mx/pos/portal}

If the final customer is not sure if they want to have their invoice
generated at the exact moment of the sale, it is possible to give them
the option of creating a receipt with either a QR code or a URL. To do
so, follow these steps:

1.  Go to `Point of Sale --> Configuration`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
2.  Select the `Point of Sale`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
3.  Scroll to the `Bills & Receipts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    section.
4.  Enable `Self-service invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
5.  Set the `Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
    `QR code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or `QR code +
    URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Customers who scan this QR code or follow the URL will access to a menu
where they can add their fiscal information, including the *Usage* and
*Fiscal Regime* once they enter the five digit code that is also
provided on the receipt.

On the journal entries of the session, the previously selected
**Re-invoicing account** will be used to handle reversals of the sales
entries when invoices are requested as well as be used as a sales
account for the new invoices.

::: seealso
`../../sales/point_of_sale/receipts_invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

### Global invoice {#l10n/mx/pos/global-invoice}

As with regular sales orders, global invoices can also be created from a
POS session.

For this, make sure not to select a customer or the invoice option in
the payment menu and go to
`Point of Sale --> Orders --> Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. There, select all the orders to invoice, click
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and select `Create Global Invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Like with sales orders, choose the correct
`Periodicity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and press
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

This attaches an XML file to each of the selected orders. The XML files
can be downloaded by going to the `CFDI`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. If needed, it is possible to cancel the invoice
from the same tab.

If eventually any of the orders that are part of the global invoice need
to be addressed to a customer, it is still possible to send an invoice
by entering a new POS session, clicking the `fa-bars`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(drop-down menu)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then
click `Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Change the
`All active orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter to
`Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select the order, and click
the `fa-file-text-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Global invoices, just as regular invoices, can only be grouped by
physical address. That is determined by the address set on the POS
invoice journal, so when attempting to invoice two addresses a warning
will come up to warn the user of the error.
::::

## eCommerce {#l10n/mx/ecommerce}

The eCommerce adaptation of the Mexican Localization provides and extra
step to create invoices that comply with the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} requirements on
`eCommerce  <../../websites/ecommerce>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} by
retrieving the customer data after the **Checkout** and even allowing
for the signature of **automatic invoices** after the payment is
processed, as well as sending customers the files via email and granting
them access to retrieve their PDF file from their own customer portal.

### eCommerce flow {#l10n/mx/ecommerce/flow}

During the regular checkout process, a new
`Invoicing Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} step appears, where
it is possible to request an invoice or not. If `No`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is selected, a **CFDI to Public** is created,. If
`Yes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, the
`RFC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Fiscal Regime`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Usage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are required in order to get
all information in the sales order, where its status will change to
`To Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Additionally the customer can decide whether or not to request
`IEPS Breakdown
<l10n/mx/ieps-breakdown>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Make sure to add a `UNSPSC code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
the `shipping product
<ecommerce/checkout/delivery>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

If the `Automatic Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
enabled in `Settings --> Website -->
Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, the electronic
document will be signed automatically.

## Sales {#l10n/mx/sales}

The **Sales** app contains fields that make invoicing easier, while the
fields themselves do not change the sales behavior, they are directly
copied when creating an invoice.

The copied fields are:

- Payment Way
- Payment Policy
- CFDI to public
- Usage

Additionally, it is possible to get a preview of the invoice for
validation purposes with the customer by installing the
`pro-forma module <../../sales/sales/invoicing/proforma>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. This module adds the mentioned fields to the sale order as
well as:

- Product code
- Unit code
- Fiscal regime

## Subscriptions {#l10n/mx/subscriptions}

While handling subscriptions, all the sales fields are used to create
the recurrent invoices. These are automatically signed and sent via
email with the PDF and XML attached with no additional manual actions
required.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

All invoices generated by the subscription app will always be
automatically signed with no exceptions.
::::

## Inventory {#l10n/mx/inventory}

### Customs numbers {#l10n/mx/inventory/customs}

A *customs declaration* (Pedimento Aduanero) is a fiscal document that
certifies that all contributions to the fiscal entity (the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}) have been paid for, including the import/export of goods.

According to the [Annex
20](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/anexo_20.htm) of
CFDI 4.0, in documents where the invoiced goods come from a first-hand
import operation, the `Customs Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field needs to be added to all lines of products
involved with the operation, as does the date of the document.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To do so, the
`Odoo Mexico Localization for Stock/Landing`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} [l10n_mx_edi_landing]{.title-ref} module must be
installed, in addition to the
`Inventory <../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"},
`Purchase <../../inventory_and_mrp/purchase>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, and `Sales <../../sales/sales>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} apps.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Do not confuse this feature with external trade. The customs numbers are
directly related to importing goods, while the external trade complement
is related to exporting. Consult your accountant first if this feature
is needed before doing any modifications.
::::

#### Configuration

In order to track the correct customs number for a specific invoice,
Odoo uses `landed costs
<../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/inventory_valuation/landed_costs>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. Go to
`Inventory --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and in the `Valuation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, make sure that
`Landed Costs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is activated.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

It is recommended to add a `Default Journal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to automatically fill the mandatory
`Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on landed costs even
though landed costs that only add customs numbers without adding
`Additional Costs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} do not create
journal entries.
::::

Configure the **goods-type** products that hold the customs numbers. To
do so, create the products and complete these three requirements:

- `Tracking`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} **must** be set to
  either `By Lots`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `By Unique Serial
  Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} but **not**
  `By Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} **must** be set
  to `Delivered quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Valuation by lots/serial numbers
  <../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/inventory_valuation/valuation_by_lots>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} **must** be enabled.

This will make the field `Customs invoicing`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} available on the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. Enable the field to use customs numbers with this
product.

It is important to make sure the product has a
`Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and has the
following configuration:

- `Costing Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Either
  `FIFO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `AVCO`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Either
  `Periodic`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Perpetual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The feature works regardless of whether the `inventory valuation
<../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/inventory_valuation/cheat_sheet>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is set to either `Periodic (at closing)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Perpetual (at invoicing)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

![Storable products general configuration.](mexico/mx-landing-configuration.png)

![Storable product category configuration.](mexico/mx-landing-configuration-category.png)

#### Purchase and sales flow

After configuring the product, follow the standard `purchase flow
<../../inventory_and_mrp/purchase>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

Create a purchase order from
`Purchase --> Orders --> Purchase Order`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, confirm the order to display a
`Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button. Click on the
`Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button, add the lots
or serial numbers and `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Go to `Inventory --> Operations --> Landed Costs`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and create a new record. In the
`Transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, add the receipt that was
just validated, and add the `Customs
number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

While it is possible to add costs related to the customs number at this
stage of the process, it is highly recommended to create a landed cost
from a vendor bill from your customs agent. Learn more about
`Landed Costs here
<../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/inventory_valuation/landed_costs>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
::::

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

The `Customs number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is not
editable once it is set, and cannot be repeated, however it is possible
to fix the number on the lot or serial number later by selecting a
different landed cost.
::::

![Customs number on a landed costs Inventory record.](mexico/mx-landing-inventory.png)

The customs number assigned to a specific lot or serial number can be
found on the its registry on
`Inventory --> Products --> Lots/Serial Numbers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. The `L10N Mx Edi Landed
Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field can be edited at any time
to fix any mistakes that could have occurred when registering the landed
cost. Editing the `L10N Mx Edi Landed Cost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field automatically updates the
`Customs number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the name of the
lot or serial number.

Next, create a sales order and confirm it. Click on the
`Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button that appears,
and carefully review the assigned lots/serial numbers to make sure they
are the desired values, after that `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} the delivery order.

Finally,
`create an invoice from the sales order <accounting/inv-process/so>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and confirm it. The invoice lines are created according to
the distribution of the delivery order, in cases where more than one
customs number were selected, Odoo will split the invoice lines by
quantity and customs numbers.

![Customs number on confirmed sales order product.](mexico/mx-landing-invoice.png)

### Delivery guide {#l10n/mx/inventory/delivery-guide}

A [Carta
Porte](https://www.sat.gob.mx/portal/public/tramites/complemento-carta-porte)
is a bill of lading: a document that states the type, quantity, and
destination of goods being carried.

On July 17th, 2024, version 3.1 of this
`CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} was implemented for all transportation providers,
intermediaries, and owners of goods. Odoo is able to generate a document
type \"T\" (Traslado), which, unlike other documents, is created in a
delivery order instead of an invoice or payment.

Odoo can create XML and PDF files with (or without) ground transport,
and can process materials that are treated as *Dangerous Hazards*.

In order to print the PDF, the delivery order must be signed by the
government and then it can be printed using the
`Print Carta Porte`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
delivery order.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The PDF file contains a QR code to verify the CCP code for the
authorities.
::::

In order to transport goods between warehouses, the logistic route must
contain a **Delivery** type of operation.

In order to use this feature, the
`Mexico - Electronic Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
[l10n_mx_edi_stock]{.title-ref} module must be installed.

Additionally, it is necessary to have the
`Inventory <../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and `Sales <../../sales/sales>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} apps installed.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo does not support Carta Porte type document type \"I\" (Ingreso),
air, train or marine transport.

Consult your accountant first if this feature is needed before doing any
modifications.
::::

#### Configuration

Odoo manages two different types of CFDI type \"T\". Both can be created
from either `incoming
shipments or delivery orders
<../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/shipping_receiving/daily_operations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

- `No Federal Highways`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is used when
  the `Distance to Destination`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
  [less than 30
  km](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/cartaporte/Paginas/documentos/PreguntasFrecuentes_Autotransporte.pdf).
- `Federal Transport`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is used when
  the `Distance to Destination`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  exceeds 30 km.

For No Federal Highways, no other configuration is required beyond the
standard requirements of regular invoicing (the
`RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} of the customer, the UNSPSC code, etc.).

For *Federal Transport*, several configurations have to be added to
contacts, vehicle setups, and products. Those configurations are then
included in the XML and PDF files.

##### Contacts and vehicles

Like the external trade feature, the `Address`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in both the company and the final customer must be
complete. The `ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} code,
`City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and `State`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} must coincide with the [Official SAT Catalog for Carta
Porte](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/catalogos_emision_cfdi_complemento_ce.htm).

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The `Locality`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is optional for
both addresses.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The origin address used for the delivery guide is set in `Inventory -->
Configuration --> Warehouses`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
While this is set as the company address by default, you can change it
to your correct warehouse address.
::::

This feature requires the use of
`Fleet <../../hr/fleet/new_vehicle>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to
manage vehicles. The vehicle setup is managed directly on the vehicle,
and all the required fields are only visible after checking the
`L10N Mx Is Freight Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Checking the `L10N Mx Is Freight Vehicle`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field displays the `MX Parameters`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab where the mandatory fields are required to create a
correct delivery guide. Additionally the vehicle **must** contain a
`License Plate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
`Model Year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a
`Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The `Vehicle Plate Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Number Plate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields must contain
between 5 and 7 characters.
::::

The main driver of the vehicle is set directly on the
`Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and it is possible to
add more vehicle operators in the `Intermediaries`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section. The only mandatory fields for driver contacts
are the `VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Operator License`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Delivery guide vehicle configuration.](mexico/mx-delivery-guide-vehicle.png)

:::: tip

Tip
:::

If the vehicle is rented or more intermediaries are required, it is
possible to add them in the `Intermediaries`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.
::::

##### Products

Similar to regular invoicing, all products must have a
`UNSPSC category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In addition to
this, there are two extra configurations for products involved in
delivery guides:

- The `Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be set as
  `Storable Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for stock
  movements to be created.
- In the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, the
  `Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field must be more than
  [0]{.title-ref}.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Creating a delivery guide of a product with the
`Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set to [0]{.title-ref} will
trigger an error. As the `Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
immediately stored in the delivery order, it is then necessary to return
the products and recreate the delivery order (and delivery guide) with
the correct values.
::::

#### Sales and inventory flow

To create a delivery guide, first create and confirm a sales order from
`Sales -->
Sales Order`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Click the
`Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button that is
generated, and `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the
transfer.

After the status is set to `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
you can edit the transfer, and select the
`Transport Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Additional Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

If using the `No Federal Highways`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`Transport Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, save the transfer,
and then click `Generate Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The resulting XML can be found in the chatter.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Other than the `UNSPSC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on all
products, delivery guides that use `No Federal
Highways`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} do not require any special
configuration to be sent to the government, as they are a type \"T\"
CFDI with no delivery guide complement.
::::

If using the `Federal Transport`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`Transport Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Vehicle Setup`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is displayed to be
selected. The `Gross vehicle weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
is taken from the `Vehicle setup`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
configuration where it is possible to add additional
`Extra weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to account for the
drivers and luggage.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Odoo will calculate the `Gross vehicle weight`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} with the following formula:

$$Gross vehicle weight = Vehicle weight + (Weight + Extra Weight) / 1000$$
::::

Every delivery requires a value in
`Distance to Destination (KM)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
greater than [0]{.title-ref}. Finally, enter the
`Delivery Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and click
`Generate Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

By default the `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
filled and represents the time at which the shipment leaves the
warehouse and the `Delivery Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
the time that the shipment is expected to arrive at its destination.
These values are declared in both the XML and PDF.
::::

##### Dangerous hazards

Certain values in the `UNSPSC Category`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} are considered in the [official SAT
catalog](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/complemento_carta_porte.htm)
as *dangerous hazards*. These categories need additional considerations
when creating a delivery guide with
`Federal Transport`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

First, select the product from
`Inventory --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, in the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, fill the
`Hazardous Material Designation Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Hazardous Packaging`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields with
the correct code from the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} catalog.

![Delivery guide hazardous material product required fields.](mexico/mx-delivery-guide-hazards-designation.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

There exists the possibility that a `UNSPSC Category`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} may or may not be a dangerous hazard (for example
*01010101*). If it is not dangerous, enter [0]{.title-ref} in the
`Hazardous
Material Designation Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
::::

In `MX Parameters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, complete the
`Environment
Insurer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Environment Insurance Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
well. After this, continue with the regular process to create a delivery
guide.

##### Imports and Exports

If your Carta Porte is for international operations (for exports), some
additional fields need to be taken into account.

First, make sure that all relevant `Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} have the following configuration:

- `UNSPSC Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} cannot be
  `01010101 Does not exist in the catalog`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- `Tariff Fraction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `UMT Aduana`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be set, similar
  to the `external
  trade <l10n/mx/external-trade>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} flow.
- `Material Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be set.

Then, when creating a `Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from a delivery or receipt, fill the following fields:

- `Customs Regimes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Customs Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Customs Document Identification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

Then, when creating a `Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for a receipt where the `Customs Document
Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
`Customs number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, two new fields
appear: `Customs Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Importer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The field `Customs Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should
follow the pattern [xx xx xxxx xxxxxxx]{.title-ref}. For example, [15 48
3009 0001235]{.title-ref} with **Two** spaces between text.

role="doc"}, which can be accessed through
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Return`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}

The standard **Goods and Service Tax** (GST) rate is 15%, but different
rates and exemptions exist for specific categories of goods and
services.

### Reporting {#localizations/new_zealand/reporting}

#### GST report {#localizations/new_zealand/gst-report}

The **Goods and Services Tax (GST) report** is a critical tax reporting
requirement for businesses registered for GST. The GST return is used to
report and remit GST to the **Inland Revenue Department (IRD)**.

![GST Report.](new_zealand/GST_report.png)

The base and tax amounts are collected from the **GST**, which is
pre-configured in Odoo to align with GST Return requirements (Boxes
1-15). The **GST** can also be manually configured for special use
cases, such as specific GST treatments (e.g., zero-rating for exported
agricultural goods). Once the **GST** setup for each account is
complete, Odoo automatically categorizes journal items into the
appropriate boxes. This ensures the **GST** return is accurate and fully
reflects the business\'s financial activities.

::: seealso
`Taxes documentation <../../../applications/finance/accounting/taxes>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

##### Closing the GST report {#localizations/new_zealand/gst-closing}

The
`tax return periodicity <accounting/tax-returns/periodicity>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} must be set up before submitting the
`tax return <accounting/tax-returns/report>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (**GST report**) to the **IRD**.

::: seealso
`Year-end closing documentation
<../../../applications/finance/accounting/reporting/year_end>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

Before closing the entry for the first time, enable the `developer mode
<../../../applications/general/developer_mode>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and go to `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Tax Groups`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} to
set the default **GST payable account** and **GST receivable account**.

Once the **GST payable** and **GST receivable** accounts are set up, the
**Tax Return** report generates an accurate journal closing entry
automatically, balancing the GST balance with the GST clearing account.

The balance between **GST receivable** and **payable** is set against
the tax clearing account defined on the tax group. The amount to be paid
to or received from **IRD** can then be reconciled with a bank
transaction.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The **GST** report is not submitted directly to the **IRD**. Instead,
Odoo automatically calculates the required values for each section,
providing options to audit and review the data for a clearer
understanding of its history. Businesses can then submit these values to
the [IRD portal](https://myir.ird.govt.nz/_/).
::::

#### Remittance advice {#localizations/new_zealand/remittance-advice}

A remittance advice is a document used as proof of payment to a
business. To access it, go to
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the payment(s). Then click
`fa-print`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Print`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and select `Payment Receipt`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

### EFT batch payments {#localizations/new_zealand/eft-batch-payments}

An `EFT (electronic funds transfer)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
batch file is a digital format used to facilitate bulk payment
processing for businesses. It allows companies to consolidate multiple
inbound and outbound payments into a single electronic file. This
process is commonly used by businesses handling multiple payments at
once, such as payroll or payments to multiple suppliers.

#### Configuration {#localizations/new_zealand/eft-configuration}

::: {#localizations/new_zealand/eft-settings}
> 1.  `Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
>     `EFT Batch Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} module

`Accounting --> Customers --> Customers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"},
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Vendors`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, or access the contact directly through the
**Contacts** app. Select the relevant contact, then open the
`Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Under the
`Bank Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to enter the required
details.

## Localization overview {#localizations/oman/loc-review}

The Omani localization package provides the necessary accounting setup
for companies operating in Oman, including a pre-configured chart of
accounts, taxes, fiscal positions, and a standard tax report format. It
ensures alignment with Oman VAT regulations and Royal Decree
requirements.

The Omani localization package provides the following key features to
ensure compliance with local fiscal and accounting regulations:

- `Chart of Accounts <localizations/oman/chart-of-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: based on Omani standards, with mapped account groups and
  default account mappings.
- `Taxes <localizations/oman/taxes>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:
  standard 5% VAT, zero-rated domestic as well as exports, exempt,
  imports, and reverse charge taxes.
- `Fiscal Positions <../accounting/taxes/fiscal_positions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: automated tax adjustments based on customer or supplier
  registration status.
- `Tax Report <localizations/oman/tax-report>`{.interpreted-text

The Omani
`chart of accounts <../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is based on the local rules and regulations. This includes
pre-configured account groups and mapped default accounts. Use the
`predefined structure <chart-of-account/create>`{.interpreted-text

role="doc"}, included in the Omani VAT system, are available by default
with the Omani localization package:

- Standard Rate 5%: Applies to the sale of most goods and services
  within Oman.
- Zero-Rated Supplies (0%): Applies to essential supplies where the
  seller can still reclaim input VAT.
- Exports (0%): Applies to the supply of goods and services that are
  exported outside Oman.
- Exempt Supplies: Applies to supplies that are not subject to VAT, and
  for which the supplier cannot reclaim input VAT on related purchases.
- Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM): Applies to taxable businesses in Oman
  receiving services or goods from non-resident suppliers not registered
  for VAT in Oman.
- Import VAT (5%): Applies to the importation of most goods into Oman,
  charged at the customs point of entry.

:::

## Configuration

### Install the Peruvian localization modules

Go to *Apps* and search for Peru, then click Install in the module Peru
EDI. This module has a dependency with *Peru - Accounting*. In case this
last one is not installed, Odoo installs it automatically within EDI.

![The \"Module\" filter is set on \"Peru\"](peru/peru-modules.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When you install a database from scratch selecting Peru as country, Odoo
automatically installs the base module: Peru - Accounting.
::::

#### Configure your company

In addition to the basic information in the Company, we need to set Peru
as the Country, this is essential for the Electronic Invoice to work
properly. The field **Address Type Code** represents the establishment
code assigned by the SUNAT when companies register their RUC (Unique
Contributor Registration):

![Company data for Peru including RUC and Address type code.](peru/peru-company.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

In case the Address type code is unknown, you can set it as the default
value: 0000. Be aware that if an incorrect value is entered, the
Electronic invoice validation might have errors.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The NIF should be set following the RUC format.
::::

#### Chart of Account

The chart of accounts is installed by default as part of the set of data
included in the localization module, the accounts are mapped
automatically in:

- Taxes
- Default Account Payable.
- Default Account Receivable

The chart of accounts for Peru is based on the most updated version of
the `PCGE (Plan
Contable General Empresarial)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, which is
grouped in several categories and is compatible with NIIF accounting.

### Accounting Settings {#peru-accounting-settings}

Once the modules are installed and the basic information of your company
is set, you need to configure the elements required for Electronic
Invoice. For this, go to `Accounting
--> Settings --> Peruvian Localization`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

#### Basic Concepts

Here are some terms that are essential on the Peruvian localization:

- **EDI**: Electronic Data Interchange, which in this refers to the
  Electronic Invoice.
- **SUNAT**: is the organization that enforces customs and taxation in
  Peru.
- **OSE**: Electronic Service Operator, [OSE SUNAT\'s
  definition](https://cpe.sunat.gob.pe/aliados/ose#:~:text=El%20Operador%20de%20Servicios%20Electr%C3%B3nicos%20(OSE)%20es%20qui%C3%A9n%20se%20encarga,otro%20documento%20que%20se%20emita).
- **CDR**: Receipt certificate (Constancia de Recepción).
- **SOL Credentials**: Sunat Operaciones en Línea. User and password are
  provided by the SUNAT and grant access to Online Operations systems.

#### Signature Provider

As part of the requirements for Electronic Invoice in Peru, your company
needs to select a Signature Provider that will take care of the document
signing process and manage the SUNAT validation response. Odoo offers
three options:

1.  IAP (Odoo In-App Purchase)
2.  Digiflow
3.  SUNAT

Please refer to the sections below to check the details and
considerations for each option.

##### IAP (Odoo In-App Purchase)

This is the default and the suggested option, considering the digital
ceritificate is included as part of the service.

![IAP option as signature providers.](peru/peru-IAP.png)

###### What is the IAP?

This is a signature service offered directly by Odoo, the service takes
care of the next process:

1.  Provides the Electronic invoice Certificate, so you do not need to
    acquire one by yourself.
2.  Send the document to the OSE, in this case, Digiflow.
3.  Receive the OSE validation and CDR.

###### How does it work?

The service requires Credits in order to process your electronic
documents. Odoo provides 1000 credits for free in new databases. After
these credits are consumed, you need to buy a Credit Package.

  ---------------
  Credits   EUR
  --------- -----
  1000      22

  5000      110

  10,000    220

  20,000    440
  ---------------

The credits are consumed per each document that is sent to the OSE.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If you have a validation error and the document needs to be sent one
more time, one additional credit will be charged. Therefore, it is
paramount that you verify all information is correct before sending your
document to the OSE.
::::

###### What do you need to do?

- In Odoo, once your enterprise contract is activated and you start
  working in Production, you need to buy credits once the first 1000 are
  consumed.
- As Digiflow is the OSE used in the IAP, you need to affiliate it as
  the official OSE for your company on the SUNAT website. This is a
  simple process. For more information, please check [OSE Affiliation
  guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BkrMTZIiJyi5XI0lGMi3rbMzHddOL1pa/view?usp=sharing).
- Register Digiflow as the authorized PSE, please check [PSE Affiliation
  guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QZoqWvtQERpS0pqp6LcKmw7EBlm9EroU/view?usp=sharing).

##### Digiflow

This option can be used as an alternative, instead of using the IAP
services you can send your document validation directly to Digiflow. In
this case you need to consider:

- Buy your own digital Certificate: For more detail regarding the
  official vendor list, and the process to acquire it, please refer to
  [SUNAT Digital
  Ceritifcates](https://cpe.sunat.gob.pe/informacion_general/certificados_digitales/).
- Sign a service agreement directly with
  [Digiflow](https://www.digiflow.pe/).
- Provide your SOL credentials.

![Digiflow.](peru/peru-Digiflow.png)

##### SUNAT

In case your company wants to sign directly with the SUNAT, it is
possible to select this option in your configuration. In this case you
need to consider: - Get the SUNAT Certification process accepted.

- Buy your own digital Certificate: For more detail regarding the
  official vendor list, and the process to acquire it, please refer to
  [SUNAT Digital
  Ceritifcates](https://cpe.sunat.gob.pe/informacion_general/certificados_digitales/).
- Provide you SOL credentials.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When using direct connection with the SUNAT, the SOL User must be set
with the Company RUT + User Id. Example: `20121888549JOHNSMITH`
::::

#### Testing environment

Odoo provides a testing environment that can be activated before your
company goes into production.

When using the testing environment and the IAP signature, you don't need
to buy testing credits for your transactions as all of them are
validated by default.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

By default the databases are set to work on production, make sure to
enable the testing mode if needed.
::::

#### Certificate

In case you don't use Odoo IAP, in order to generate the electronic
invoice signature, a digital certificate with the extension `.pfx` is
required. Proceed to this section and load your file and password.

![EDI Certificate wizard.](peru/peru-Certificate.png)

#### Multicurrency

The official currency exchange rate in Peru is provided by the SUNAT.
Odoo can connect directly to its services and get the currency rate
either automatically or manually.

![SUNAT displayed in Multicurrency Service option.](peru/l10n-pe-banksync-sunat.png)

Please refer to the next section in our documentation for more
information about
`multicurrencies <../accounting/get_started/multi_currency>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

### Configure Master data {#peru-master_data}

#### Taxes

As part of the localization module the taxes are created automatically
with their related financial account and electronic invoice
configuration.

![List of default taxes.](peru/peru-taxes.png)

##### EDI Configuration

As part of the taxes configuration, there are three new fields required
for electronic invoice, the taxes created by default have this data
included, but in case you create new taxes make sure you fill in the
fields:

![Taxes EDI data for Peru.](peru/peru-taxes-edi.png)

#### Fiscal Positions

There are two main fiscal positions included by default when you install
the Peruvian localization.

**Extranjero - Exportación**: Set this fiscal position on customers for
Exportation transactions.

**Local Peru**: Set this fiscal position on local customers.

#### Document Types

In some Latin American countries, including Peru, some accounting
transactions like invoices and vendor bills are classified by document
types, defined by the government fiscal authorities, in this case by the
SUNAT.

Each document type can have a unique sequence per journal where it is
assigned. As part of the localization, the Document Type includes the
country on which the document is applicable;the data is created
automatically when the localization module is installed.

The information required for the document types is included by default
so the user does not need to fill anything on this view:

![Document Type list.](peru/peru-document-type.png)

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Currently the documents supported on customer invoices are: Invoice,
Boleta, Debit Note and Credit Note.
::::

#### Journals

When creating Sales Journals, the following information must be filled,
in addition to the standard fields on the Journals:

##### Use Documents

This field is used to define if the journal uses Document Types. It is
only applicable to Purchase and Sales journals, which are the ones that
can be related to the different set of document types available in Peru.
By default, all the sales journals created use documents.

##### Electronic Data Interchange

This section indicates which EDI workflow is used in the invoice, for
Peru we must select "Peru UBL 2.1".

![Journal EDI field.](peru/peru-journal-edi.png)

:::: warning

:::

By default, the value Factur-X (FR) is always displayed, make sure you
can uncheck it manually.
::::

#### Partner

##### Identification Type and VAT

As part of the Peruvian localization, the identification types defined
by the SUNAT are now available on the Partner form, this information is
essential for most transactions either on the sender company and in the
customer, make sure you fill in this information in your records.

![Partner identification type.](peru/peru-id-type.png)

#### Product

Additional to the basic information in your products, for the Peruvian
localization, the UNSPC Code on the product is a required value to be
configured.

![UNSPC Code on products.](peru/peru-unspc-code.png)

## Usage and testing

### Customer invoice

#### EDI Elements

Once you have configured your master data, the invoices can be created
from your sales order or manually. Additional to the basic invoice
information described on `our page about the
invoicing process <../accounting/customer_invoices/overview>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, there are a couple of fields required as part of the Peru
EDI:

- **Document type**: The default value is "Factura Electronica" but you
  can manually change the document type if needed and select Boleta for
  example.

  ![Invoice document type field on invoices.](peru/peru-invoice-document-type.png)

- **Operation type**: This value is required for Electronic Invoice and
  indicates the transaction type, the default value is "Internal Sale"
  but another value can be selected manually when needed, for example
  Export of Goods.

  ![Invoice operation type field on invoices.](peru/peru-operation-type.png)

- **EDI Affectation Reason**: In the invoice lines, additional to the
  Tax there is a field "EDI Affectation Reason" that determines the tax
  scope based on the SUNAT list that is displayed. All the taxes loaded
  by default are associated with a default EDI affection reason, if
  needed you can manually select another one when creating the invoice.

  ![Tax affectation reason in invoice line.](peru/peru-tax-affectation-reason.png)

#### Invoice validation

Once you check all the information in your invoice is correct, you can
proceed to validate it. This action registers the account move and
triggers the Electronic invoice workflow to send it to the OSE and the
SUNAT. The following message is displayed at the top of the invoice:

![Sending of EDI Invoice in blue.](peru/peru-posted-invoice.png)

Asynchronous means that the document is not sent automatically after the
invoice has been posted.

##### Electronic Invoice Status {#peru-electronic-invoice-status}

**To be Sent**: Indicates the document is ready to be sent to the OSE,
this can be done either automatically by Odoo with a *cron* that runs
every hour, or the user can send it immediately by clicking on the
button "Sent now".

![Send EDI manually.](peru/peru-sent-manual.png)

**Sent**: Indicates the document was sent to the OSE and was
successfully validated. As part of the validation a ZIP file is
downloaded and a message is logged in the chatter indicating the correct
Government validation.

![Message on chatter when the invoice is valid.](peru/peru-invoice-sent.png)

In case there is a validation error the Electronic Invoice status
remains in "To be sent" so the corrections can be made and the invoice
can be sent again.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

One credit is consumed each time that you send a document for
validation, in this sense if an error is detected on an invoice and you
send it one more time, two credits are consumed in total.
::::

#### Common Errors

There are multiple reasons behind a rejection from the OSE or the SUNAT,
when this happens Odoo sends a message at the top of the invoice
indicating the error details and in the most common cases a hint to fix
the issue.

If a validation error is received, you have two options:

- In case the error is related to master data on the partner, customer
  or taxes, you can simply apply the change on the record (example
  customer identification type) and once it is done click on the Retry
  button.

- If the error is related to some data recorded on the invoice directly
  (Operation type, missing data on the invoice lines), the correct
  solution is to reset the invoice to Draft, apply the changes, and then
  send the invoice again to the SUNAT for another validation.

  ![List of common errors on invoices.](peru/peru-errors.png)

For more detail please refert to [Common errors in
SUNAT](https://www.nubefact.com/codigos-error-sunat/).

#### Invoice PDF Report

After the invoice is accepted and validated by the SUNAT, the invoice
PDF report can be printed. The report includes a QR code, indicating the
invoice is a valid fiscal document.

![Invoice PDF report.](peru/peru-PDF.png)

#### IAP Credits

Odoo's Electronic IAP offers 1000 credits for free, after these credits
are consumed in your production database, your company must buy new
credits in order to process your transactions.

Once you run out of credits a red label is displayed at the top of the
invoice indicating that additional credits are required, you can easily
buy them by accessing the link provided in the message.

![Buying credits in the IAP.](peru/peru-credits-IAP.png)

In the IAP service includes packages with different pricing based on the
number of credits. The price list in the IAP is always displayed in EUR.

#### Special Use cases

##### Cancellation process

Some scenarios require an invoice cancellation, for example, when an
invoice was created by mistake. If the invoice was already sent and
validated by the SUNAT, the correct way to proceed is by clicking on the
button Request Cancellation:

![Request invoice cancellation button.](peru/peru-cancellation.png)

In order to cancel an invoice, please provide a cancellation Reason.

###### Electronic Invoice Status

**To Cancel**: Indicates the cancellation request is ready to be sent to
the OSE, this can be done either automatically by Odoo with a *cron*
that runs every hour, or the user can send it immediately by clicking on
the button "Send now". Once it is sent, a cancellation ticket is
created, as a result the next message and CDR File are logged in the
chatter:

![Cancellation CDR sent by the SUNAT.](peru/peru-cancellation-cdr.png)

**Cancelled**: Indicates the cancellation request was sent to the OSE
and was successfully validated. As part of the validation a ZIP file is
downloaded and a message is logged in the chatter indicating the correct
Government validation.

![Invoice after cancellation.](peru/peru-cancelled.png)

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

One credit is consumed on each cancellation request.
::::

##### Export invoices

When creating exportation invoices, take into account the next
considerations:

- The Identification type on your customer must be Foreign ID.
- Operation type in your invoice must be an Exportation one.
- The taxes included in the invoice lines should be EXP taxes.

![Exportation invoices main data.](peru/peru-exp-invoice.png)

##### Advance Payments

1.  Create the advance payment Invoice and apply its related payment.
2.  Create the final invoice without considering the advance payment.
3.  Create a credit note for the Final invoice with the advance payment
    amount.
4.  Reconcile the Credit note with the final invoice.
5.  The remaining balance on the final invoice should be paid with a
    regular payment transaction.

##### Detraction Invoices

When creating invoices that is subject to Detractions, take into account
the next considerations:

1.  All the products included in the invoice must have these fields
    configured:

    ![Detraction fields on products.](peru/peru-detraction.png)

2.  Operation type in your invoice must be `1001`

    ![Detraction code on invoices.](peru/peru-detraction-invoice.png)

### Credit Notes

When a correction or refund is needed over a validated invoice, a credit
note must be generated, for this just click on the button "Add Credit
Note", a part of the Peruvian localization you need to prove a Credit
Reason selecting one of the options in the list.

![Add Credit Note from invoice.](peru/peru-credit-note.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

When creating your first credit Note, select the Credit Method: Partial
Refund, this allows you to define the credit note sequence.
::::

By default the Credit Note is set in the document type:

![Credit Note document type.](peru/peru-credit-note-document.png)

To finish the workflow please follow the instructions on
`our page about Credit Notes
<../accounting/customer_invoices/credit_notes>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The EDI workflow for the Credit notes works in the same way as the
invoices.
::::

### Debit Notes

As part of the Peruvian localization, besides creating credit notes from
an existing document you can also create debit Notes. For this just use
the button "Add Debit Note".

By default the Debit Note is set in the document type.

### Electronic delivery guide 2.0 {#peru-edg}

The *Guía de Remisión Electrónica* (GRE) is an electronic document
generated by the shipper to support the transportation or transfer of
goods from one place to another, such as a warehouse or establishment.
In Odoo, there are several configuration steps needed before you can
successfully use this feature.

The use of the *guía de remisión electrónica* electronic document is
mandatory and required by
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for taxpayers who need to
transfer their products, except those under the *Single Simplified
Regime* (régimen único simplificado or RUS).

#### Delivery guide types

##### Sender

The *Sender* delivery guide type is issued when a sale is made, a
service is rendered (including processing), goods are assigned for use,
or goods are transferred between premises of the same company and
others.

This delivery guide is issued by the owner of the goods (i.e., the
sender) at the beginning of the shipment. The sender delivery guide is
supported in Odoo.

::: seealso
[SUNAT guía de remisión](https://www.gob.pe/7899-guia-de-remision)
:::

##### Carrier

The *Carrier* delivery guide type justifies the transportation service
the driver (or carrier) performs.

This delivery guide is issued by the carrier and must be issued to each
shipper when the shipment goes through public transport.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The carrier delivery guide is **not** supported in Odoo.
::::

::: seealso
[SUNAT guía de remisión
transportista](https://tefacturo.pe/blog/sunat/guia-de-remision-electronica/guia-de-remision-transportista/)
:::

#### Transportation types

##### Private

The *Private* transportation type option is used when the owner
transfers goods using their own vehicles. In this case, a sender\'s
delivery guide must be issued.

##### Public

The *Public* transportation type option is used when an external carrier
moves the goods. In this case, two delivery guides must be issued: the
sender\'s delivery guide and the carrier\'s delivery guide.

#### Direct submission to SUNAT

The creation of the
`GRE (Guía de Remisión Electrónica)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
delivery guide in Odoo **must** be sent directly to the
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, regardless of the
electronic document provider: IAP, Digiflow, or
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

#### Required information

Version 2.0 of the electronic delivery guide requires additional
information on the general configuration, vehicles, contacts, and
products. In the general configuration, it is necessary to add new
credentials that you can retrieve from the
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} portal.

#### Cancellations

**Both** the sender and the carrier can cancel the electronic waybill as
long as the following conditions are met:

- The shipment has not been initiated.
- If the shipment has been initiated, the receiver **must** be changed
  before reaching the final destination.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} no longer uses the term
\"Anula\", but now uses the term \"Dar de baja\" for cancellations.
::::

#### Testing

The `SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} does not support a test
environment. This means that any delivery guides that were generated by
mistake **will** be sent to the
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

If, by mistake, the waybill was created in this environment, it is
necessary to delete it from the
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} portal.

#### Configuration

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

\- Electronic sender\'s
`GRE (Guía de Remisión Electrónica)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
currently the only supported type of waybill in Odoo. - The delivery
guide is dependent on the Odoo *Inventory* app, the
`l10n_pe_edi`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`l10n_pe`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} modules. - A second user
**must** be added for the creation of electronic documents.

##### Products

To configure the available products, navigate to
`Inventory --> Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
open the product to be configured.

Make sure that the applicable information in the product form is fully
configured. The `Partida Arancelaria`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
(Tariff Item) field needs to be completed.

#### Generating a GRE

Once the delivery from inventory is created during the sales workflow,
make sure you complete the
`GRE (Guía de Remisión Electrónica)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
fields on the top-right section of the transfer form for the fields:

- `Transport Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Reason for Transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Departure start date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

It is also required to complete the `Vehicle`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Operator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
fields under the `Guia de Remision PE`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.

The delivery transfer has to be marked as *Done* for the
`Generar Guia de Remision`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
appear on the left menu of the transfer form.

![Generar Guia de Remision button on a transfer form in the Done stage.](peru/generate-gre-transferview.png)

Once the transfer form is correctly validated by
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the generated XML file
becomes available in the chatter. You can now print the delivery slip
that shows the transfer details and the QR code validated by
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

![Transfer details and QR code on generated delivery slip.](peru/gre-delivery-slip.png)

#### Common errors

- [Diferente prefijo para productos (T001 en algunos, T002 en
  otros)]{.title-ref}

  At the moment, Odoo does not support the automation of prefixes for
  products. This can be done manually for each product output. This can
  also be done for non-storable products. However, keep in mind that
  there will be no traceability.

- [2325 - GrossWeightMeasure - El dato no cumple con el formato
  establecido \"Hace falta el campo\" \"Peso\"\" en el
  producto]{.title-ref}

  This error occurs when the weight on the product is set as
  [0.00]{.title-ref}. To fix this, you need to cancel the waybill and
  recreate it. Make sure that you fix the weight on the product before
  creating the new waybill, or it will result in the same error.

- [JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0) when
  creating a Delivery Guide]{.title-ref}

  This error is typically generated due to SOL user issues. Verify the
  user\'s connection with the
  `SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
  Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}; the SOL user must be
  established with the company RUT + user ID. For example
  [2012188549JOHNSMITH]{.title-ref}.

- [El número de documento relacionado al traslado de mercancía no cumple
  con el formato establecido: error: documento relacionado]{.title-ref}

  The *Related Document Type* and *Related Document Number* fields only
  apply to invoices and receipts.

- [400 Client error: Bad Request for URL]{.title-ref}

  This error is not solvable from Odoo; it is advised you reach out to
  the `SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
  Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and verify the user. It
  may be necessary to create a new user.

- [Invalid content was found starting with element
  \'cac:BuyerCustomerParty\']{.title-ref}

  This error occurs when the transfer reason is set as *other*. Please
  select another option. Following to the official documentation of the
  `SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
  Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}\'s waybill guide, the
  transfer reasons *03 (sale with shipment to third party)* or *12
  (others)* does not work in Odoo, since you should not have an empty or
  blank customer.

- [Duda cliente: consumo de créditos IAP al usar GRE 2.0]{.title-ref}

  For live clients using IAP, no credit is consumed (in theory) because
  it does not go through the OSE, i.e., these documents are directly
  sent to the
  `SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
  Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

- [Errores con formato credenciales GRE 2.0 (traceback
  error)]{.title-ref}

  Odoo currently throws an error with a traceback instead of a message
  that the credentials are not correctly configured in the database. If
  this occurs on your database, please verify your credentials.

### eCommerce electronic invoicing

First, `install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
**Peruvian eCommerce** ([l10n_pe_website_sale]{.title-ref}) module.

The **Peruvian eCommerce** module enables the features and
configurations to:

- allow clients to create online accounts for **eCommerce** purposes;
- support required fiscal fields in the **eCommerce** application;
- receive payments for sales orders online;
- generate electronic documents from the **eCommerce** application.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The **Peruvian eCommerce** module is dependent on the previous
installation of the **Invoicing** or **Accounting** app, as well as the
**Website** app.
::::

#### Configuration {#peru-ecommerce-configuration}

After configuring the Peruvian
`electronic invoicing <peru-accounting-settings>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} flow, complete the following configurations for the
**eCommerce** flow:

- `Client account registration <ecommerce/customer_accounts/checkout-access>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"};
- `Automatic invoice <ecommerce/handling/invoices>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"};
- `../../websites/ecommerce/products`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}: Set
  the `Invoicing Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
  `Ordered quantities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and define the
  desired `Customer taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `../payment_providers`{.interpreted-text role="doc"};
- `../../websites/ecommerce/shipping`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}: For
  each shipping method, set the `Provider`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field to `Fixed Price`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. Then, set a `Fixed Price`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} amount greater than [0.00]{.title-ref} (not zero), as
  the shipping method price is added to the invoice line.

:::: note

#### Invoicing flow for eCommerce

Once the
`configurations <peru-ecommerce-configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are all set, fiscal input fields will be available during
the checkout process for signed-in customers.

When customers enter their fiscal data at checkout and complete a
successful purchase, the invoice is generated with the corresponding
`EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
elements. The document type (Boleta/Factura) is selected based on their
tax ID (RUC/DNI). The invoice must then
`be sent to the OSE and the SUNAT
<peru-electronic-invoice-status>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. By
default, all published invoices are sent once a day through a scheduled
action, but you can also send each invoice manually if needed.

Once the invoice is validated with
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, customers can download the
.zip file with the CDR, XML, and PDF files directly from the customer
portal by clicking the `Download`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button.

## Reports

### Permanent inventory reports: `PLE (Programa de Libros Electrónico)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 12.1 and `PLE (Programa de Libros Electrónico)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} 13.1 {#peru/reports-ple}

Odoo can produce two permanent inventory reports as [.txt]{.title-ref}
files for Peruvian accounting:
`PLE (Programa de Libros Electrónico)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
12.1 and `PLE (Programa de Libros Electrónico)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} 13.1. All inventory transactions made need to be reported.

- `PLE (Programa de Libros Electrónico)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  12.1 **only tracks inventory in physical units**, focusing on the
  inflow and outflow of goods for effective management and planning.
- `PLE (Programa de Libros Electrónico)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  13.1 tracks **both physical quantities and monetary values of
  inventory**, providing a comprehensive view for tax and management
  purposes.

Both reports must be maintained semi-annually (January-June and
July-December), with monthly transaction details reported within these
periods. The submission deadlines are October 1st for the first semester
and April 1st for the second semester, in accordance with the
*Resolución de Superintendencia N° 169-2015*.

#### Configuration

Before generating the
`PLE (Programa de Libros Electrónico)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
12.1 or `PLE (Programa de Libros Electrónico)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} 13.1 reports, make sure the `Peru - Stock
Reports`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
([l10n_pe_reports_stock]{.title-ref}) module is installed, then update
the fields for:

- `Products <peru/reports-ple-products>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
- `Warehouses <peru/reports-ple-warehouses>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Inventory transfers <peru/reports-ple-transfers>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}

##### Products {#peru/reports-ple-products}

Several configurations related to the product or product category are
necessary for `PLE (Programa de Libros Electrónico)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} reporting:

- **Type of existence**: For all products needing
  `PLE (Programa de Libros Electrónico)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  reporting, go to the product record\'s `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} tab and select the
  `Type of Existence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} according to
  `SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
  Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}\'s table 5 for inventory
  reporting.
- **Automatic inventory valuation**: For storable goods
  (`products with tracked inventory`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}), use
  `automatic inventory valuation
  <../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/inventory_valuation/cheat_sheet>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}. Once automatic inventory valuation is enabled, this
  valuation method can be enabled for a product\'s product category.
- **Costing method:** Storable goods must use a `costing method
  <../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/inventory_valuation/cheat_sheet>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} **other** than `Standard Price`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, as the journal entries generated from stock moves
  are used to populate the
  `PLE (Programa de Libros Electrónico)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  reports.

##### Warehouses {#peru/reports-ple-warehouses}

When `setting up a warehouse
<../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/warehouses_storage/inventory_management/warehouses>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, the `Annex Establishment Code`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field must be filled. This code acts as a unique ID for
each warehouse and should only be a numeric combination, containing
between 4 to 7 digits.

##### Inventory transfers {#peru/reports-ple-transfers}

Transferring inventory is a key process captured in the
`PLE (Programa de Libros Electrónico)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
12.1 and `PLE (Programa de Libros Electrónico)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} 13.1 reports.
`Inventory transfers <../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/shipping_receiving/daily_operations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} include both incoming and outgoing shipments.

When validating an inventory transfer (either on a warehouse receipt or
delivery order), select the `Type of Operation (PE)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} performed according to
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}\'s table 12 for permanent
inventory reporting.

#### Generate a .txt file for permanent inventory Kardex reports

`PLE (Programa de Libros Electrónico)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
12.1 and 13.1 come as two separate books. The books need to be
downloaded in [.txt]{.title-ref} file format from Odoo, and then they
should be submitted to the
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración
Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
`PLE (Programa de Libros Electrónico)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
software.

On the
`Inventory Valuation Report <inventory/product_management/valuation-report>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, click the `PLE Reports`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button. Then, select the `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
choose a report to export: either the `PLE 12.1`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `PLE 13.1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Odoo
generates a [.txt]{.title-ref} file for the chosen report.

# Philippines

## Configuration

`Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
`🇵🇭 Philippines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fiscal localization package
<fiscal_localizations/packages>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to get
all the default accounting features of the Philippine localization, such
as a chart of accounts, taxes, and reports. These provide a base
template to get started with using Philippine accounting.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- When creating a new database and selecting the
[Philippines]{.title-ref} as a country, the fiscal localization module
**Philippines - Accounting** is automatically installed. - If the module
is installed in an existing company, the **chart of accounts** and
**taxes** will *not* be replaced if there are already posted journal
entries.
::::

### Chart of accounts and taxes

A minimum configuration default chart of accounts is installed, and the
following types of taxes are installed and linked to the relevant
account:

- Sales and Purchase VAT 12%
- Sales and Purchase VAT Exempt
- Sales and Purchase VAT Zero-Rated
- Sales and Purchase Withholding

For the withholding taxes
(`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}), there is an additional
`Philippines ATC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field under the
`Philippines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![Philippines ATC code field set on taxes.](philippines/philippines-atc-code.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Taxes\' ATC codes are used for the
`BIR 2307 <localizations/philippines/report-BIR1207>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`SAWT and QAP reports <localizations/philippines/report-QAP-SAWT>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. If a tax is created manually, its ATC code must be added.
::::

### Contacts

When a company or an individual (not belonging to a company) contact is
located in the Philippines, fill in the `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field with their [Taxpayer Identification Number
(TIN)]{.title-ref}.

For individuals not belonging to a company, identify them by using the
following additional fields:

- `First Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Middle Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Last Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

For both `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Individual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the TIN should follow
the [NNN-NNN-NNN-NNNNN]{.title-ref} format. The branch code should
follow the last digits of the TIN, or else it can be left as
[00000]{.title-ref}.
::::

## Reports

### BIR 2307 report {#localizations/philippines/report-BIR1207}

**BIR 2307** reports, also known as [Certificate of Creditable Tax
Withheld at
Source](https://www.bir.gov.ph/bir-forms?tab=Certificates&idTag=BIR2307&datasetCode=3381&label=2307&type=TAB%20LINK),
can be generated for purchase orders and vendor payments with the
applicable withholding taxes.

To generate a BIR 2307 report, select one or multiple vendor bills from
the list view, and click
`Action --> Download BIR 2307 XLS`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![Multiple vendor bills selected with action to \"Download BIR 2307 XLS\".](philippines/philippines-multi-bill.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The same action can be performed on a vendor bill from the form view.
::::

In the pop-up that opens, review the selection and click
`Generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Pop up menu to generate BIR 2307 XLS file.](philippines/philippines-generate.png)

This generates the [Form_2307.xls]{.title-ref} file that lists all the
vendor bill lines with the applicable withholding tax.

The process above can also be used for a *single* vendor
`payment <../accounting/payments>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} if it
is linked to one or more
`vendor bills <../accounting/payments>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
with applied withholding taxes.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- If no withholding tax is applied, then the XLS file will not generate
records for those vendor bill lines. - When grouping payments for
multiple bills, Odoo splits the payments based on the contact. From a
payment, clicking `Action --> Download BIR 2307 XLS`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} generates a report that only includes vendor bills
related to that contact.

:::

## D.406 declaration

Starting January 1, 2023, companies registered for tax purposes in
Romania must report their accounting data to the Romanian Tax Agency
monthly or quarterly in the D.406 declaration.

Odoo provides all you need to export the data of this declaration in the
SAF-T XML format, which you can validate and sign using the software
provided by the Romanian Tax Agency.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Currently, Odoo only supports the generation of the monthly/quarterly
D.406 declaration (containing journal entries, invoices, vendor bills,
and payments). The yearly declaration (including assets) and the
on-demand declaration (including inventory) are not yet supported.
::::

### Configuration

#### Company

- Under `Settings --> General Settings`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, in the **Companies** section, click
  `Update Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and fill in the
  company\'s `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Telephone Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- Provide your company\'s
  `CUI (Codul Unic de Inregistrare)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  number or `CIF (*Codul de
  identificare fiscală*)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} number (for
  foreign companies) in the `Company ID`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field, without the [RO]{.title-ref} prefix (e.g.,
  [18547290]{.title-ref}).
- If your company is **registered** for VAT in Romania, fill in the
  `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field number, including
  the [RO]{.title-ref} prefix (e.g., [RO18547290]{.title-ref}). If the
  company is **not** registered for VAT in Romania, you **must not**
  fill in the `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
- Open the **Contacts** app and search for your company. Open your
  company\'s profile, and in the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} tab, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} and add your **bank account number** if not informed
  already. Make sure the profile is set as `Company`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} above the **name**.
  - You must have at least one **contact person** linked to your company
    in the **Contacts** app. If no **contact person** is linked, create
    a new one by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, set
    it as `Individual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select
    your company in the `Company name`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field.

#### Chart of accounts

To generate a file receivable by the Romanian Tax Agency, the chart of
accounts must not deviate from an official chart of accounts, such as:

- the chart of accounts for commercial companies
  (*PlanConturiBalSocCom*), which is installed by default when creating
  a company with the Romanian localization or;
- the chart of accounts for companies following
  [IFRS](https://www.ifrs.org/) (*PlanConturiIFRS*).

Under `Settings --> Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, in
the **Romanian localization** section, set the
`Tax Accounting Basis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to reflect the
accounting regulations and Chart of Accounts used by the company.

::: seealso
`../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

#### Customer and supplier

Fill in the `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Zip Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of each partner that
appears in your invoices, vendor bills, or payments through the
**Contacts** app.

For partners that are companies, you must fill in the VAT number
(including the country prefix) in the `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. If the partner is a company based in Romania,
you may instead fill in the CUI number (without the \'RO\' prefix) in
the `Company ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

#### Tax

You must indicate the `Romanian SAF-T Tax Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} (3-digit number) and `Romanian
SAF-T Tax Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (6-digit number) on
each of the taxes you use. This is already done for the taxes that exist
by default in Odoo. To do so, go to `Accounting --> Configuration -->
Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select the tax you wish
to modify, click the `Advanced Options`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and fill in the **tax type** and **tax code**
fields.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The **tax type** and **tax code** are codes defined by the Romanian Tax
Agency for the **D.406 declaration**. These can be found in the Excel
spreadsheet published as guidance for completing the declaration, which
you can find on the [website of the Romanian Tax
Agency](https://www.anaf.ro/anaf/internet/ANAF/despre_anaf/strategii_anaf/proiecte_digitalizare/saf_t/).
::::

::: seealso
`../accounting/taxes`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

#### Product

For some types of goods transactions, the
`Intrastat Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (Cod NC) must be
configured on the product, as it is required by Romanian law:

- import / export transactions;
- acquisitions / supplies of food products subjected to reduced VAT
  rate;
- intra-community movements subjected to intrastat reporting;
- acquisitions / supplies subjected to local reversed VAT charge
  (depending on Cod NC); and
- transactions with excisable products for which excise duties are
  determined based on the Cod NC.

If the Intrastat Code is not specified on a non-service product, the
default code \'0\' will be used.

To configure the `Intrastat Codes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
go to `Accounting --> Customers --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select a product, and in the
`Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, set a
`Commodity Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
`../accounting/reporting/intrastat`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

#### Vendor bill

You must check the `Is self-invoice (RO)?`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox in the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab for any vendor bill that is a self-invoice (i.e. a
vendor bill that you issued yourself in the absence of an invoice
document received from a supplier).

### Generating the declaration

#### Exporting your data

To export the XML for the D.406 declaration, go to
`Accounting --> Reports -->
General Ledger`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and click on
`SAF-T`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Click on the \'SAF-T\' button to export the D.406 XML declaration.](romania/romania-saft-button.png){.align-center}

You can then validate and sign the XML file using the Romanian Tax
Agency\'s validation software, *DUKIntegrator*.

#### Signing the report

Download and install the *DUKIntegrator* validation software found on
the [website of the Romanian Tax
Agency](https://www.anaf.ro/anaf/internet/ANAF/despre_anaf/strategii_anaf/proiecte_digitalizare/saf_t/).

Once you have generated the XML, open \'DUKIntegrator\' and select the
file you have just generated.

Click on `Validare + creare PDF`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
create an **unsigned** PDF containing your report, or
`Validare + creare PDF semnat`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
create a **signed** PDF containing your report.

![The DUKIntegrator validation software.](romania/romania-dukintegrator.png){.align-center}

If the *DUKIntegrator* validator detects errors or inconsistencies in
your data, it generates a file that explains the errors. In this case,
you need to correct those inconsistencies in your data before you can
submit the report to the Romanian Tax Agency.

## Localization overview {#localizations/saudi-arabia/loc-review}

The Saudi Arabian localization package ensures compliance with Saudi
Arabian fiscal and accounting regulations. It includes tools for
managing taxes, fiscal positions, reporting, and a predefined chart of
accounts tailored to Saudi Arabia\'s standards.

The Saudi Arabian localization package provides the following key
features to ensure compliance with local fiscal and accounting
regulations:

- `../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: a predefined structure aligned with Saudi Arabian
  regulations
- `localizations/saudi-arabia/taxes`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:
  preconfigured tax rates, including standard 15% VAT, zero-rated, and
  exempt options
- `../accounting/taxes/fiscal_positions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}:
  automated tax adjustments based on customer or supplier registration
  status
- `Withholding taxes <localizations/saudi-arabia/withholding-taxes>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: predefined withholding tax rules for applicable service
  categories
- `localizations/saudi-arabia/tax-reporting`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: automated tax reports
- `E-invoicing (ZATCA) <localizations/saudi-arabia/zatca>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: integration for electronic invoicing in line with Saudi
  Arabian government requirements

### Taxes {#localizations/saudi-arabia/taxes}

The Saudi Arabian localization includes preconfigured sales, purchase,
and withholding `taxes
<../accounting/taxes>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}:

- | Standard VAT (15%): The prevailing rate applied to the majority of
    goods and services supplied within the Kingdom.
  | The supplier charges 15% VAT on the sale (Output VAT) and is
    generally entitled to deduct the VAT paid on its business purchases
    (Input VAT).

  ::: example
  Most commercial sales, retail goods, telecommunication services,
  non-exempt private education, and non-exempt private healthcare.
  :::

- | Zero-rated VAT (0%): These are taxable supplies where the rate of
    tax applied is 0%.
  | The supplier charges no VAT on the sale, but, critically, is fully
    entitled to recover the input VAT paid on costs related to making
    those supplies.

  ::: example
  \- Exports: Supplies of goods and services to a
  non-`GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  resident or for consumption outside the Kingdom.
  \- International transport: Services for the international transport
  of passengers and goods, and related services.
  \- Specific goods: Supplies of qualifying medicines and qualifying
  medical equipment, as specified by ZATCA/Ministry of Health.
  \- Residential property: First supply of a new residential
  building/property to a Saudi citizen, up to a value of SAR 1,000,000
  (subject to specific conditions).
  \- Investment metals: Qualifying gold, silver, and platinum of 99%
  purity or higher (supplied for investment).
  :::

- | Exempt transactions: These transactions fall outside the scope of
    VAT, meaning they are not subject to the tax.
  | The supplier does not charge any VAT on the sale and is not entitled
    to recover the input VAT paid on costs related to making these
    supplies (resulting in an unrecoverable cost).

  ::: example
  \- Financial services: interest on loans, provision of credit,
  operations of current/deposit/savings accounts, issuance or transfer
  of money or securities, and life insurance.
  - Real estate: bare rental (leasing) of residential property.
  :::

- | Import VAT: VAT is levied on goods brought into the Kingdom from a
    non-`GCC (Gulf  Cooperation Council)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
    country.
  | VAT is typically calculated at the standard rate (15%) and is paid
    to the Customs Authority at the point of importation.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When assigning
`discounts <../../sales/sales/products_prices/prices/discounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to invoices, assign a 15% tax on the line containing a
global discount to comply with ZATCA rules.
::::

#### Reverse charge mechanism (RCM)

- Description: Mechanism that shifts the responsibility for accounting
  for VAT from the non-resident supplier to the resident recipient of
  the goods or services.
- Mechanism: The VAT-registered recipient must calculate and account for
  the VAT (as both output VAT and input VAT) in their
  `VAT return <accounting/tax-returns/vat-report>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}. This typically results in a net zero effect on the VAT
  return, provided the input tax is fully deductible.
- Application: Primarily used for B2B supplies of services from a
  non-resident supplier to a VAT-registered business in Saudi Arabia.

### Withholding taxes {#localizations/saudi-arabia/withholding-taxes}

There are two available methods for calculating withholding tax: gross
and deducted.

- Gross withholding: This is the primary configuration, where the
  withholding amount is calculated in addition to the bill total. For
  example, if the total bill is entered as 115 SAR, the system
  calculates the base plus Withholding Tax (WHT) without reducing the
  payment amount.
- Deducted withholding: It reduces the payable amount by the withholding
  amount directly, meaning the total payment reflects the deduction
  upfront. This affects how the accounting entries and payable lines are
  booked.

Deducted withholding taxes are not enabled by default. To activate it,
go to Accounting \--\> Configuration \--\> Taxes and enable the relevant

The following Withholding Tax (WHT) configurations are preloaded and
available for use:

- 5% Withholding Tax: Applied on payments for rent, dividends, technical
  and consulting services, air and maritime freight, as well as
  interest, insurance, and reinsurance premiums.
- 15% Withholding Tax: Applies to royalties and other general service
  payments made to non-residents.
- 20% Withholding Tax: Reserved for management fees and specific
  high-value service payments.

### Tax reporting {#localizations/saudi-arabia/tax-reporting}

The
`VAT and Withholding Return <accounting/tax-returns/vat-report>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} provide a detailed breakdown of taxable, zero-rated, exempt,
and withholding transactions. Like other financial reports, the
`VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Withholding Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be filtered
by period, compared against other periods, and exported in Excel and PDF
formats, ensuring compliance with Saudi Arabia tax laws.

## Company and contacts {#localizations/saudi-arabia/company-contacts}

To ensure proper integration with
`ZATCA <localizations/saudi-arabia/zatca>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, the following fields are required on the
`company record <general/companies/company>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}:

- `Company Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (must match exactly
  VAT certificate)
- All relevant `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields,
  including the `District`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Building
  Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Plot Identification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Identification Scheme`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `Tax Identification Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `Commercial Registration Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `Momra License`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `MLSD License`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `700 Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `Sagia License`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `VAT Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be set to
  `SAR`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: important

## Invoicing language {#localizations/saudi-arabia/invoicing-language}

Invoices can be issued in different languages to meet regional or
customer-specific requirements at two levels:

- Customer level: To assign a preferred language to a customer, go to
  `Accounting -->
  Customers --> Customers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} or
  `Point of Sale --> Orders --> Customers`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}, and open the relevant customer form. In the
  `Language`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, update the
  language. All documents are then automatically generated in the
  selected language for that customer.

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  Saudi Arabia\'s VAT regulations require
  `Tax Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `Simplified Tax
  Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (along with corresponding
  credit notes or debit notes) to be in Arabic, mandatorily. Invoices
  can be bilingual, including English.
  ::::

- Company level: To add Arabic as a secondary language to meet Saudi
  Arabia VAT regulations:

  - For `Tax Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Go to
    `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}, in the `Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} section.
  - For Point of Sale receipts: Go to
    `Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}, and navigate to the
    `Bills & Receipts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

  Then, enable the `Gulf Cooperation Council Format`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} option, and `Save`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.

## Electronic invoicing with ZATCA {#localizations/saudi-arabia/zatca}

The ZATCA e-invoicing system is designed to streamline and digitize the
invoicing process for businesses operating in Saudi Arabia.

ZATCA Phase 2 employs a clearance e-invoicing model for
Business-to-Business (B2B) transactions. Conversely, for
Business-to-Consumer (B2C) transactions, Odoo generates a QR code and
subsequently reports these transactions to the Fatoora reporting
endpoint.

In a B2B scenario, a `Tax Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
issued, whereas in a B2C scenario, a
`Simplified Tax Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
generated.

### Step-by-step process {#localizations/saudi-arabia/step-by-step}

When onboarding to ZATCA (Phase 2), there are three modes:

- `Sandbox <localizations/saudi-arabia/sandbox>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: Common pre-configured testing environment; use it to
  simulate integration functionality out of the box.
- `Simulation (Pre-Production) <localizations/saudi-arabia/simulation>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: User-specific testing environment; use it to simulate
  your unique integration.
- `Production <localizations/saudi-arabia/production>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: Live environment

The color of the message displayed in the chatter after an invoice is
confirmed and submitted indicates the following information:

- Green: invoice successfully accepted - The invoice is fully compliant
  and has been successfully validated by ZATCA.
- Yellow: invoice accepted with warnings - The invoice is legally valid
  but was accepted with a warning. The issue should be reviewed and
  corrected for future submissions.
- Red: invoice was rejected - The invoice was not accepted by ZATCA and
  is not legally valid. It must be corrected and resubmitted.

If the invoice is rejected, an error message is displayed in the
invoice's chatter. Correct the underlying issue described in the message
description in the invoice or company settings. Then, to resubmit the
invoice, click `Retry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

\- Invoices rejected by ZATCA remain in a `Rejected`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} state and are not considered legally valid. - In case
of any incidents, technical errors, or emergency matters that prevent
the generation of e-invoices/e-receipts, notify
[ZATCA](https://zatca.gov.sa/en/E-Invoicing/FailureNotifications/Pages/VerifyTaxpayer.aspx).
Once the issue has been resolved, contact ZATCA again using the same
communication channel. For specific failure scenarios, refer to the
steps outlined in [ZATCA\'s guidelines (page

### QR code verification {#localizations/saudi-arabia/qr-code-verification}

To verify the QR Code on the invoice, scan it using the official [ZATCA
app](https://zatca.gov.sa/en/AboutUs/ZATCAApps/Pages/default.aspx).

Once in the app, click `Services`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In
the `E-Invoice Validation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
click `Start Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, begin
scanning the invoices\' QR codes.

Note
:::

\- The QR verification output does not display a currency symbol. The
invoice amount is always shown as a plain numeric value, irrespective of
the currency used. - An invoice with a related contact (e.g., Invoicing
Address) is sent to the clearance API (B2B).

### Debit and credit notes {#localizations/saudi-arabia/debit-and-credit-notes}

To create a
`credit <accounting/credit_notes/issue-credit-note>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or `debit
<accounting/credit_notes/issue-debit-note>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} note, include a ZATCA-approved reason from the
`ZATCA Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field in the
`Credit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}/`Debit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} window, as required by ZATCA regulations:

- Cancellation or suspension of the supplies after their occurrence,
  either wholly or partially.
- Essential change or amendment in the supply that results in a change
  to the VAT due.
- Amendment of the supply value that was pre-agreed between the supplier
  and the consumer.
- Goods or services refund.
- Change in the seller's or buyer's information.

### Down payments (advance payments) {#localizations/saudi-arabia/advance-payments}

Handle
`down payments (advance payments) <../../sales/sales/invoicing/invoicing_policy>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} in compliance with [ZATCA's
guidelines](https://zatca.gov.sa/en/E-Invoicing/Introduction/Guidelines/Documents/E-Invoicing_Detailed__Guideline.pdf).

### Retention {#localizations/saudi-arabia/retention}

Retention is an amount temporarily held by the customer, defined by the
commercial contract, to ensure the quality and completion of the work.
It is usually a percentage of the invoice value (e.g., 5-10%) and serves
as security against future defects; it is ultimately paid back to the
contractor once the warranty period expires.

For ZATCA, the commonly applied rule is that VAT is calculated based on
the full invoice amount, even if the customer withholds a portion as
retention. ZATCA advises taxpayers to first determine the tax position,
specifically whether the retention amount reduces the taxable amount or
not. Tax position depends on contractual terms.

The Odoo retention workflow ensures, through tax position, that the
retention amount does not reduce the taxable amount.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Any negative tax (e.g., -20%) configured with the
`Is Retention`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox enabled has
no impact on the UBL 2.1. It only applies when this retention tax is

separate negative invoice line with a 0%
(`Not Subject to VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) tax rate at
the invoice level, usually indicates that VAT has been paid on the full
taxable amount. Therefore, the final invoice for releasing the retention
amount does not qualify as a `Tax Invoice`{.interpreted-text

These steps ensure that each receipt is processed as a compliant
e-invoice and reported to the ZATCA portal in real time. Once the
receipt is generated, the Phase 2 QR code automatically appears on both
the printed receipt and the PDF.

`Spain - Facturae EDI (l10n_es_edi_facturae)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} module and other **Facturae EDI**-related modules.

To configure FACe, follow these steps:

1.  Go to
    `Accounting --> Configuration --> Certificates`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
2.  Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a new
    certificate.
3.  Complete the fields, including uploading the file of the
    `Certificate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} provided by the tax
    agency and the provided `Certificate Password`{.interpreted-text

::::

### Use case

Once you have
`created <../../finance/accounting/customer_invoices>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} an invoice and confirmed it, click
`Send & Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Make sure
`Generate Facturae edi file`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is

### Administrative centers

In order for **FACe** to work with **administrative centers**, the
invoice *must* include specific data about the centers.

To add **administrative centers**, create a new **contact** to add to
the **partner** company. Select `FACe Center`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} as the **type**, assign one or more **role(s)** to that
contact, and `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The **three**
roles usually required are:

- Órgano gestor: `Receptor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  (Receiver);
- Unidad tramitadora: `Pagador`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  (Payer);
- Oficina contable: `Fiscal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  (Fiscal).

![Administrative center contact form for public entities.](spain/administrative-center.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- If administrative centers need different `Codes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} per role, you *must* create different centers for each
role. - When an electronic invoice is created using a partner with
**administrative centers**, *all* administrative centers are included in
the invoice. - You can add one contact with multiple roles or multiple
contacts with a different role each.

# Switzerland

## ISR (In-payment Slip with Reference number)

The ISRs are payment slips used in Switzerland. You can print them
directly from Odoo. On the customer invoices, there is a new button
called *Print ISR*.

![image](switzerland/switzerland00.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The button *Print ISR* only appears there is well a bank account defined
on the invoice. You can use CH6309000000250097798 as bank account number
and 010391391 as CHF ISR reference.
::::

![image](switzerland/switzerland01.png){.align-center}

Then you open a pdf with the ISR.

![image](switzerland/switzerland02.png){.align-center}

There exists two layouts for ISR: one with, and one without the bank
coordinates. To choose which one to use, there is an option to print the
bank information on the ISR. To activate it, go in
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and enable **Print bank on ISR**:

![image](switzerland/switzerland03.png){.align-center}

### ISR reference on invoices

To ease the reconciliation process, you can add your ISR reference as
**Payment Reference** on your invoices.

To do so, you need to configure the Journal you usually use to issue
invoices. Go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, open the Journal you want to modify (By default,
the Journal is named *Customer Invoices*), click en *Edit*, and open the
*Advanced Settings* tab. In the **Communication Standard** field, select
*Switzerland*, and click on *Save*.

![Configure your Journal to display your ISR as payment reference on your invoices in Odoo](switzerland/switzerland-isr-reference.png){.align-center}

## Currency Rate Live Update

You can update automatically your currencies rates based on the Federal
Tax Administration from Switzerland. For this, go in
`Accounting --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
activate the multi-currencies setting and choose the service you want.

![image](switzerland/switzerland04.png){.align-center}

## Updated VAT for January 2018

Starting from the 1st January 2018, new reduced VAT rates will be
applied in Switzerland. The normal 8.0% rate will switch to 7.7% and the
specific rate for the hotel sector will switch from 3.8% to 3.7%.

### How to update your taxes in Odoo Enterprise (Odoo Online or On-premise)?

If you have the V11.1 version, all the work is already been done, you
don\'t have to do anything.

If you have started on an earlier version, you first have to update the
module \"Switzerland - Accounting Reports\". For this, you go in
`Apps --> remove the filter "Apps" --> search for "Switzerland - Accounting Reports" --> open the module --> click on "upgrade"`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![image](switzerland/switzerland05.png){.align-center}

Once it has been done, you can work on creating new taxes for the
updated rates.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

**Do not suppress or modify the existing taxes** (8.0% and 3.8%). You
want to keep them since you may have to use both rates for a short
period of time. Instead, remember to archive them once you have encoded
all your 2017 transactions.
::::

The creation of such taxes should be done in the following manner:

- **Purchase taxes**: copy the origin tax, change its name, label on
  invoice, rate and tax group (effective from v10 only)
- **Sale taxes**: copy the origin tax, change its name, label on
  invoice, rate and tax group (effective from v10 only). Since the vat
  report now shows the details for old and new rates, you should also
  set the tags accordingly to
  - For 7.7% taxes: Switzerland VAT Form: grid 302 base, Switzerland VAT
    Form: grid 302 tax
  - For 3.7% taxes: Switzerland VAT Form: grid 342 base, Switzerland VAT
    Form: grid 342 tax

You\'ll find below, as examples, the correct configuration for all taxes
included in Odoo by default

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Tax Name**    **Rate**   **Label on  **Tax Group  **Tax       **Tag**
                             Invoice**   (effective   Scope**

# Thailand

## Configuration

`Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
`🇹🇭 Thailand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} localization package to
get all the features of the Thai localization:

  Name                                                                 Technical name                  Description

  `Thailand - Accounting Reports`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}   [l10n_th_reports]{.title-ref}   Country-specific accounting reports

![Thailand localization modules](thailand/modules.png)

## Chart of accounts and taxes

Odoo\'s fiscal localization package for Thailand includes the following
taxes:

- VAT 7%
- VAT-exempted
- Withholding tax
- Withholding income tax

## Tax report

Odoo allows users to generate Excel files to submit their VAT to the
**Revenue Department** of Thailand.

### Sales and purchase tax report

To generate a sales and purchase tax report, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax
Report`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Select a specific time
or time range on the tax report, and click
`VAT-202-01 (xlsx)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for purchase tax
and `VAT-202-02 (xlsx)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for sales
tax.

![Thai purchase and sales taxes reports](thailand/tax-report.png)

### Withholding PND tax report

PND report data displays the summarized amounts of the applicable
**withholding corporate income tax returns (domestic)** from vendor
bills under the `PND53 (TH)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`PND3 (TH)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tax reports. It is
installed by default with the Thai localization.

![PND tax reports](thailand/pnd-report.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Withholding corporate income tax returns (domestic) is the tax used in
case the company has withheld the tax from "**Personal (PND3)**" or
"**Corporate (PND53)**" services provided such as rental, hiring,
transportation, insurance, management fee, consulting, etc.
::::

The PND tax report allows users to generate a CSV file for bills to
upload on the [RDprep for Thailand e-Filling
application](https://efiling.rd.go.th/rd-cms/).

To generate a PND CSV file, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select a specific time or time range on the tax
report, and click `PND3`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`PND53`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

This generates the `Tax Report PND3.csv`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
and `Tax Report PND53.csv`{.interpreted-text role="file"} files that
lists all the vendor bill lines with the applicable withholding tax.

![PND3 and PND53 CSV files](thailand/pnd3-pnd53.png)

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Odoo cannot generate the PND or PDF report or **withholding tax
certificate** directly. The generated
`Tax Report PND3.csv`{.interpreted-text role="file"} and
`Tax Report PND53.csv`{.interpreted-text role="file"} files must be
exported to an external tool to convert them into a **withholding PND**
report or a **PDF** file.
::::

## Tax invoice

The **tax invoice PDF** report can be generated from Odoo through the
**Invoicing** module. Users have the option to print PDF reports for
normal invoices and tax invoices. To print out **tax invoices**, users
can click on `Print Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
Odoo. Regular invoices can be printed as **commercial invoices** by
clicking on `Cog button (⚙️) --> Print -->
Commercial Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

![Commercial invoice printing](thailand/tax-invoice.png)

### Headquarter/Branch number settings

You can inform a company\'s **Headquarters** and **Branch number** in
the **Contacts** app. Once in the app, open the **contact form** of the
company and under the `Sales & Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab:

- If the contact is identified as a branch, input the **Branch number**
  in the `Company ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
- If the contact is a **Headquarters**, leave the
  `Company ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field **blank**.

This information is used in the **tax invoice** PDF report and PND **tax
report** export.

## PromptPay QR code on invoices

The **PromptPay QR code** is a QR code that can be added to invoices to
allow customers to pay their bills using the PromptPay-supported bank
mobile application. The QR code is generated based on the **invoice
amount** and one of the following **merchant information**:

- Ewallet ID
- Merchant Tax ID
- Mobile Number

### Activate QR codes

Go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Under the `Customer
Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, activate the
`QR Codes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature.

### PromptPay QR bank account configuration

Go to `Contacts --> Configuration --> Bank Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the bank account for which you want to
activate PromptPay QR. Set the `Proxy Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and fill in the `Proxy Value`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field depending on the chosen type.

role="menuselection"}, open the bank journal, then fill in the
`Account Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under the
`Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![Bank Account\'s journal configuration](thailand/qr-bank-journal.png)

### Issue invoices with PromptPay QR code

When creating a new invoice, open the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab and set the `Payment
QR-code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option to
`EMV Merchant-Presented QR-code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Select EMV Merchant-Presented QR-code option](thailand/qr-code-invoice-emv.png)

Ensure that the `Recipient Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
the one you configured, as Odoo uses this field to generate the
PromptPay QR code.

## Localization overview {#localizations/uae/loc-review}

The UAE fiscal localisation provides a fully configured accounting setup
aligned with national VAT and corporate tax regulations. It includes a
localised chart of accounts, VAT-compliant tax groups, standard
journals, fiscal year configurations, and reporting features that ensure
accuracy and compliance with the Federal Tax Authority (FTA).

The UAE localization package provides the following key features to
ensure compliance with local fiscal and accounting regulations:

- `Chart of accounts <localizations/uae/coa>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: a predefined structure aligned with UEA accounting
  standards
- `Taxes <localizations/uae/taxes>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:
  preconfigured tax groups and templates based on UAE VAT rules
- `../accounting/taxes/fiscal_positions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}:
  automated tax adjustments to handle local and cross-border
  transactions
- `VAT return <localizations/uae/tax-return>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: structured according to the UAE VAT return format, as
  issued by the `FTA (Federal Tax Authority)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"}
- `Corporate Tax Report <localizations/uae/corporate-tax-report>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: structured according to the UAE Corporate Tax Report, as
  issued by the `FTA (Federal Tax Authority)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"}

### Chart of accounts {#localizations/uae/coa}

The UAE
`chart of accounts <../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is aligned with
`IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and `FTA (Federal Tax Authority)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} tax requirements. This includes classified accounts for
assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses, as well as separate
accounts for VAT payable and VAT receivable.

This structure ensures compatibility with UAE reporting obligations,
VAT, and corporate income tax filings.

### Taxes {#localizations/uae/taxes}

The UAE localization includes preconfigured VAT rates and
`taxes <../accounting/taxes>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} as defined
by the `FTA (Federal Tax Authority)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}:

- | Standard VAT (5%): The prevailing VAT rate applied to most taxable
    goods and services supplied within the UAE.
  | The supplier charges 5% VAT on the sale (Output VAT). VAT-registered
    businesses may generally recover the VAT paid on eligible business
    purchases (Input VAT).

  ::: example
  Most commercial sales, retail goods, telecommunication services,
  non-exempt private education, and non-exempt private healthcare.
  :::

- | Zero-Rated VAT (0%): Taxable supplies on which VAT is applied at a
    rate of 0%.
  | No VAT is collected on the sale, but the supplier remains fully
    entitled to recover input VAT related to making these supplies.

  ::: example
  - Exports of goods and services (subject to qualifying conditions)
  - International transport and related services
  - Designated sectors such as specific healthcare and education
    services
  - First supply of residential property (subject to conditions)
  :::

- | Exempt VAT: Supplies that fall outside the taxable category and are
    not subject to VAT.
  | The supplier does not charge VAT and cannot recover input VAT on
    costs related to exempt activities.

  ::: example
  \- Financial services: Interest on loans, bank account operations, and
  life insurance (when no explicit fee is charged).
  - Local passenger transport: Taxis, buses, metro services, and
    domestic flights within the UAE.
  :::

- | Import VAT: VAT that is applied to goods imported into the UAE.
  | Import VAT is recorded at the applicable rate (generally 5%). In UAE
    VAT reporting, only the VAT amount is declared; the import base
    amount is not required in the tax report.
  | Applied when recording customs-import transactions or imports
    recognized through the VAT return.

- | Out of Scope: Transactions that fall outside the scope of UAE VAT
    legislation.

  ::: example
  - Transactions entirely outside the UAE
  - Internal accounting adjustments
  - Certain government-mandated transfers
  :::

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  These taxes can be applied directly to products or managed dynamically
  through fiscal positions.
  ::::

#### Reverse charge mechanism (RCM) {#localizations/uae/reverse-charge-mechanism}

- Description: Mechanism that transfers the obligation to account for
  VAT from the non-resident supplier to the UAE VAT-registered
  recipient.
- Mechanism: The recipient declares VAT as both output VAT and input VAT
  in the VAT return. This typically results in a net-zero impact when
  fully recoverable.
- Application: Commonly used for imported services and cross-border B2B
  transactions where the supplier has no UAE VAT registration.

### VAT return (VAT201) {#localizations/uae/tax-return}

The UAE
`VAT Return report <accounting/tax-returns/vat-report>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} includes:

- Output VAT
- Input VAT
- Reverse charge VAT
- Zero-rated and exempt sales

> :::: note
> ::: title
> Note
> :::
>
> The report structure follows the official
> `FTA (Federal Tax Authority)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} format
> and can be exported in both Excel and PDF formats for manual
> submission.
> ::::

### Corporate tax report {#localizations/uae/corporate-tax-report}

The UAE Corporate Tax Report helps companies prepare for compliance with
local corporate tax regulations. The report is found under
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Corporate Tax
Report`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and includes:

- Net profit
- Exempt income
- Allowable deductions
- Adjustments for non-deductible (disallowed) expenses
- Corporate tax amount

As part of this report, users can set `exempt income
<localizations/uae/exempt-income-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `allowable deductions
<localizations/uae/allowable-deductions-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and `disallowed expenses accounts
<localizations/uae/disallowed-expenses>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

No default fiscal categories, disallowed expenses, allowable deduction
accounts, or exempt income accounts are configured. Users must classify
them manually according to their tax situation.
::::

#### Exempt income accounts {#localizations/uae/exempt-income-accounts}

Exempt income generally refers to revenue that is not subject to
corporate tax under UAE rules. Examples may include:

- Dividends received from qualifying shareholdings
- Capital gains on the sale of qualifying shares

To classify exempt income, navigate to the `chart of accounts
<../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, open the relevant account, and assign the tag
`Corporate Tax Report – Exempted Income Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Tagging these accounts ensures that exempt income is
reported accurately without being included in the taxable base.

#### Allowable deductions accounts {#localizations/uae/allowable-deductions-accounts}

Allowable deductions are expenses that are incurred solely for business
purposes. Examples include:

- Employee salaries and benefits
- Office rent, utilities, and professional services

To classify allowable deductions, navigate to the `chart of accounts
<../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, open the relevant expense account, and assign the tag
`Corporate Tax Report – Allowable Deductions Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Tagging these accounts ensures that they effectively
reduce taxable profits.

#### Disallowed expenses {#localizations/uae/disallowed-expenses}

Some expenses are not deductible for corporate tax purposes. Examples
include:

- Fines and penalties (e.g., traffic or administrative violations)
- Non-business or personal expenses
- Excessive entertainment costs beyond permitted limits
- Certain related-party costs that do not meet transfer-pricing
  requirements

To configure these expenses, navigate to the `chart of accounts
<../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, open the relevant account, and assign a fiscal category.
Then, in the `Fiscal Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
configure the start date and the fiscal rate.

### Automatic currency rates {#localizations/uae/automatic-currency-rates}

The UAE localization includes automatic synchronization of foreign
`currency rates
<multi-currency/config-rates>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} through a
built-in connection with the Central Bank of the UAE. Exchange rates are
retrieved
`automatically <multi-currency/automatic-update>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and applied across transactions when the
`Automatic Currency Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is
enabled.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Rates are updated automatically, but can also be `manually updated
<multi-currency/manual-update>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} when
necessary.
::::

## Invoicing language {#localizations/uae/invoicing-language}

Invoices can be issued in different languages to meet regional or
customer-specific requirements at two levels:

- Customer level: To assign a preferred language to a customer, go to
  `Accounting -->
  Customers --> Customers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} or
  `Point of Sale --> Orders --> Customers`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}, and open the relevant customer form. In the
  `Language`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, update the
  language preference. All documents for that customer are then
  automatically generated in the selected language.

- Company level: To add Arabic as a secondary language to meet business
  needs:

  - For `Tax Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Go to
    `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}, in the `Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} section.
  - For Point of Sale receipts: Go to
    `Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}, and navigate to the
    `Bills & Receipts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

  Then, enable the `Gulf Cooperation Council Format`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} option, and `Save`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.

## Invoice types {#localizations/uae/invoice-types}

The type of invoice to be issued depends on the following criteria:

- `Tax Invoices (B2B)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A
  `Tax Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, used for
  business-to-business transactions, contains all the details required
  for VAT recovery, including the supplier and customer legal names,
  addresses, `TRN (Tax Registration Number)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} numbers (where applicable), itemized VAT amounts, and
  total amounts. This is the standard document required when a customer
  intends to reclaim VAT.
- `Simplified Tax Invoices (B2C)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A
  `Simplified Tax Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
  primarily used for business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions, where the
  customer is not expected to reclaim VAT. It contains reduced customer
  information (customer
  `TRN (Tax Registration Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is not
  required), focusing instead on supplier details, VAT charged, and the
  total amount payable.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

A `Simplified Tax Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is still a
legally valid tax invoice under VAT law.

### Making Tax Digital (MTD) {#localization/united-kingdom/digital-tax}

In the UK, all VAT-registered businesses have to follow the MTD rules by
using software to submit their VAT returns.

The **UK - Accounting Reports** module enables you to comply with the
[HM Revenue &
Customs](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/)
requirements regarding [Making Tax
Digital](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-tax-digital/overview-of-making-tax-digital/).

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If your periodic submission is more than three months late, it is no
longer possible to submit it through Odoo, as Odoo only retrieves open
bonds from the last three months. Your submission has to be done
manually by contacting HMRC.
::::

#### Register your company to HMRC before the first submission {#localization/united-kingdom/hmrc-registration}

Go to `Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click on `Connect to HMRC`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Enter your company information on the HMRC platform.
You only need to do it once.

#### Periodic submission to HMRC {#localization/united-kingdom/periodic-hmrc-submission}

Import your obligations HMRC, filter on the period you want to submit,
and send your tax report by clicking `Send to HMRC`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip

You can use dummy credentials to demo the HMRC flow. To do so, activate
the `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
go to `General Settings -->
Technical --> System Parameters`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. From here, search for
[l10n_uk_reports.hmrc_mode]{.title-ref} and change the value line to
[demo]{.title-ref}. You can get such credentials from the [HMRC
Developer Hub](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-test-user).
::::

#### Periodic submission to HMRC for multi-company {#localization/united-kingdom/periodic-hmrc-submission-multi}

Only one company and one user can connect to HMRC simultaneously. If
several UK-based companies are on the same database, the user who
submits the HMRC report must follow these instructions before each
submission:

1.  Log into the company for which the submission has to be done.
2.  Go to `General Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and in
    the `Users`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, click
    `Manage Users`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Select the user
    who is connected to HMRC.
3.  Go to the `UK HMRC Integration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    tab and click `Reset Authentication
    Credentials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `Remove Authentication Credentials`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} button.
4.  `Register your company to HMRC <localization/united-kingdom/hmrc-registration>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and submit the company\'s tax report.
5.  Repeat the steps for other companies\' HMRC submissions.

## Bacs files {#localization/united-kingdom/BACS-files}

`Bacs (Bankers' Automated Clearing Services)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} files are electronic files used in the UK to process
payments and transfers between bank accounts.

To enable the use of Bacs files, make sure the
`UK BACS Payment Files <localization/united-kingdom/modules>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} module is installed, then:

1.  Configure your Bacs Service User Number:
    1.  Go to
        `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
        role="menuselection"} and scroll down to the
        `Customer Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.
    2.  Enter your `Service User Number`{.interpreted-text
        role="guilabel"} under `BACS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
        and manually save.
2.  Configure your **bank** journal:
    1.  Go to
        `Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
        role="menuselection"} and select your **bank** journal.
    2.  In the `Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
        configure the `Account Number`{.interpreted-text
        role="guilabel"} and `Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
        fields.
    3.  In the `Incoming Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
        and `Outgoing Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tabs,
        make sure the `BACS Direct Debit`{.interpreted-text
        role="guilabel"} payment method is enabled.
3.  Configure the contacts for whom you wish to use Bacs files: Access
    the contact form and, in the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} tab, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} and fill in the `Account Number`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} and `Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    fields.

### Bill payments {#localization/united-kingdom/bill-payments}

To generate Bacs files for bill payments, set the
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`BACS Direct Debit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} when
`registering vendor payments <../accounting/payments>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

Then, create a vendor batch payment:

1.  Go to `Accounting --> Vendors --> Batch Payments`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.
2.  Select the bank journal in the `Bank`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field, set the `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} to `BACS Direct Credit`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, and select a
    `BACS Processing Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
3.  Optionally, you can also:
    - select a `BACS Expiry Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
    - enable `BACS Multi Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
      process the payments on their individual date.
4.  Click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select the
    payments you want to include, click `Select`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, then `Validate`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

Once validated, the Bacs file is available in the chatter. You can also
`Re-generate
Export File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if you need a new Bacs
file for that batch payment.

### Invoice payments {#localization/united-kingdom/invoice-payments}

Before generating Bacs files for invoice payments, you must first create
a **BACS Direct Debit Instruction**: Go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> BACS Direct Debit Instructions`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Select a `Customer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, their `IBAN`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
the `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} you wish to use.

To generate Bacs files for invoice payments, set the
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`BACS Direct Debit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} when
`registering invoice payments <../accounting/payments>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If you register the payment for an invoice linked to a subscription or
via `Accounting --> Customers --> Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, you can select the `BACS
Payment Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:

- `Direct debit-first collection of a series`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"};
- `Direct debit single collection`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
- `Direct debit repeating collection in a series`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"};
- `Direct debit-final collection of a series`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
::::

Then, create a customer batch payment:

1.  Go to
    `Accounting --> Customers --> Batch Payments`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.
2.  Select the bank journal in the `Bank`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field, set the `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} to `BACS Direct Credit`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, and select a
    `BACS Processing Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
3.  Optionally, you can also:
    - select a `BACS Expiry Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
    - enable `BACS Multi Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
      process the payments on their individual date.
4.  Click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select the
    payments you want to include, click `Select`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, then `Validate`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

Once validated, the Bacs file is available in the chatter. You can also
`Re-generate
Export File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if you need a new Bacs
file for that batch payment.

::: {#localization/united-kingdom/cis-deduction}
:::

## CIS deduction

The Construction Industry Scheme deduction (CIS deduction) is a tax
deduction system used in the UK designed specifically for the
construction industry. It requires contractors to deduct a percentage of
payments made to subcontractors and forward these deductions to HM
Revenue and Customs (HMRC). These deductions apply only to the labor
portion of the payments and serve as advance payments towards the
subcontractor\'s tax and National Insurance contributions. Contractors
are required to register for the scheme, but subcontractors are not.
However, subcontractors who are not registered face higher payment
deductions. Under the
`CIS (Construction Industry Scheme)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
contractors must deduct 20% from payments to registered subcontractors,
while the deduction increases to 30% for unregistered ones.

  (CIS)](https://www.gov.uk/what-is-the-construction-industry-scheme)

- [Guidelines for CIS
  subcontractors](https://www.gov.uk/what-you-must-do-as-a-cis-subcontractor)
:::

As a contractor, you are required to register with the
`CIS (Construction Industry Scheme)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
before hiring subcontractors and to check whether each subcontractor is
registered with the
`CIS (Construction Industry Scheme)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. You
must also maintain records of all payments and deductions and submit
monthly returns to HMRC, including the following details:

- information about the subcontractors
- records of payments made and any deductions applied
- a declaration confirming that the employment status of all
  subcontractors has been reviewed
- a declaration confirming that all subcontractors requiring
  verification have been verified

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If no payments were made to subcontractors in the previous tax month,
contractors must notify
`HMRC (HM Revenue and Customs)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by the
19th of the month to avoid a penalty.

`Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from [production]{.title-ref}
to [test]{.title-ref}.
::::

### Monthly returns {#localization/united-kingdom/cis-monthly-returns}

Monthly returns only work for vendor bills and vendor refunds. To submit
a complete return to `HMRC (HM Revenue and Customs)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, several steps must be followed to report all payments made
to subcontractors under the scheme during the previous tax month:

- `localization/united-kingdom/cis-contractor-setup`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `localization/united-kingdom/cis-subcontractor-setup`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `localization/united-kingdom/cis-vendorbills`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `localization/united-kingdom/cis-monthly-return-sending`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}

#### Contractor (company) setup {#localization/united-kingdom/cis-contractor-setup}

To configure your company\'s
`HMRC (HM Revenue and Customs)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
information, go to the Settings app and, in the
`Companies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, click
`Update Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Open the
`HMRC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and configure the
information in the `HMRC Credentials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and the `Contractor details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
sections. All fields are mandatory.

#### Subcontractor setup {#localization/united-kingdom/cis-subcontractor-setup}

Access the subcontractor\'s contact form and select the
`Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. In the
`HMRC Details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, enable the
`Construction Industry Scheme`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option; the `CIS (Construction Industry Scheme)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}-related fields are displayed.

By default, the `Deduction rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
set to 30%. To modify it, first enter the
`Verification Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} provided by
`HMRC (HM Revenue and Customs)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} when
verifying the subcontractor\'s status, then update the
`Deduction Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} accordingly.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Forename`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Surname`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields are mandatory if the
contact type is set to `Individual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

#### Vendor bills {#localization/united-kingdom/cis-vendorbills}

The appropriate `CIS (Construction Industry Scheme)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} tax must be applied to **labor items** on vendor bills
based on the subcontractor\'s `Deduction Rate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}: `0% CIS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`20% CIS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`30% CIS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To apply the rate, go to
the `Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
vendor bill and select the appropriate
`CIS (Construction Industry Scheme)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} tax
rate in the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column of the
**labor** items.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- The `CIS (Construction Industry Scheme)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} tax rate is not necessary for material items on vendor
bills. - A yellow banner appears at the top of the page if:

- The `Construction Industry Scheme`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  option hasn\'t been enabled in the
  `subcontractor <localization/united-kingdom/cis-subcontractor-setup>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}\'s `Contact`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form when
  creating a vendor bill.
- The `CIS (Construction Industry Scheme)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} tax used in the vendor bill does not match the expected
  `CIS (Construction Industry Scheme)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  deduction rate for a
  `subcontractor <localization/united-kingdom/cis-subcontractor-setup>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

#### Monthly returns sending {#localization/united-kingdom/cis-monthly-return-sending}

On the 6th of each month, Odoo sends a reminder email to submit a
monthly return to `HMRC (HM Revenue and Customs)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. The recipient email address is the one entered in the
company `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. To send
monthly returns to `HMRC (HM Revenue and Customs)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Return`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and follow these steps:

1.  Click `fa-book`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    `Report:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select
    `CIS Deduction (GB)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
2.  In the `fa-calendar`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    `(calendar)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} date selector, the
    `Tax Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is automatically
    adjusted to match the
    `CIS (Construction Industry Scheme)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
    deduction period.
3.  Click on `Send to HMRC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
    top-left corner.
4.  In the `CIS monthly return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    window, select the required options in the
    `Declaration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section:
    - `Employment Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: To declare
      that the employment status of all subcontractors has been
      reviewed.
    - `Subcontractor Verification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
      To declare that all submitted subcontractors requiring
      verification have been verified.
    - `Inactivity Indicator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: To
      declare temporary inactivity.
5.  In the `Information correct declaration`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} section, confirm the information is true and
    complete by checking the box. Then, enter the
    `Password`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} used in the
    `HMRC Credentials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section during
    `contractor setup <localization/united-kingdom/cis-contractor-setup>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
6.  Click `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to prompt Odoo to
    request `HMRC (HM Revenue and Customs)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} to initiate the transaction.

When `HMRC (HM Revenue and Customs)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
replies to a transaction, Odoo automatically notifies the user who
submitted it by email. The email informs them that the response is
available in the company\'s chatter with an attached XML document for
download. Both the electronic and paper versions of the
`HMRC (HM Revenue and Customs)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} receipt
should be retained. If an error is detected, a new submission is
required to comply with
`HMRC (HM Revenue and Customs)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
requirements.

# United States

The Odoo fiscal localization package for the United States follows the
Generally Acceptable Accounting Principles (GAAP) accounting standards
and rules used to prepare financial statements, as outlined by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and adopted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

(FASB)](https://asc.fasb.org/Home) - [Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC)](https://www.sec.gov/)
:::

In addition, a series of videos on the subject of Accounting are
available through Odoo\'s eLearning platform. These videos cover how to
start from scratch, set up configurations, complete common workflows,
and provide in-depth looks at some specific use cases, as well.

States.

Note
:::

The modules listed below are either for reference only or are optional,
as the core requirements to operate under the US fiscal localization in
Odoo are already included under the default package that came installed
during database initialization.

Verify the default package is in use by navigating to
`Accounting App -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and under the
`Fiscal Localization`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section at the
top, look for the [Generic Chart Template]{.title-ref} selection to be
listed next to the `Package`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
label. This chart template includes the necessary settings for the US
localization for the Odoo **Accounting** app.

## Chart of accounts {#l10n_us/coa}

The
`chart of accounts (COA) <../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for the United States localization, in Odoo, follows the
standard
`GAAP (Generally Acceptable Accounting Practices)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} structure, with accounts grouped into seven main
categories, with corresponding numeric values that prefix individual
journal entries:

- **Receivable**: the balance of money (or credit) due to the business
  for goods or services delivered or used, but not yet paid for by
  customers. `AR (Accounts Receivable)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  is indicated by the journal code labeled (or beginning) with
  `1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- **Payable**: the business\'s short-term obligations owed to its
  creditors or suppliers, which have not yet been paid.
  `AP (Accounts Payable)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is indicated by
  the journal code labeled (or beginning) with `2`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- **Equity**: the amount of money that is returned to a company\'s
  shareholders if all of the assets were liquidated and all of the
  company\'s debt was paid off in the case of liquidation. Equity is
  indicated by the journal code labeled (or beginning) with
  `3`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `9`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- **Assets**: items listed on the balance sheet that contains economic
  value or have the ability to generate cash flows in the future, such
  as a piece of machinery, a financial security, or a patent. Assets are
  indicated by the journal code labeled (or beginning) with
  `1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- **Liability**: refers to a company\'s financial debts or obligations
  that arise during the course of business operations. Liabilities are
  indicated by the journal code labeled (or beginning) with
  `2`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- **Income**: synonymous with *net income*, this is the profit a company
  retains after paying off all relevant expenses from sales revenue
  earned. Income is indicated by the journal code labeled (or beginning)
  with `4`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `6`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- **Expenses**: the cost of operations that a company incurs to generate
  revenue. Expenses are indicated by the journal code labeled (or
  beginning) with a `6`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### View, edit, and sort accounts

Access the *Chart of Accounts* dashboard in Odoo by navigating to
`Accounting app -->
Configuration --> Accounting: Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

From the `Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
dashboard, create new accounts by clicking the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the top-left corner of the dashboard and
`filling in the
corresponding form <chart-of-account/create>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Search and sort through existing accounts by using specific
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} criteria, which are
available in the search drop-down menu.

To filter accounts by category, click the
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(dropdown)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to access the
drop-down menu and look under the `Filters`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column for individual selections. Clicking on a
specific category will only show accounts that match that particular
filter.

To view all the available account types, remove all of the filters in
the search bar, and then click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(dropdown)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to
access the drop-down menu. From there, select
`Account Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under the
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column heading to list all
of the account types in the table.

![Chart of Accounts grouped by Account Type.](united_states/us-l10n-coa-account-types.png)

Besides structure, there are other key differences in the chart of
accounts in the United States, compared to other countries:

- **Specificity**: US
  `GAAP (Generally Acceptable Accounting Practices)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} often requires more detailed accounts compared to some
  other countries. This can include separate accounts for various types
  of revenue, expenses, and assets, providing more granular information
  in financial reports.
- **Regulatory Requirements**: In the United States, there are specific
  regulatory requirements set by bodies such as the
  `SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} for publicly traded companies. These requirements may
  influence the structure and content of the
  `CoA (Chart of Accounts)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to ensure
  compliance with reporting standards.
- **Industry Practices**: Certain industries in the United States may
  have unique accounting requirements or specialized
  `CoA (Chart of Accounts)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} structures.
  For example, financial institutions often have specific accounts
  related to loans, investments, and interest income.
- **Tax Considerations**: The
  `CoA (Chart of Accounts)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} may also
  reflect tax considerations, such as accounts for deductible expenses,
  deferred tax assets, and liabilities, to ensure compliance with tax
  laws and facilitate tax reporting.

These differences, ultimately, should be reflected in the
`CoA (Chart of Accounts)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} structure
itself, with the addition of new accounts, as needed, in order to meet
the demands of US accounting reporting requirements.

## Taxes {#l10n_us/taxes}

In the United States, tax rates and what is considered taxable vary by
jurisdiction. Default *sales* and *purchase* taxes are created
automatically when the Odoo **Accounting** app is installed. To manage
existing or configure additional taxes, navigate to `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

### AvaTax {#l10n_us/taxes-avatax}

**Avalara AvaTax** is a cloud-based tax calculation and compliance
software that integrates with Odoo for several localizations.
Integrating AvaTax with Odoo provides real-time and region-specific tax
calculations when items are sold, purchased, and invoiced in the
database.

## Reports {#l10n_us/reports}

A number of
`report selections <../accounting/reporting>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} are readily available for the US localization, under the
`Accounting app --> Reporting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
drop-down menu:

- `Balance Sheet <accounting/reporting/balance-sheet>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: a \"snapshot\" of a company\'s financial position at a
  specific point in time, which contains an overview of a company\'s
  assets, liabilities, and equity.
- `Profit & Loss <accounting/reporting/balance-sheet>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: otherwise known as a *P&L statement* or *income
  statement*, provides a summary of a company\'s revenues, expenses, and
  profits/losses over a given period of time.
- `Cash Flow Statement <l10n_us/cash-flow-statement>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: shows how much cash and cash equivalents a company has
  received and spent in a given period.
- `Executive Summary <accounting/reporting/executive-summary>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: an overview report that covers the key performance
  indicators of a company\'s financial position, such as revenue,
  profit, and debt.
- `Tax Report <accounting/reporting/tax-report>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: an official form filed for a tax authority that reports
  income, expenses, and other pertinent tax information. Tax reports
  allow taxpayers to calculate their tax liability, schedule tax
  payments, or request refunds for the overpayment of taxes. In Odoo,
  the tax report can be made monthly, every two months, quarterly, every
  4 months, semi-annually, and annually.
- `Check Register`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a report that
  displays cash transactions (regardless of the journal) with their
  running balance after the transaction. Only visible with the *US -
  Accounting Reports* ([l10n_us_reports]{.title-ref}) module installed.
- `1099 Report <l10n_us/1099-report>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}: a
  CSV download of payments made to non-employees in a period to file
  electronically in a third-party service. Only visible with the *1099
  Reporting* ([l10n_us_1099]{.title-ref}) module installed.

::: {#l10n_us/report-filters}
Depending on the type of report, certain filters are available at the
top of the dashboard:
:::

- a *date* filter, indicated by a `fa-calendar`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} `(calendar)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon that
  precedes a date in *MM/DD/YYYY* format. Use this to select a specific
  date or date range for the report.
- a `fa-bar-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Comparison`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter, to compare
  reporting periods against each other
- a *journal* filter, as indicated by a `fa-book`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} `(book)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and the
  default setting of `All Journals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  Use this filter to specify which journals should be included in the
  report.
- an *entries type* filter, as indicated by a
  `fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(filter)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, with the default
  setting of `Posted Entries Only, Accrual Basis`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. Use this filter to determine which type of journal
  entries should be included in the report (e.g. posted or draft), along
  with the type of accounting method (e.g. accrual or cash basis).
  - There are view options in this filter, as well, one that will
    `Hide lines at 0`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for more
    relevant viewing, along with a
    `Split Horizontally`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option to
    keep the report above the screen\'s fold, removing the need to
    scroll.

    ![Accounting method filter menu for reports, covering accrual vs. cash basis methods.](united_states/us-l1on-accounting-method-reporting-menu.png)
- a *decimal* filter, that by default, includes figures with cents, as
  indicated by the `In .$`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting.
  Use the other options in the drop-down menu to change figures in the
  report to whole numbers (`In $`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}),
  thousands (`In K$`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), or millions
  (`In M$`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) formats.
- a report *customization* filter, indicated by the
  `fa-cogs`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(gears)`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} icon. Use this filter to customize the current
  report\'s sections and line items, or build new reports, as desired.

### 1099 report {#l10n_us/1099-report}

The 1099 report, available by
`installing <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the *1099
Reporting* ([l10n_us_1099]{.title-ref}) module, includes payments that
are made to non-employees across a given reporting period. Use the
available CSV download from the report in Odoo to file 1099 payments
electronically via a third-party service.

To generate a 1099 report, navigate to
`Accounting app --> Reporting --> Management:
1099 Report`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} to open a
`1099 Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} wizard.

First, enter the date range of the transactions to report in the
`Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields.

Then, edit the journal items that appear on the wizard. Click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add any items that
are missing. Be sure to remove any items that should not be included in
the report by clicking `fa-times`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(delete)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the row.

Finally, once all necessary items are included in the 1099 report, click
on the `Generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. Doing so
downloads a CSV file that groups transactions by the partner that
received the payments.

### Cash flow statement {#l10n_us/cash-flow-statement}

Navigate to the *Cash Flow Statement* (CFS) dashboard by going to
`Accounting app -->
Reporting --> Statement Reports: Cash Flow Statement`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. From here,
`CFS (Cash Flow Statement)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} reports can
be generated using the various
`filters <l10n_us/report-filters>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} that
are available at the top of the dashboard.

Odoo uses the *direct* cash flow method to compile cash flow statements,
which measures actual cash inflows and outflows from the company\'s
operations, such as when cash is received from customers or when cash
payments are made to suppliers.

By default, an account labeled with any of the three default
`Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
`Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard is
included in the report, which includes:
`Operating Activities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Financing Activities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Investing &
Extraordinary Activities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Examples of tagged accounts that are included in the Cash Flow Statement in Odoo.](united_states/us-l10n-cash-flow-statement-tags.png)

Additionally, the cash flow statement in Odoo:

- is limited to the *Bank* and *Cash* journals to reflect money coming
  in or out; and
- also contains *Expenses* accounts, to show the counterpart
  transactions versus *Bank* or *Cash* journal entries, while excluding
  `AR (Accounts Receivable)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
  `AP (Accounts Payable)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} activity.

::: example
Create a vendor bill for \$100, as an operating expense (not
`AP (Accounts Payable)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}). Doing so will
**not** reflect a transaction on the cash flow statement. However,
register a corresponding payment for \$100, and the transaction **will**
reflect on the cash flow statement as `Cash paid for operating
activities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Example of a bill registered as an operating expense as part of a cash flow statement.](united_states/us-l10n-operating-expenses-example.png)
:::

## Cash discount {#l10n_us/cash-discount}

Cash discounts can be configured from
`Accounting app --> Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Each payment term can be set up with a cash
discount and reduced tax.

::: seealso
`../accounting/customer_invoices/cash_discounts`{.interpreted-text

## Writing checks {#l10n_us/writing-checks}

Using checks is still a common payment practice in the US. Be sure the
*US Checks Layout* ([l10n_us_check_printing]{.title-ref}) module for the
US localization is `installed <general/install>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

To enable check printing from Odoo, navigate to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and find the
`Vendor Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. From here,
tick the `Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox to reveal
several fields for check configuration.

Select a pre-printed or blank `Check Layout`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu:

- `Print Check (Top) - US`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Print Check (Middle) - US`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Print Check (Bottom) - US`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Print Blank Check (Top) - US`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Print Blank Check (Middle) - US`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Print Blank Check (Bottom) - US`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

Next, choose whether or not to enable the
`Multi-Pages Check Stub`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

Optionally set a `Check Top Margin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Check Left Margin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, if required.

Once all check configurations are complete, `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} the settings.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Pre-printed check formats (non-blank checks) require pre-printed paper
from a third-party vendor. [Pre-printed checks from
checkdepot.net](https://checkdepot.net/collections/odoo-checks) are
recommended.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Use one of the blank check formats to print the information of the check
ad-hoc when needed. This requires the use of both
`MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} ink or toner complying with the standards for check
printing, as well as [check quality
paper](https://checkdepot.net/collections/blank-check-paper/products/top-format-blank-check-paper-cdt164).
Other information, such as the company name, bank account, and check
number, is printed when creating the blank check.

## Payroll {#l10n_us/payroll}

The **Payroll** app is responsible for calculating an employee\'s pay,
taking into account all work, vacation, and sick time, benefits, and
deductions. The **Payroll** app pulls information from the
**Attendances**, **Timesheets**, **Time Off**, **Employees** and
**Expenses** apps, to calculate the worked hours and compensation for
each employee.

When using an external payroll provider, such as *ADP*, it is necessary
to export the various payroll-related data, such as work entries,
repayment of expenses, taxes, commissions, and any other relevant data,
so the data can be uploaded into the payroll provider, who then issues
the actual paychecks or directly deposits the funds into an employee\'s
bank account.

In order to export the payroll data, the work entries must first be
validated and correct. Refer to the
`work entries <../../hr/payroll/work_entries>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation for more information regarding validating work
entries.

Once work entries are validated, the information can be
`exported to ADP <l10n_us/adp>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

After payments have been issued to employees, payslips can be processed
into batches, validated, and posted to the corresponding accounting
journals to keep all financial records in Odoo current.

### Required information

It is important to have the **Employees** app installed, and all
employee information populated. Several fields in both the
`employee records <l10n_us/payroll-employee-records>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, as well as in an
`employee contracts <l10n_us/payroll-employee-contracts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, are necessary to properly process the employee\'s pay.
Ensure the following fields are filled out in their respective places.

#### Employee records {#l10n_us/payroll-employee-records}

In each employee record, there is various information the **Payroll**
app requires to properly process payslips, including various banking,
tax, and work information.

Navigate to the `Employees app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
and select an employee record to view the sections of the employee form
that directly affect *Payroll*:

- `Work Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:
  - `Work Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: indicates where
    the employee is located, including the state, which affects the tax
    calculations.
  - `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: determines how
    pay is calculated, and determines if an employee earns overtime.
- `Private Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:
  - `SSN No`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the last four digits of
    the employee\'s Social Security Number (SSN) appears on payslips.
  - `Bank Account Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the bank
    account associated with the NACHA payment file.
- `HR Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:
  - `Federal Tax Filing Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
    tax status an employee uses for Payroll tax calculations, which can
    be different from their state status.
  - `State Tax Filing Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
    tax status an employee uses for their state portion of the Payroll
    tax calculation.
  - `W-2 Form`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a US tax form
    indicating the summary of wages, taxes, and benefits paid to an
    employee during a tax period (typically one year).
  - `W-4 Form`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: an IRS form that
    helps outline the amount of federal taxes to withhold for an
    employee, which is paid to the IRS by the company.

#### Employee contracts {#l10n_us/payroll-employee-contracts}

Additionally, there is information that is found in an employee contract
that also affects the **Payroll** app.

Navigate to the
`Employees app --> Employees --> Contracts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select a contract record to view the sections
of a contract that directly affect *Payroll*:

- `General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  - `Salary Structure Type: United States: Employee`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}: defines when the employee is paid, their working
    schedule, and the work entry type.
  - `Work Entry source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: determines
    how work entries are calculated.
- `Salary Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:
  - `SSN No`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the last four digits of
    the employee\'s Social Security Number (SSN) appears on payslips.
  - `Wage type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: determines how the
    employee is paid, wether a Fixed wage (salary) or Hourly wage.
  - `Schedule Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: defines how often
    the employee is paid, either `Annually`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, `Semi-annually`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, `Quarterly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Bi-monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Semi-monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Bi-weekly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Weekly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
    `Daily`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In the US, Semi-monthly
    (24 payments a year) or bi-weekly (26 payments a year) are the most
    common.
  - `Wage, Yearly, and Monthly cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    used to show the total cost of an employee. It is recommended to
    populate the `Yearly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} wage first,
    as it auto-populates the other fields.
  - `Pre-tax benefits`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: populate this
    section according to the employee\'s selections. Pre-tax benefits
    decrease the gross wage, which lowers the base amount that is taxed.
    These are displayed at the beginning of the payslip.
  - `Post-tax benefits`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: these
    benefits are deductions made *after* taxes are calculated. These
    appear towards the end of the payslip before the net amount is
    displayed.

### Export work entries to ADP {#l10n_us/adp}

#### Requirements

In order to create a report that can be uploaded to ADP, there are some
initial configuration steps that must be completed first.

First, ensure the *United States - Payroll - Export to ADP*
([l10n_us_hr_payroll_adp]{.title-ref}) module is
`installed <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Then, the company **must** have an *ADP Code* entered in the company
settings. To do so, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Enter the `ADP Code`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `US Localization`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section.

Next, work entry types **must** have the correct ADP code listed in the
*External Code* field for each work entry type that is being referenced.

Lastly, every employee **must** have an *ADP Code* entered on their
employee form. To do so, navigate to `Employees app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select an employee record, and open the `HR
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Enter the
`ADP Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`ADP Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

The `ADP Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} code is how ADP
identifies that particular employee, and is typically a six-digit
number.

::: seealso
\- `payroll/new-work-entry`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} -
`../../hr/employees/new_employee`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

#### Export data

Once `work entries <../../hr/payroll/work_entries>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} have been verified, the information can be exported to a CSV
file, which can then be uploaded into ADP.

To export the data, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Reporting --> United States: ADP
Export`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, then click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Next, enter the
`Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the work entries using
the calendar pop-over.

Then, enter a `Batch ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
corresponding field. The recommendation for this field is to enter the
date in a [YY-MM-DD]{.title-ref} format, followed by any other
characters to distinguish that specific batch, such as a department
name, or any other defining characteristics for the batch.

Enter a `Batch Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
corresponding field. This should be short and descriptive, but distinct
from the `Batch Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Ensure the correct company populates the `Company`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. Change the selected company with the drop-down
menu, if needed.

Lastly, add the employee\'s work entry information to the list. Click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and an
`Add: Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window loads.
The list can be `filtered
<../../essentials/search>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to find the
employees to add to the list.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Process the data export in multiple groups instead of in one large group
that contains all employees. This helps to meaningfully differentiate
the batches and makes processing more tenable, overall. The most common
ways to group employees is by department, or by wage type (hourly or
salaried).
::::

Select the employees to add to the list by ticking the box to the left
of their name. Once all desired employees have been selected, click the
`Select`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the lower-left
corner, and the employees appear in the list.

To create the CSV file, click the `Generate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the top-left corner.

## ACH - electronic transfers {#l10n_us/ach-electronic-transfers}

Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments are a modern way to transfer
funds electronically between bank accounts, replacing traditional
paper-based methods. `ACH (Automated Clearing House)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} payments are commonly used for direct deposits, bill
payments, and business transactions.

### Receive ACH payments: payment provider integration

`ACH (Automated Clearing House)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} payments
are supported by *Authorize.net* and *Stripe* payment integrations in
Odoo.

### Send payments: NACHA files {#l10n_us/nacha}

Odoo can generate a National Automated Clearing House Association
(NACHA) compatible `ACH (Automated Clearing House)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} file to send to a company\'s bank. For each individual
*Bank* journal that the company wishes to pay vendors with, a
`NACHA (National Automated Clearing House Association)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} configuration section needs to be filled out on the Odoo
database.

#### Configuration

First, navigate to the
`Accounting app --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Open the bank journal and click into the
`Outgoing Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![NACHA (National Automated Clearing House Association) configuration settings on Odoo.](united_states/us-l10n-nacha-settings.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The following
`NACHA (National Automated Clearing House Association)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} configuration information is normally provided by the
company\'s financial institution once they have been approved to send
payments via their account.
::::

Under the section labeled, `NACHA configuration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} are the fields required to generate a
`NACHA (National Automated Clearing House Association)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} compatible
`ACH (Automated Clearing House)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} file to
send to a company\'s bank. First, enter the routing number of the
financial institution in the field labeled,
`Immediate Destination`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This
information is widely available on the Internet and generally varies by
bank location. This number is usually provided during the initial
account setup.

Next, enter the registered name of the financial institution in the
field called, `Destination`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This
information is provided by the bank or credit union.

Following the `Destination`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
the `Immediate Origin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Enter
the 9-digit company ID or Employer Identification Number (EIN) into this
field. This information is provided by the financial institution.

Next, enter the `Company Identification`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} number, which is a 10-digit number made from combining
the 9-digit company ID or Employer Identification Number (EIN), along
with an additional number at the start of the sequence. This number is
often a [1]{.title-ref}. Check with the financial institution should
this first number differ to verify that it is correct, as this number is
provided for `ACH (Automated Clearing House)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} approved accounts.

Enter the `Originating DFI Identification`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} number next, which should contain an assigned 8-digit
number from the financial institution.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Enter the numerical values in this section *exactly* as the company\'s
financial institution (e.g. bank or credit union) has provided them,
otherwise risk failing a successful
`NACHA (National Automated Clearing House Association)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} configuration in Odoo.
::::

![NACHA settings with the standard entry class code drop-down menu highlighted.](united_states/us-l10n-nacha-dropdown.png)

Two options are available for the next field:
`Standard Entry Class Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Select
the drop-down menu to the right of the field and pick either
`Corporate Credit or Debit (CCD)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Prearranged Payment and Deposit (PPD)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Again, this information is provided by the financial
institution. By default
`Corporate Credit or Debit (CCD)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
selected.

Finally, the last option is for
`Generated Balanced Files`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Tick the
checkbox to the right of the field to enable
`Generated Balanced Files`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Consult
the company\'s accountant or financial adviser to make an informed
decision for this field.

Manually save the configuration by clicking the
`fa-cloud-upload`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(cloud upload)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, or navigate
away from this screen to auto-save. The configuration is now complete.

#### Create batch payment {#l10n_us/batch-payment}

Now, record each payment in Odoo using the
`NACHA (National Automated Clearing House Association)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} payment method.

::: seealso
`Register Payments in Odoo <accounting/payments/from-invoice-bill>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
:::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Be aware of the cut-off time for same-day payments. Either the file
needs to have a future date associated with each payment or the file
needs to be sent prior to the cut-off, if the dates included in it match
today\'s date. Consult the financial institution for the exact cut-off
time for their processing of same-day payments.
::::

Once all the payments to be included in the
`NACHA (National Automated Clearing House Association)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} `ACH (Automated Clearing House)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} file have been made, a batch payment needs to be made from
the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Action`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} menu.

To create the batch payments, access the payments page, by navigating to
`Accounting
--> Vendors --> Payments`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Select all the payments that should be included in the
`NACHA (National Automated Clearing House Association)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} `ACH (Automated Clearing House)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} file, by ticking the checkboxes to the far-left of the
rows.

![On the payments screen, the action menu is highlighted with create a batch payment
selected.](united_states/us-l10n-create-batch-payments.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

All payments in the batch **must** share the same
`NACHA (National Automated Clearing House Association)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} payment method.
::::

Next, navigate to the batched payment
(`Accounting --> Vendors --> Batch Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}). Click into the payment recently created and then
click into the `Exported File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
The generated file is listed with the
`Generation Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click the
`fa-download`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(download)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to download the
file.

![The exported file tab highlighted in the batch payment with the download circled.](united_states/us-l10n-batch-file.png)

If any adjustments need to be made, click the
`Re-generate Export File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
recreate a new
`NACHA (National Automated Clearing House Association)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} `ACH (Automated Clearing House)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} file.

## Pay by direct deposit

Direct deposit is an electronic fund transfer primarily used in the
United States, in which money is sent directly to a bank account without
the use of a physical check or manual deposit. Odoo offers direct
deposit through an international money transfer service called
[Wise.com](https://wise.com/).

Wise provides an
`API (Application Programming Interface)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, invoicing tools, and business accounts. Businesses can
send and receive payments using Wise\'s cross-border payment technology
without building everything from scratch.

This feature can be used to pay vendor bills.

### Configuration

#### Wise configuration

Wise configuration involves three main steps: creating a Wise account,
linking a bank account to the Wise account, and generating
`API (Application Programming Interface)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
tokens from the Wise account. These steps are detailed below:

1.  Navigate to [Wise.com](https://wise.com/) and click
    `Sign-Up`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create an account.
2.  Select `Business Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
    finish providing company and personal user details to complete the
    sign-up process.
    i.  Wise may require additional verification documents depending on
        the business type and country. This process can take 1--3
        business days.
3.  Navigate to the account settings by clicking the
    `Company Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the top-right
    corner of the dashboard.
4.  Select
    `Payment Methods --> Connected bank accounts`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and click `Connect
    Your Bank Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
5.  Search for the bank and add the bank account information. This bank
    account will be configured in Odoo as well.
6.  Go to the account settings by clicking the
    `Company Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the top-right
    corner of the dashboard.
7.  Select `Integration and Tools --> API Tokens`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and click `Add new token`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.
8.  Add a description and select `Full Access`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, then click `Create Token`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.
9.  Find the token under `API tokens`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    and click `Reveal key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
10. Copy the token to the clipboard.

#### Odoo configuration

Odoo configuration involves four main steps: installing the Wise module,
adding Wise `API (Application Programming Interface)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} credentials, adding the company bank account, and adding
the vendor bank account. These steps are detailed below:

1.  In the Odoo database, `install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} the `United States - Direct
    Deposit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} module.

    :::: tip
    ::: title
    Tip
    :::

    To see the module in search results, remove the `Apps filter
    <../../general/apps_modules>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} from the
    search bar.
    ::::

2.  Go to
    `Accounting app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and scroll down to the
    `Vendor Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

3.  In the setting for
    `U.S. Direct Deposit (via Wise)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    enter the `Wise API
    token`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} generated in Wise.

4.  Click `fa-plug`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    `Connect to Wise`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to ensure the
    connection is established between the Odoo database and the Wise
    account.

    ![Click the Connect to Wise button to ensure the connection is established between the
    Odoo database and the Wise account.](united_states/connect-to-wise.png)

5.  Create the company and vendor bank accounts:

    a.  Go to the `Contacts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app and
        select the company/vendor\'s contact card.

    b.  Switch to the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
        tab and click on the `Bank accounts`{.interpreted-text
        role="guilabel"} field, then click `Create`{.interpreted-text
        role="guilabel"}.

        ![Click the Bank accounts field, then click Create to enter the bank account details.](united_states/create-bank-account.png)

    c.  Click on the `Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
        then select the bank from the list, or click
        `Search more`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if it\'s not
        visible. If the bank isn\'t listed, click `Create
        new`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to fill out the bank
        details, then click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

        ![Click the Bank accounts field, then select or create the bank.](united_states/bank-information.png)

    d.  Finally, enter the company bank account information (linked in
        Wise) or vendor bank account information, and click
        `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

        i.  The `Bank accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
            in the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
            should now display the newly added bank account.

            ![Enter the company/vendor bank account information, then click Save.](united_states/bank-account-information.png)

    e.  Repeat these steps for the **vendor** bank account.

        :::: important
        ::: title
        Important
        :::

        To avoid errors when initiating payments to the vendor, ensure
        the following:

        - Verify the destination bank account with the vendor, then mark
          it as `Trusted
          <../accounting/payments/trusted_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
          role="doc"}.
        - Select the correct `Bank Account Type`{.interpreted-text
          role="guilabel"} (checking or savings).
        - Select the preferred
          `Direct Deposit Transfer Type`{.interpreted-text
          role="guilabel"} for the vendor/destination account. Pricing
          can be verified directly in Wise.
        - See [Wise US pricing](https://wise.com/us/pricing/business) to
          calculate price by feature & transaction amount; for pricing
          in other countries, select the country at the top of the page.

### Pay vendor bills with direct deposit

After configuring direct deposit in both Wise and Odoo, vendor payments
can be created individually in the Odoo database, batched for transfer,
and then paid in Wise.

1.  `Create vendor bills <accounting/vendor_bills/creation>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
2.  `Pay the vendor bills <../accounting/payments>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} using `U.S. Direct Deposit`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} as the `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} for the transaction.
3.  `Create a batch payment <../accounting/payments/batch>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}. Batch payments can include payments from multiple
    vendors.
4.  Confirm the `Batch Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
    `Outbound`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click `Initiate
    payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Odoo will redirect to
    Wise.
    i.  Sign into the Wise account if needed, and see all the pending
        transactions.
5.  Review the details and confirm the batch number is the same in Odoo
    and Wise.
6.  Click `Pay for this batch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `I've now paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to pay for the
    entire batch.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If pop-ups are blocked in the browser settings, Odoo can\'t redirect to
Wise. Instead, Odoo displays a message stating:

[\"A popup window has been blocked. You may need to change your browser
settings to allow popup windows for this page.\"]{.title-ref}

The payment record is still created in Wise, and can be accessed by
clicking `View
Batch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the batch payment.
::::

### Cancel a batch payment

To cancel a batch payment, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to
    `Accounting --> Vendors --> Batch Payments`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
2.  Select the batch payment to cancel, then click
    `View Batch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Odoo will redirect
    to the batch in Wise. Sign into the Wise account if needed.
3.  Click `Cancel batch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in Wise.

## ISO 20022

ISO 20022 is a global standard for sending financial information between
banks and payment systems using XML files. It can be thought of as a
universal language for money messages.

This standard helps banks all over the world talk to each other in the
same way, or *language*, so information is transferred correctly, making
sending and receiving money faster, clearer, and safer.

In Odoo, ISO 20022 files are generated from
`batch payments <l10n_us/batch-payment>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

### Configurations

Before creating ISO 20022 records, several configurations must be made,
including `general
settings <l10n_us/settings>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, contact
information for the `company
<l10n_us/contact-info-company>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
contact and banking information for all `recipients
<l10n_us/contact-info-recipient>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

#### Settings {#l10n_us/settings}

First, navigate to
`Acounting app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, scroll to the
`Customer Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and
enable the `Batch Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option.

Then scroll to the `Vendor Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section and enable the `SEPA Credit
Transfer / ISO20022`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. Once
Enabled, three fields appear: `Your Company`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Name Identification`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `Issuer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Enter
the information for these fields. The information entered is required by
the bank to identify the account, and is added to the XML file.

Click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} after making changes.

![The settings configured for the ISO 20022 in the Accounting app settings page.](united_states/us-l10n-sepa-settings.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Name Identification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Issuer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} information are typically
provided by the bank.
::::

#### Company information {#l10n_us/contact-info-company}

Ensure the company\'s address information is correct, as the XML files
generated include the company address. Navigate to the
`Settings app --> Users & Companies --> Companies`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click on the desired company to open the
company form. Ensure the `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
fields are fully configured in the
`General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![The company record with address information completed.](united_states/us-l10n-company-address.png)

#### Recipient information {#l10n_us/contact-info-recipient}

The XML file generated contains the address and banking information for
*all* recipients. Open the **Contacts** app and ensure every contact
record that receives payments, both persons and companies, includes
complete `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} information in the
top-half of the contact form.

![The contact record for a company with address information completed.](united_states/us-l10n-company-contact.png)

Next, click into the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, and ensure at least one trusted bank account populates the
`Banks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. If no bank is listed,
add a `new bank account
<l10n_us/add-bank>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

##### Add a bank account {#l10n_us/add-bank}

To add a bank account on a contact record, open the **Contacts** app and
click on the contact record, and click into the
`Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Click into the
blank field next to `Banks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click
`Create...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a
`Create Banks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window loads.
Fill out the following fields on the form, then click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:

- `Account Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the bank
  account number.
- `ABA/Routing Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the ABA
  or routing number for the account.
- `Account Holder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  drop-down menu, select the owner of the bank account. The contact name
  (person or company) populates this field by default.
- `Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down menu,
  select the bank for the account. If the bank does not appear in the
  list, add a new bank by clicking `Search more...`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} then click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  and fill out the `Create Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  form.
- `Send Money`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Ensure this slider is
  set to `Trusted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The slider and
  text appears green if the bank account is trusted. If this is **not**
  set to trusted, an error appears when attempting to make a payment to
  the contact.

![Bank information on the Create Banks form.](united_states/us-l10n-add-bank.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Trusted bank accounts appear in green in the
`Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![A trusted bank account on a contact form.](united_states/us-l10n-trusted.png)
::::

#### Bank journal settings

Ensure the ISO payment methods appear in the bank journal, and are
configured correctly. Navigate to
`Accounting app --> Configurations --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click on the journal `Bank`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Click into the `Outgoing Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and ensure that in the
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, both
[ISO20022]{.title-ref} and [U.S. ISO20022]{.title-ref} appear.

Next, ensure all entries listed have the
`101404 Outstanding Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} account
selected in the `Outstanding Payments accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column. This allows Odoo to create journal entries for
payments.

### ISO20022 vs U.S. ISO20022

The U.S. ISO20022 is similar to the ISO standard, with some
U.S.-specific rules and formatting.

::: example
The U.S. ISO20022 uses ABA routing numbers, which are specific to the
U.S., while the generic ISO20022 uses IBAN numbers.
:::

  Feature        Global ISO 20022                                   U.S. ISO 20022
  -------------- -------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Developed by   ISO (global organization)                          U.S. payment system operators (Fed, TCH, NACHA)
  Used for       Global & cross-border payments                     Domestic U.S. payments
  Format         XML-based standard                                 XML (same base) with U.S. data rules
  Examples       SEPA Credit Transfer (Europe), SWIFT MX messages   Fedwire ISO 20022, CHIPS ISO 20022
  Differences    Global fields and formats                          Trimmed or modified to fit U.S. needs (e.g., ABA routing numbers instead of IBANs)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

It is recommended to use the generic ISO20022 for *international*
transfers, and use the U.S. ISO20022 for *domestic* transfers.
::::

### Workflow

First, `create <accounting/vendor_bills/creation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `confirm
<accounting/vendor_bills/bill-confirmation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} a vendor bill. Then, click the `Pay`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, and a `Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window loads. Using the drop-down menu, select
`ISO20022`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, then click
`Create Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Pay pop-up window configured for ISO20022.](united_states/us-l10n-pay.png)

A green `In Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner now
appears on the vendor bill. Next, navigate to
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and tick the checkbox next to the payment that
was paid using ISO20022 file to select it. Click
`Create Batch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the batch form. Once
validated, the batch payment moves to the `Sent`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} stage, and the U.S. ISO20022 XML file is created and
added to the chatter. The XML file can be downloaded and used to
initiate a bank payment.

![A batch payment with the XML file in the chatter.](united_states/us-l10n-batch.png)

Once the XML file is created, the following steps occur **outside** of
the Odoo database.

Log into the bank\'s online portal or payment system. Most banks that
support ISO 20022 have a special section for [file uploads]{.title-ref}
or [import payments]{.title-ref}. Upload the XML ISO 20022 file created
by Odoo (ending in [.xml]{.title-ref}) and upload it to the bank system.

The bank checks the XML file by reading the file and making sure all
details (accounts, amounts, etc.) are valid. The list of payments
appears inside the file. Review and confirm the information, then click
[Approve]{.title-ref} or [Submit]{.title-ref}.

The bank processes each payment in the file and transfers the funds to
the recipients.

# Uruguay

## Introduction {#uruguay/intro}

With the Uruguayan localization, you can generate electronic documents
with its XML, fiscal folio, electronic signature and connection to tax
authority Dirección General Impositiva (DGI) through Uruware.

The supported documents are:

- `e-Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `e-Invoice Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `e-Invoice Debit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
- `e-Ticket`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `e-Ticket Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},

Odoo automatically installs the base module **Uruguay - Accounting**
when a database is installed with [Uruguay]{.title-ref} selected as the
country. However, to enable electronic invoicing, the **Uruguay
Accounting EDI** ([l10n_uy_edi]{.title-ref}) module needs to be manually
`installed <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

### Company

To configure your company information, open the **Settings** app, scroll
down to the `Companies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
click `Update Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and configure
the following:

- `Company Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

- `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, including the
  `Street`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `City`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

- `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the identification
  number for the selected taxpayer type.

- `DGI Main Branch Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this is
  part of the XML when creating an electronic document. If this field is
  not set, all electronic documents will be rejected.

  To find the `DGI Main Branch Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  follow these steps:

  1.  From your [DGI
      account](https://servicios.dgi.gub.uy/serviciosenlinea), go to
      `Servicios en línea DGI --> Registro único tributario --> Consulta de datos`{.interpreted-text
      role="menuselection"}.
  2.  Select
      `Consulta de Datos Registrales --> Consulta de Datos de Entidades`{.interpreted-text
      role="menuselection"}.
  3.  Open the generated PDF to get the *DGI Main Branch Code* from the
      `Domicilio Fiscal
      Número de Local`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

After configuring the company in the database settings, navigate to
`Contacts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and search for your
company to verify the following:

- the company type is set to `Company`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- the `Identification Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
  `RUT / RUC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Set up a Uruware account {#l10n_uy/uruware-account}

To set up a Uruware account, follow these steps:

1.  Verify that you have a valid Odoo subscription.
2.  Locate the Uruware credentials settings by navigating to the
    `Accounting -->
    Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
3.  Scroll down to the `Uruguayan Localization`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} section and select the environment
    (`Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `Testing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).
4.  Click on `Create Uruware Account`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

Upon doing so, an email is sent to the address associated with your Odoo
subscription with the password to enter Uruware\'s portal and set up
your account.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- The email with the credentials is not immediate; it might take up to
48 hours for the account to be created. - The company\'s
`Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} needs to be set up to be
able to create an Uruware account. - The password sent expires after 24
hours. In this case, reset it by using the *Forgot Password* link in
Uruware\'s portal.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This action will create an account with Uruware with the following
information:

- Legal name (razón social)
- RUT from the company
- Username (the Odoo subscription email or [RUT]{.title-ref}.odoo. For
  example: [213344556677.odoo]{.title-ref})
- Odoo database link

To ensure your account is created correctly, please add any missing
information from above.
::::

Once the account is created and you have received the email containing
the credentials, configure your accounts directly in the Uruware
[testing portal](https://odootest.ucfe.com.uy/Gestion/) or [production
portal](https://prod6109.ucfe.com.uy/Gestion/):

Use the account credentials in the email to log in to the to the
corresponding ([test](https://odootest.ucfe.com.uy/Gestion/) or
[production](https://prod6109.ucfe.com.uy/Gestion/)) portal.

In Uruware\'s portal, the following steps are needed to be able to issue
invoices from Odoo:

1.  Complete and correct the company\'s information.
2.  Add your digital certificate.
3.  Add your
    `CAEs (Constancia de Autorización para Emisión)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} for each document-type you plan to issue.
4.  Configure the format of the PDF to be printed and sent to your
    customers.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Be sure to configure two accounts, one for testing and one for
production. The certificate is needed in both environments, but
`CAEs (Constancia de Autorización para Emisión)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} are only needed in production.

### Electronic invoice data

To configure the electronic invoice data, an environment and credentials
need to be configured. To do so, navigate to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and scroll down to the
`Uruguayan Localization`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

First, select the `UCFE Web Services`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
environment:

- `Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: for production
  databases. In this mode, electronic documents are sent to
  `DGI (Dirección General Impositiva)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  through Uruware for their validation.
- `Testing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: for test databases. In
  this mode, the direct connection flows can be tested, with the files
  sent to the `DGI (Dirección General Impositiva)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} testing environment through Uruware.
- `Demo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: files are created and
  accepted automatically in demo mode but are **not** sent to the
  `DGI (Dirección General Impositiva)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
  For this reason, rejection errors will not appear in this mode. Every
  internal validation can be tested in demo mode. Avoid selecting this
  option in a production database.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Using `Demo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} mode does not require a
Uruware account.
::::

Then, enter the `Uruware Data`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:

- `Uruware WS Password`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Commerce Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Terminal Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

![Required information for electronic invoice.](uruguay/electronic-invoice-data.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This data can be obtained from the Uruware portal after configuring the
`Uruware account
<l10n_uy/uruware-account>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

To get the `Uruware WS Password`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, go
to `Configuration --> Company -->
Edit`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and look for the
`Validators and Additional Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab to find `WS Password`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

To get the `Commerce Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, go to
`Configuration --> Branches`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

To get the `Terminal Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, go to
`Configuration --> Issuing Points`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

### Master data

#### Chart of accounts

The
`chart of accounts <../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is installed by default as part of the set of data included
in the localization module, the accounts are mapped automatically in
taxes, default accounts payable, and default accounts receivable.

Accounts can be added or deleted according to the company\'s needs.

::: seealso
`../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

#### Contacts

To create a contact, navigate to `Contacts app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then enter the following information:

- `Company Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  - `Street`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: required to confirm an
    electronic invoice.
  - `City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: required to confirm an
    electronic invoice.
- `Identification Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  - `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select a identification
    type.
  - `Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: required to confirm an
    electronic invoice.

#### Taxes

As part of the Uruguay localization module, taxes are automatically
created with its configuration and related financial accounts.

![Taxes for Uruguay.](uruguay/taxes.png)

#### Document types

Some accounting transactions, like *customer invoices* and *vendor
bills* are classified by document types. These are defined by the
government fiscal authorities, in this case by the
`DGI (Dirección General Impositiva)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Each document type can have a unique sequence per journal where it is
assigned. The data is created automatically when the localization module
is installed, and the information required for the document types is
included by default.

To review the document types included in the localization, navigate to
`Accounting
--> Configuration --> Document Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In Uruguay,
`CAEs (Constancia de Autorización de Emisión)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} **must** be uploaded in Uruware. Sequences (and PDFs) are
received in Odoo from Uruware, based on their
`CAEs (Constancia de Autorización de Emisión)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.
`CAEs (Constancia de Autorización de Emisión)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} are **only** used in production. When testing, only a range
of sequences used in Uruware need to be set.
::::

![Document types for Uruguay.](uruguay/document-types.png)

#### Sales journals

To generate and confirm an electronic document that will be validated by
`DGI (Dirección General Impositiva)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
sales journal needs to be configured with the following:

- `Invoicing Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: by default
  `Electronic`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is set. This is
  necessary to send electronic documents via web service to the
  Uruguayan government through Uruware. The other option,
  `Manual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, is for open invoices
  previously stamped in another system, for example, in the
  `DGI (Dirección General Impositiva)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
- `Use Documents?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Activate this
  option if this journal will use documents from the list of document
  types in Odoo.

## Workflows

Once you have configured your database, you can create your documents.

### Sales documents

#### Customer invoices

`Customer invoices <../accounting/customer_invoices>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} are electronic documents that, when validated, are sent to
`DGI (Dirección General Impositiva)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} via
Uruware. These documents can be created from your sales order or
manually. They must contain the following data:

- `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: type the customer\'s
  information.
- `Due date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to compute if the
  invoice is due now or later (*contado* or *crédito*, respectively).
- `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the electronic
  sales journal.
- `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: document type in
  this format, for example, [(111) e-Invoice]{.title-ref}.
- `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: specify the product(s)
  with the correct taxes.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Every document type has a specific credit note and debit note (e.g., the
document type `(111) e-Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} has
an `(112) e-Invoice Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).
::::

#### Customer credit note

The
`Customer credit note <../accounting/customer_invoices/credit_notes>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is an electronic document that, when validated, is sent to
`DGI (Dirección General Impositiva)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} via
Uruware. It is necessary to have a validated (posted) invoice to
register a credit note. On the invoice, click the
`Credit note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to access the
`Create credit note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form, then
complete the following information:

- `Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: type the reason for the
  credit note.
- `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the journal that
  has to be electronic and has the `Use
  Documents?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option active.
- `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the credit
  note document type.
- `Reversal Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: type the date.

#### Customer debit note

The
`Customer debit note <../accounting/customer_invoices/credit_notes>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is an electronic document that, when validated, is sent to
`DGI (Dirección General Impositiva)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} via
Uruware. It is necessary to have a validated (posted) invoice to
register a debit note. On the invoice, click the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} (`action menu`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}) icon, select the `Debit note`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option to access the
`Create credit note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form, then
complete the following information:

- `Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Type the reason for the
  debit note.
- `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the journal that
  has to be electronic and has the `Use
  Documents?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option active.
- `Copy lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick the checkbox to
  copy the invoice lines to the debit note.
- `Debit note date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Type the date.

Confirm the invoice to create it with an internal reference. To send the
document to `DGI (Dirección General Impositiva)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} via Uruware, click on `Send and Print`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and select the checkbox `Create CFE`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The legal document sequence (number) is brought from
Uruware once the document has been processed. Make sure you have

## Addendas and disclosures

*Addendas* and *disclosures* are additional notes and comments added to
an electronic document that can be mandatory or optional. To create a
new addenda, go to `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Addendas and disclosures`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Enter the following information:

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: name of the addenda or
  mandatory disclosure.

  this will add it to the specific section in the XML.
- `Is legend`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this box if the
  text is a mandatory disclosure, leave it blank if it is additional
  information.
- `Content`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Add the complete text of
  the addenda or disclosure.

### Leyenda and additional information in product

To add a *leyenda* or additional information to the product and XML, it
is necessary to add the preconfigured addenda and disclosure to the
product in the invoice line. Add the *leyenda* in the
`Disclosure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field of the product
specified in the line.

### Leyenda and additional information

To add a *leyenda* or additional information to the electronic invoice
and XML, access the invoice, go to the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and select the desired addenda in the `Addenda and
Disclosure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. The addenda and
disclosures added here will appear in the XML and visibly in the PDF
document.

This applies to the following types of *addendas*:

- Document
- Issuer
- Receiver
- Addendas

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To add a temporary note to the electronic document, use the
`Terms and Conditions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. This
information will be sent in the addenda of the invoice, but it won\'t be
saved for future documents.

# Fiscal localizations

Fiscal localizations are country-specific modules that allow you to be
compliant with a country\'s fiscal requirements. Most of these modules
are related to the Accounting app, but they can also be necessary for
other apps such as Point of Sale, eCommerce, etc., depending on a
country\'s fiscal requirements.

::: seealso
`../hr/payroll/payroll_localizations`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} are
documented separately.
:::

## Configuration {#fiscal_localizations/packages}

Odoo should automatically install the fiscal localization\'s core
modules based on the company\'s country when the related app is
installed. The rest can be manually `installed
<general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Refer to the
`list of countries <fiscal_localizations/countries-list>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to view the currently supported countries and access their
specific documentation.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Each company in a multi-company environment can use different fiscal
localization modules.
::::

Verify the right package of modules is installed by going to
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
checking the `Package`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field under
the `Fiscal
Localization`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Select another
one if necessary.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Selecting another package is only possible if no entry has been posted.
::::

These packages require fine-tuning the chart of accounts, activating the
taxes to be used, configuring the country-specific statements and
certifications, and sometimes more.

## List of countries {#fiscal_localizations/countries-list}

Fiscal localization modules are available for the countries listed
below.

:::: note

# Authorize.Net

[Authorize.Net](https://www.authorize.net) is a United States-based
online payment solution provider, allowing businesses to accept **credit
cards**.

## Configuration

::: seealso
\- `payment_providers/add_new`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
:::

### Credentials tab

Odoo needs your **API Credentials & Keys** to connect with your
Authorize.Net account, which comprise:

- **API Login ID**: The ID solely used to identify the account with
  Authorize.Net.
- **API Transaction Key**
- **API Signature Key**
- **API Client Key**

To retrieve them, log into your Authorize.Net account, go to
`Account --> Settings
--> Security Settings --> API Credentials & Keys`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, generate your **Transaction Key** and **Signature
Key**, and paste them on the related fields in Odoo. Then, click on
**Generate Client Key**.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To test Authorize.Net with a *sandbox* account, change the
`State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to `Test
Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. We recommend doing this on a
test Odoo database, rather than on your main database.

If you use the `Test Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with a
regular account, it results in the following error: *The merchant login
ID or password is invalid or the account is inactive*.
::::

### Configuration tab

#### Place a hold on a card

With Authorize.Net, you can enable the `manual capture
<payment_providers/manual_capture>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. If
enabled, the funds are reserved for 30 days on the customer\'s card, but
not charged yet.

:::: warning

After **30 days**, the transaction is **voided automatically** by

## ACH payments (USA only) {#authorize/ach_payments}

`ACH (automated clearing house)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is an
electronic funds transfer system used between bank accounts in the
United States.

### Configuration

To give customers the possibility to pay using ACH, [sign up for
Authorize.Net eCheck\'s
service](https://www.authorize.net/payments/echeck.html). Once eCheck is
activated, duplicate the previously configured Authorize.Net payment
provider on Odoo by going to `Accounting
--> Configuration --> Payment Providers --> Authorize.net`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, click the cog icon (`⛭`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}) and select `Duplicate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Change the provider\'s name to differentiate both
versions (e.g., [Authorize.net - Banks]{.title-ref}).

When ready, change the provider\'s `State`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to `Enabled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for a
regular account or `Test Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for a
sandbox account.

:::

- Log in to Authorize.Net.
- Go to
  `Account --> Statements --> eCheck.Net Settlement Statement`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}.
- Define an export range using an *opening* and *closing* batch
  settlement. All transactions within the two batch settlements will be
  exported to Odoo.
- Select all transactions within the desired range, copy them, and paste
  them into the `Report 1 Download`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  sheet of the `Excel import template
  <authorize-import-template>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

In this case, the first batch (01/01/2021) of the year belongs to the
settlement of 12/31/2020, so the **opening** settlement is from
12/31/2020.
:::

Once the data is in the `Report 1 Download`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} sheet:

- Go to the `Transaction Search`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
  on Authorize.Net.
- Under the `Settlement Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  section, select the previously used range of batch settlement dates in
  the `From:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `To:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields and click
  `Search`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- When the list has been generated, click
  `Download to File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- In the pop-up window, select
  `Expanded Fields with CAVV Response/Comma Separated`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, enable `Include Column Headings`{.interpreted-text

  role="guilabel"}.
- Open the text file, select `All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  copy the data, and paste it into the `Report
  2 Download`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sheet of the
  `Excel import template <authorize-import-template>`{.interpreted-text

- Transit lines are automatically filled in and updated in the
  `transit for report 1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `transit for report 2`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sheets of
  the `Excel import template
  <authorize-import-template>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Make sure
  all entries are present, and **if not**, copy the formula from
  previously filled-in lines of the
  `transit for report 1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `2`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sheets and paste it into the
  empty lines.

### Import into Odoo

To import the data into Odoo:

- Open the
  `Excel import template <authorize-import-template>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- Copy the data from the `transit for report 2`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} sheet and use *paste special* to only paste the
  values in the `Odoo Import to CSV`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  sheet.
- Look for *blue* cells in the `Odoo Import to CSV`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} sheet. These are chargeback entries without any
  reference number. As they cannot be imported as such, go to
  `Authorize.Net --> Account --> Statements --> eCheck.Net Settlement Statement`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}.
- Look for `Charge Transaction/Chargeback`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, and click it.
- Copy the invoice description, paste it into the
  `Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} cell of the `Odoo
  Import to CSV`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sheet, and add
  [Chargeback /]{.title-ref} before the description.
- If there are multiple invoices, add a line into the
  `Excel import template
  <authorize-import-template>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for each
  invoice and copy/paste the description into each respective
  `Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line.

:::: note
::: title

For **combined chargeback/returns** in the payouts, create a new line in
the `Excel import
template <authorize-import-template>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for
each invoice.
::::

::: example
![Chargeback description](authorize/authorize-chargeback-desc.png)

- Next, delete *zero transaction* and *void transaction* line items, and
  change the format of the `Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  column in the `Odoo Import to CSV`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  sheet to *Number*.
- Go back to
  `eCheck.Net Settlement Statement --> Search for a Transaction`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"} and search again for the previously used batch
  settlements dates.
- Verify that the batch settlement dates on eCheck.Net match the related
  payments\' dates found in the `Date`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} column of the `Odoo Import to CSV`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- If it does not match, replace the date with the one from eCheck.Net.
  Sort the column by *date*, and make sure the format is
  [MM/DD/YYYY]{.title-ref}.
- Copy the data - column headings included - from the
  `Odoo Import to CSV`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sheet, paste
  it into a new Excel file, and save it using the CSV format.
- Open the Accounting app, go to
  `Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
  tick the `Authorize.Net`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box, and
  click `Favorites --> Import records --> Load
  file`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Select the CSV file and

## Wire transfer {#payment_providers/bank_payments/wire_transfer}

The **Wire Transfer** payment method allows you to provide payment
instructions to customers, such as your bank details and a reference to
include with the payment. These instructions are displayed after the
customer selects `Wire Transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
the payment method and clicks the `Pay now`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button at the end of the checkout process on your
ecommerce website or on the customer portal.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- While this method is widely accessible and requires minimal setup, it
is not efficient process-wise. It is recommended to set up a
`payment provider <../payment_providers>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
instead. - Online orders remain in the
`Quotation sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (i.e., unpaid order)
stage until you receive the payment and manually
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the order.
::::

To configure **Wire Transfer**, follow these steps:

1.  `Navigate to the Wire Transfer payment provider <payment_providers/supported_providers>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

2.  In the `Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
    select whether the memo or `Communication`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} to be displayed alongside the payment instructions
    should be:

    - `Based on Document Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
      the sales order or invoice number
    - `Based on Customer ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
      customer identifier

3.  Enable `Enable QR codes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
    activate QR code payments.

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    `Additional accounting setup <../accounting/customer_invoices/epc_qr_code>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} is required to use QR codes.
    ::::

4.  Define the payment instructions in the `Messages`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} tab. If `a bank account
    <../accounting/bank>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} has already been
    defined, the account number is automatically added to the default
    message generated by Odoo. You can also add it afterward and update
    the message by clicking `Reload pending message`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

5.  Set the `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
    `Enabled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The **Wire transfer** payment method can serve as a template for other

## SEPA Direct Debit {#payment_providers/bank_payments/sdd}

SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) is a payment-integration initiative of
the European Union that facilitates standardized and simplified
electronic payments in euros across participating countries.

SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) is a payment provider that allows future
payments to be collected from customers\' bank accounts based on a
signed `SEPA Direct Debit mandate
<accounting/batch_sdd/sdd_mandates>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. This
is particularly useful for recurring payments based on a
`subscription </applications/sales/subscriptions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To use the SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) payment provider and create
`SEPA Direct Debit mandates
<accounting/batch_sdd/sdd_mandates>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:

- The invoice being paid must be for an amount in euros.
- The `SEPA Direct Deposit (SDD)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  feature must be enabled, and the company\'s
  `Creditor Identifier`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be
  defined in the `Accounting or Invoicing settings
  <accounting/batch_sdd/sepa-configuration>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
::::

### Configuration {#sdd/configuration}

To configure **SEPA Direct Debit**, follow these steps:

1.  `Navigate to the SEPA Direct Debit payment provider <payment_providers/supported_providers>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

2.  In the `Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
    select whether the memo or `Communication`{.interpreted-text

    **bank account number**. These instructions are displayed at the end
    of the checkout process on your ecommerce website or on the customer
    portal.

\- Leave the `Currencies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field set
to the default `EUR`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tag to ensure
`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is only
available for payments in euros. - The `Bank Account`{.interpreted-text

::::

### Online payments with `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} {#online-payments-with-sdd}

Customers selecting `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} as a payment method are prompted to enter their IBAN to
complete the
`SEPA Direct Debit mandate <accounting/batch_sdd/sdd_mandates>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

The `SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} mandate is
then automatically created in `Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
based on the provided IBAN. To validate the information, customers must
confirm each new mandate with a successful bank transfer of the expected
amount **using the specified payment reference (communication)** defined
in the
`SEPA Direct Debit payment provider's form <sdd/configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Once this initial payment is received and
`reconciled <../accounting/bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, the mandate is automatically validated and updated to the
`Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status. Once a mandate is
active, it is reused for all subsequent payments made with the
`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} payment method.
You can then collect them by
`uploading them to your online banking interface <accounting/batch_sdd/XML>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

::: seealso
`../accounting/payments/batch_sdd`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}

`closed <accounting/batch_sdd/close-revoke-mandate>`{.interpreted-text

`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is also
available as a payment method through other providers, such as
`adyen`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, `buckaroo`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, and `stripe`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. In these cases,
`SDD (SEPA Direct Debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} mandates are
handled externally by the payment provider.

Odoo embeds several **payment providers** that allow your customers to
pay online, on their *customer portals*, or on your *eCommerce website*.
They can pay sales orders, invoices, or subscriptions with recurring
payments using their favorite payment methods, such as **credit cards**.

Each payment provider is linked to a list of supported `payment methods
<payment_providers/payment_methods>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} that
can be (de)activated based on your needs.

Note
:::

Odoo apps delegate the handling of sensitive information to the
certified payment provider so that you don\'t ever have to worry about
PCI compliance. No sensitive information (such as credit card numbers)
is stored on Odoo servers or Odoo databases hosted elsewhere. Instead,
Odoo apps use a unique reference number for the data stored safely in
the payment providers\' systems.
::::

## Supported payment providers {#payment_providers/supported_providers}

To access the supported payment providers, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Payment Providers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
`Website --> Configuration --> Payment Providers`{.interpreted-text

\- Each provider has its own specific configuration flow, depending on
which feature is available. - Some of these online payment providers can
also be added as `bank accounts
<../finance/accounting/bank>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, but this is
**not** the same process as adding them as payment providers. Payment
providers allow customers to pay online, and bank accounts are added and
configured in the Accounting app to do a `bank reconciliation
<accounting/bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

In addition to the regular payment providers that integrate with an API,
such as Stripe, PayPal, or Adyen, Odoo bundles the
`Demo payment provider <payment_providers/demo>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. This payment provider allows you to test business flows
involving online payments. No credentials are required as the demo
payments are dummy payments.
::::

### Bank payments {#payment_providers/bank_payments}

- | `Wire Transfer <payment_providers/bank_payments/wire_transfer>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
  | Odoo displays your payment information with a payment reference. You
    have to approve the payment manually once it has been received in
    your bank account.

- | `SEPA Direct Debit <payment_providers/bank_payments/sdd>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
  | Customers can make a bank transfer to register a SEPA Direct Debit
    mandate and allow their account to be charged directly for future
    payments.

### In-person payments

- | `Pay on Site <payment_providers/inperson_payments/pay_on_site>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
  | Customers can reserve products online and pay when collecting their
    orders in store.

- | `Cash on Delivery <payment_providers/inperson_payments/cash_on_delivery>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
  | Customers can pay for their orders upon delivery.

## Enabling a payment provider {#payment_providers/add_new}

To add a new payment provider and make its related payment methods
available to your customers, proceed as follows:

1.  Go to the payment provider\'s website, create an account, and make
    sure you have the API credentials requested for third-party use.
    These are necessary for Odoo to communicate with the payment
    provider.
2.  In Odoo, navigate to the `Payment providers`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} by going to `Accounting -->
    Configuration --> Payment Providers`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}, `Website --> Configuration --> Payment
    Providers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, or
    `Sales --> Configuration --> Payment Providers`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
3.  Select the provider and configure the
    `Credentials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
4.  Set the `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
    `Enabled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- The fields available in the `Credentials`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab depend on the payment provider. Refer to the
`related documentation <payment_providers/supported_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for more information. - Once you have enabled the payment
provider, it is automatically published on your website. If you wish to
unpublish it, click the `Published`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button. Customers cannot make payments through an unpublished provider,
but they can still manage
`(delete and assign to a subscription)`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}
their existing tokens linked to such a provider.
::::

### Test mode {#payment_providers/test-mode}

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

We recommend using the test mode on a **duplicate** or a **test**
database to avoid potential issues with invoice numbering.
::::

To try a payment provider without affecting live transactions, set the
`State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field in the payment provider
form to `Test mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, enter the
**provider\'s dedicated test or sandbox credentials** in the
`Credentials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Each payment
provider has its own separate test account or environment for this
purpose.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

By default, the payment provider remains **unpublished** in test mode so
that it\'s not visible to visitors.
::::

## Payment methods {#payment_providers/payment_methods}

Each payment provider is related to a list of supported payment methods;
the methods listed in the `Payment methods`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field in the `Configuration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of the payment provider form are the ones that have
been activated. To activate or deactivate a payment method for a
provider, click `Enable Payment Methods`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, then click the toggle button of the related method.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- To view the complete list of supported payment methods, go to
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Payment Methods`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, `Website --> Configuration -->
Payment Methods`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, or
`Sales --> Configuration --> Payment Methods`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. - Payment methods are displayed on the ecommerce
website based on their sequence order. To reorder them, drag and drop
the payment methods into the desired order in the
`Payment Methods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list.
::::

### Icons and brands

The icons displayed next to the payment method on your website are
either the icons of the brands activated for the payment method or, if
there aren\'t any, the icons of the payment methods themselves. To
modify them, `access the list of payment methods
<payment_providers/payment_methods>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, then
click the relevant one.

To modify a payment method\'s icon, hover your mouse over the image in
the upper-right corner of the payment method\'s form and click the
`fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} (`pencil`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}) icon.

Select the `Brands`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to view the
brands that have been activated for the payment method. The brands and
their related icons are displayed based on their sequence order; to
reorder them, drag and drop them into the desired order. To modify a
brand\'s icon, select the brand, then, in the popup window that opens,
hover the mouse over the image in the upper-right corner and click the
`fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} (`pencil`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}) icon.

### Advanced configuration

To further configure payment methods, follow these steps:

1.  Activate the `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
2.  `Access the list of payment methods <payment_providers/payment_methods>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and click the relevant one.
3.  Go to the `Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and
    adjust the features as needed.

:::: danger
::: title
Danger
:::

\- Each payment method is preconfigured in a way that aligns with the
payment providers\' behavior and their integration with Odoo. Any change
to this configuration may result in errors and should be tested on a
duplicate or test database first. - Modifications to the payment
method\'s configuration only work to the extent of the method\'s and
provider\'s capabilities. For example, adding `countries
<payment_providers/currencies_countries>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
for a payment method only supported in one country or enabling
`tokenization <payment_providers/tokenization>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for a method linked to a provider that does not support it
will not produce the intended results.
::::

## Tokenization {#payment_providers/tokenization}

`If the payment provider supports this feature <payment_providers/online_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, customers can save their payment method details for later.
To enable this feature, go to the `Configuration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of the selected payment provider and enable
`Allow Saving
Payment Methods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In this case, a **payment token** is created in Odoo to be used as a
payment method for subsequent payments without the customer having to
enter their payment method details again. This is particularly useful
for the eCommerce conversion rate and subscriptions that use recurring
payments.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To add or delete their saved payment method details, customers can click
`Manage
payment methods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`customer portal <users-portal-payment-methods>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

::: admonition
PCI DSS and Attestation of Compliance

Odoo is not [PCI](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org) DSS-certified
because it does not store cardholder data or process payments. Instead,
it outsources tokenization and payment to
`external payment providers <payment_providers/online_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, which means that as an Odoo customer, you only need to
complete the minimal Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) with the
provider to obtain the Attestation of Compliance (AoC) and achieve PCI
compliance. Odoo should not be mentioned as a payment processor or a
third-party service provider in the
`SAQ (Self-Assessment Questionnaire)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
:::

## Manual capture {#payment_providers/manual_capture}

`If the payment provider supports this feature <payment_providers/online_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, you can authorize and capture payments in two steps instead
of one. To enable this feature, go to the
`Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the selected
payment provider and enable `Capture Amount
Manually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

When you authorize a payment, the funds are reserved on the customer\'s
payment method but not immediately charged. They are charged when you
manually capture the payment later on. You can also void the
authorization to cancel it and release the reserved funds. Capturing
payments manually is helpful in many situations:

- Receive the payment confirmation and wait until the order is shipped
  to capture the payment.
- Review and verify that orders are legitimate before the payment is
  completed and the fulfillment process starts.
- Avoid potentially high refund fees for refunded payments: payment
  providers will not charge you for voiding an authorization.
- Hold a security deposit to return later, minus any deductions (e.g.,
  in case of damages).

To capture the payment after it was authorized, go to the related sales
order or invoice and click the `Capture Transaction`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. To release the funds, click the `Void
Transaction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Some payment providers support capturing only part of the authorized
amount. The remaining amount can then be either captured or voided.
These providers have the value **Full and partial** in the
`table above <payment_providers/online_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. The providers that only support capturing or voiding the
total amount have the value **Full only**. - The funds are likely not
reserved forever. After a certain time, they may be automatically
released back to the customer\'s payment method. Refer to your payment
provider\'s documentation for the exact reservation duration. -
`payment_providers/adyen`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
`payment_providers/stripe`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} allow to
capture payments manually directly from their website interface.
::::

## Refunds {#payment_providers/refunds}

If your payment provider supports this feature, you can refund payments
directly from Odoo. It does not need to be enabled first. To refund a
customer payment, navigate to it and click the
`Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Some payment providers support refunding only part of the amount. The
remaining amount can then optionally be refunded, too. These providers
have the value **Full and partial** in the
`table above <payment_providers/online_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. The providers that only support refunding the total amount
have the value **Full only**. -
`payment_providers/adyen`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
`payment_providers/stripe`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} allow to refund
payments directly from their website interface.
::::

## Express checkout {#payment_providers/express_checkout}

`If the payment provider supports this feature <payment_providers/online_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, you can allow customers to use the
`Google Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Apple Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons and pay their
eCommerce orders in one click. When they use one of these buttons,
customers go straight from the cart to the confirmation page without
filling out the contact form. They just have to validate the payment on
Google\'s or Apple\'s payment form.

To enable this feature, go to the `Configuration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of the selected payment provider and enable
`Allow Express Checkout`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

All prices shown on the express checkout payment form always include
taxes.
::::

## Availability {#payment_providers/availability}

You can adapt the payment provider\'s availability by specifying the
`Maximum amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} allowed and
modifying the `Currencies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Countries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To display an availability report for payment providers and payment
methods, and to help diagnose potential availability issues on the
payment form, enable the `developer-mode`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
then click the `fa-bug`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
(`bug`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) icon next to the
`Choose a payment method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading on
the payment form. The report includes a list of enabled payment
providers and payment methods, reasons for any payment providers or
methods not being available, if applicable, and a list of supported
providers for each payment method.
::::

### Currencies and countries {#payment_providers/currencies_countries}

All payment providers have a different list of available currencies and
countries. They serve as a first filter during payment operations, i.e.,
the payment methods linked to the payment provider are not available for
selection if the customer\'s currency or country is not in the supported
list. As there might be errors, updates, and unknowns in the lists of
available currencies and countries, adding or removing a payment
provider\'s supported currencies or countries is possible.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

- `Payment methods <payment_providers/payment_methods>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} also have their own list of available currencies and
  countries that serves as another filter during payment operations.
- If the list of supported currencies or countries is empty, it means
  the list is too long to be displayed, or Odoo does not have
  information on that payment provider. The payment provider remains
  available, even though it is possible the payment will be refused at a
  later stage should the country or currency not be supported.
::::

### Maximum amount {#payment_providers/maximum_amount}

You can restrict the `Maximum Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
that can be paid with the selected provider. Leave the field to
[0.00]{.title-ref} to make the payment provider available regardless of
the payment amount.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

This feature is not intended to work on pages that allow the customer to
update the payment amount, e.g., the **Donation** snippet and the
**Checkout** page when paid `shipping methods
<../websites/ecommerce/shipping>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} are
enabled.
::::

## Payment journal {#payment_providers/journal}

A `payment journal <accounting/bank>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} must
be defined for the payment provider to record the payments on an
**outstanding account**. By default, the `Bank`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} journal is added as the payment journal for all payment
providers. To modify it, go to the `Configuration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of the selected payment provider and select another
`Payment journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- The payment journal must be a `Bank`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} journal. - The same journal can be used for several
payment providers. - Payment journals must only be configured if the
`Invoicing or Accounting app <accounting>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
is installed.
::::

### Accounting perspective

From an accounting perspective, there are two types of online payment
workflows: the payments that are directly deposited into your bank
account and follow the usual `reconciliation
<accounting/bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
workflow, and those coming from third-party `online payment
providers <payment_providers/online_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and require you to follow another accounting workflow. For
these payments, you need to consider how you want to record your
payments\' journal entries. We recommend you ask your accountant for
advice.

By default, the `Bank Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
defined for the `payment journal
<payment_providers/journal>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is used, but
you can also specify an `outstanding account
<accounting/journals/outstanding-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for each payment provider to separate the provider\'s
payments from other payments.

# 360 Feedback

Odoo\'s **Appraisals** app lets managers gather feedback on their direct
reports from anyone in the company. Input from colleagues gives managers
a fuller view of each employee\'s strengths, growth areas, and
collaboration skills.

## 360 feedback dashboard {#appraisals/360-dashboard}

The `360 Feedback`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section displays
information for all the surveys configured for the **Appraisals** app.
To view the surveys and their statistics, navigate to `Appraisals
app --> Configuration --> 360 Feedback`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![A list view of all available surveys in the Appraisals application.](360/survey-list.png)

Each appraisal, or survey, is presented on its own line on the
`360 Feedback`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, along with
various information related to that particular appraisal.

Each appraisal includes the following information:

- `Survey Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the name of the
  specific survey.
- `Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the employee
  responsible for the survey, including the month and year they were
  given that designation.
- `Questions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the number of
  questions in that particular survey.
- `Average Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the average
  time a user spends completing the survey.
- `Registered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the number of people
  who have been sent the survey.
- `Completed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the number of people
  who have completed the survey.
- `Certified`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the survey is for a
  certification, the percentage of users who have passed the
  certification.

Each appraisal row offers two actions:

- `Test`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Opens the appraisal in a
  new tab to preview the questions without submitting answers. Close the
  tab to return to the list, or click `oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} `Go to
  Survey`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}/`Go to Appraisal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  for the full form.
- `See Results`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `View response analytics <appraisals/360-view-results>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

## Request feedback {#appraisals/360-request-feedback}

To request feedback from a colleague, navigate to the **Appraisals**
app, and click on the appraisal card to open it.

Click the `Ask Feedback`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and
an `Ask Feedback`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} email pop-up window
appears, using the `Appraisal: Ask Feedback`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} email template.

First, using the drop-down menu, select the employees being asked to
provide feedback in the `Recipients`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. Multiple employees may be selected. Next, make any desired
changes to the default message, and attach any relevant documents.

The `Answer Deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} date is
automatically set to the day after the `Appraisal
Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the appraisal form. Using
the calendar selector, modify the date, if desired.

Click `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the feedback
requests are sent to the specified employees.

![The email pop-up when requesting feedback from other employees.](360/ask-feedback.png)

## View results {#appraisals/360-view-results}

To view the results from everyone who has completed a survey, click the
`See Results`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the end of
the corresponding survey line in the `360 Feedback dashboard
<appraisals/360-dashboard>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. This presents
all the answers for the survey in a new tab. Each question provides
information on how many people responded to a question, and how many
people skipped it. All answers for each question are visible.

To save a PDF version of the survey results, click the
`fa-print`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Print)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon at the top of the page. To exit, close the tab.

In addition to viewing the responses from past appraisals and surveys,
new surveys can also be created from the
`360 Feedback`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page. Click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the top-left of the
page to create a new survey.

For more information on how to create a survey, refer to the
`../../marketing/surveys/create`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} document.

# Appraisal analysis

The **Appraisals** app has the ability to report on all the appraisals
in the system, including past, present, and future appraisals, and their
respective statuses. This report helps managers track scheduled
appraisals, and identify any overdue or unconfirmed ones.

To access the *Appraisal Analysis* report, navigate to
`Appraisals app --> Reporting
--> Appraisal Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

On the `Appraisal Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, a
report loads, displaying all the appraisals in the database, in a
default graph chart. Appraisals are grouped by `Month`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, then `Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## View by status

Another way to view the *Appraisal Analysis* report is in the Gantt
view, which provides visual information on the appraisal\'s status.

Navigate to
`Appraisals app --> Reporting --> Appraisal Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click the `fa-tasks`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Gantt)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
upper-right corner. The report displays the current year, grouped by
department, with the current month highlighted.

Each entry is highlighted in a different color to represent their
status:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Color     Status                               Meaning
  --------- ------------------------------------ --------------------------------------
  Yellow    `Done`{.interpreted-text             The appraisal was completed.
            role="guilabel"}                     

  Orange    `Appraisal Sent`{.interpreted-text   The appraisal was confirmed, but not
            role="guilabel"}                     completed.

  Red       `Cancelled`{.interpreted-text        The appraisal was cancelled.
            role="guilabel"}                     

  Gray      `To Start`{.interpreted-text         The appraisal was scheduled, but not
            role="guilabel"}                     confirmed.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Appraisals are scheduled automatically (appear in gray), according to
their respective `appraisals/appraisal-plan`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

To change the period of time that is presented, adjust the date settings
in the top-left corner of the report by clicking the
`fa-calendar`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`From: (date) to (date)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to reveal a
drop-down menu of options. The options to display are
`Today`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`This week`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`This month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`This quarter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`This year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Additionally, a range of dates can be entered in the
`From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `To`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} fields at the bottom of the list, then click
`Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

At any point, click the `fa-crosshairs`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Focus Today)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to have the
report include today\'s date in the view.

To view the details of any appraisal, click on any appraisal. A pop-over
window appears, displaying the due date for the appraisal. To view more
details, click the `View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and
further details appear in an `Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window.

The report can have other `filters <search/filters>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `groupings <search/group>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
set in the search bar at the top.

![A report showing all the appraisals for the Appraisal Analysis report.](appraisal_analysis/analysis.png)

## Group by status {#appraisals/group-status}

When a company has a large number of employees, the default
`Appraisal Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report may
display too much information to view at one time. In this scenario,
viewing the data by status can be beneficial.

First, clear any filters or groups from the search bar. Next, click the
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Toggle Search Panel)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
far-right of the search bar. Click `Status`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `oi-group`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. Click away from
the drop-down menu to close it.

All the appraisals are now organized by status, in the following order:
`Cancelled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `To Start`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Appraisal Sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

This view shows which appraisals need to be completed, and when, as well
as which appraisals still need to be confirmed.

![A report showing all the appraisals, grouped by status.](appraisal_analysis/by-status.png)

## Use case: view only the user\'s appraisals

When viewing the `Appraisal Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
report, it can save time to only view the appraisals the signed-in user
is responsible for, and hide the rest.

To only view this data, click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Toggle Search Panel)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon in the far-right of the search bar, revealing a drop-down menu.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It is not necessary to remove the default `oi-group`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} grouping.
If it remains active, the results are grouped by department. If it is
removed, the results appear in a list, alphabetically.
::::

Click `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the
bottom of the `fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, and a
`Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears.

Click into the first field, and a pop-over appears with a variety of
options. Click the `fa-chevron-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(right arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon after the word
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then scroll down and
click on `Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Next, set the
middle field to `=`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`(equal)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Last, click the third
field and select the desired user from the list. When all the fields are
set, click `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![A customized filter to show only the user\'s employees.](appraisal_analysis/custom.png)

Now, the only appraisals that appear are the appraisals that the
selected user is responsible for, instead of viewing *all* the
appraisals.

This report can also be
`grouped by status <appraisals/group-status>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

# Appraisal templates

The **Appraisals** app uses a preconfigured default template, which is
general enough to be applicable to all employees. If desired, the
default template `can be modified
<appraisals/modify-template>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, or, if
different templates are needed, such as department-specific appraisal
templates, new templates
`can be created <appraisals/create-template>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

## Modify appraisal templates {#appraisals/modify-template}

If needed, changes can be made to the default template. To view the
default template, navigate to
`Appraisals app --> Configuration --> Appraisal Templates`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

The default template appears in a list view, named
`Default Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click on the
template to view the template details. Make any desired changes to the
template.

The default template consists of the following questions:

: Odoo **Appraisals** default appraisal template

## Create appraisal templates {#appraisals/create-template}

Large companies with many departments may prefer department-specific
appraisal templates, instead of using a default universal template.
Creating and using department-specific templates can be helpful if
specific feedback is needed.

::: example
An appliance repair company has two main types of employees, office
workers who handle administrative tasks and scheduling, and repair
technicians who work in the field, performing repairs at customers\'
homes.

This type of company may create two different appraisal templates, one
for the office workers, and one for the on-site repair technicians.
:::

To create a new appraisal template, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the upper-left corner. Next,
`configure the appraisal <../../marketing/surveys/create>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} by adding questions to the template.

Additionally, a new appraisal template can be created by duplicating the
default template, and making modifications to the copy. To duplicate the
template, navigate to `Appraisals
app --> Configuration --> Appraisal Templates`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then click on the template being duplicated.
Click the `fa-gear`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Actions)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, then click
`fa-clone`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Duplicate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

First, change the name of the template, then make any desired changes to
the template.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Appraisal templates are housed in the **Surveys** app. Any appraisal
template created *in* the **Appraisals** app must be configured to be
used with the **Appraisals** app, or it will *not* be available for
appraisals.

To ensure a new template is available for the **Appraisals** app,
navigate to the **Surveys** app, and click on the appraisal template.

Tick the radio button next to `Appraisal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} at the top of the survey. This setting allows the
survey to be used in the **Appraisals** app, and is visible in the
`Appraisal
Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu.

# Goals

The Odoo **Appraisals** application allows managers to set (and track)
clear goals for their employees. Continuous progress towards goals give
employees a concrete target between reviews, and give managers reliable
insights when evaluating performance.

## View goals

To view all goals, navigate to
`Appraisals app --> Goals`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. This
presents all the goals for every employee, in a default list view,
grouped by `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Click on an employee to expand the listed goals. Each goal displays the
following information:

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The name of the goal.
- `Created on`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The date the goal was
  made.
- `Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The percentage of
  progress the employee has achieved.
- `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The employee assigned
  to the goal.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Only employees with goals assigned to them appear in the list.
::::

![A list of goals for all employees.](goals/goal-list.png)

## Create goals {#appraisals/goal-card}

To create new goals, navigate to
`Appraisals app --> Goals`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the top-left corner to
open a blank goal form. Add the following information on the form:

- `Goal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Type in a brief name for
  the goal in this field.
- `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the employee being assigned the goal. Once this field is
  populated, the employee\'s manager populates the
  `Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
- `Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Click the current
  percentage of competency for the goal. The options are
  `0%`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `25%`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `50%`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `75%`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or `100%`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- `Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the employee\'s manager (if not already selected).
- `Deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the calendar
  selector, enter the due date for the goal.
- `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down menu,
  add any relevant `tags <appraisals/add-tags>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} to the goal.
- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab: Enter any
  details regarding the goal in this tab.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Some goals can be broken down into steps, which may be input as a
checklist. A checklist is a tool the employee may use to mark their
progress.
::::

![A completed goal created for learning Python.](goals/new-goal.png)

### Tags {#appraisals/add-tags}

Adding tags to goals can help when viewing the goals report, to see how
many goals with specific tags are assigned to employees.

To view all the current tags, and add new ones, navigate to
`Appraisals app -->
Configuration --> Tags`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. All
tags appear in a list view. The default tags are:
`External`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Hard Skills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Internal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Programming`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Soft Skills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Training`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To add a new tag, click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button in the upper-left corner, and a new line appears at the bottom of
the list. Enter the tag, then press return or click away from the field.

## Update goals

During employee appraisals, goals are reviewed to see how much progress
the employee has made. When an employee has achieved the next level of
progress, the goal must be updated accordingly.

To update a goal\'s progress percentage, navigate to
`Appraisals app --> Goals`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Expand the employee whose goals are being evaluated, and click on an
individual goal to open the goal record.

Click the new `Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box to set
the new progress level. It is recommended to add notes in the
`Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, as the employee
progresses with the goal. The notes should include dates the progress
changed, and any supporting information regarding the change.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Goal progress can be updated at any time by the employee\'s manager, not
only during an appraisal.
::::

## Complete goals

When a goal has been met, it is important to update the record. Navigate
to `Appraisals app --> Goals`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Expand the employee whose goals are being evaluated, and click on an
individual goal to open the goal record.

Click the `Mark as Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in
the upper-left corner. A green `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
banner appears in the top-right corner of the goal card, and the
`Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} changes to
`100%`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

On the `Goals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, completed
goals are indicated with a green `100%`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column.

# Conduct appraisals

This guide explains the end-to-end appraisal workflow in Odoo, from
creation to final rating, showing how managers and employees collaborate
at each stage.

- `Employee self-assessment <appraisals/employee-feedback>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: The employee completes the Employee\'s Feedback template
  and updates their skills. Responses remain hidden until the employee
  sets the form to *Visible to Manager*.
- `Manager feedback <appraisals/manager-feedback>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: While the employee works on their section, the manager
  reviews goals, gathers peer input if needed, and fills out the
  *Manager\'s Feedback* template. Feedback can remain hidden until the
  appraisal meeting.
- `Appraisal review <appraisals/review>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:
  Manager and employee meet to discuss both feedback sections, validate
  skill changes, and agree on next steps. The meeting can be scheduled
  directly from the appraisal or the calendar.
- `Completion and rating <appraisals/complete>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: After the discussion, the manager assigns a final rating,
  adds any private notes, and marks the appraisal Done. The record then
  locks unless it is reopened for further edits.

Throughout the process, optional actions, such as requesting peer
feedback or logging private manager notes, enhance the appraisal\'s
accuracy and relevance.

## Employee self-assessment {#appraisals/employee-feedback}

Once an appraisal is confirmed, the employee is required to fill out the
self-assessment.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Only confirmed appraisals can be worked on. If an appraisal is *not*
confirmed, the fields on the appraisal form cannot be edited, and
feedback cannot be recorded.
::::

After the employee receives a notification via email that an appraisal
is confirmed and scheduled, they are requested to fill out their half of
the default appraisal template, and update any skills.

Employee\'s can click on the link in the confirmation email to navigate
to the appraisal, or they can open their appraisal in the **Appraisals**
app. To do this, open the **Appraisals** app, then click on the
appraisal card.

The `Employee's Feedback`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} half of the
template includes the following sections: `My work`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `My future`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`My feelings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Each of these sections
consists of several questions for the employee to answer, allowing the
employee to perform a self-assessment, and provide feedback on how they
feel about the company and their role.

### Employee skills

After completing the
`Employee's Feedback <appraisals/employee-feedback>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} section in the `Appraisal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, the employee next updates their skills in the
`Skills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

Any skills that were present on the employee\'s record when the
appraisal was confirmed, appear in this tab. If a
`Skill Level`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} has changed since the
last appraisal, the level must be updated.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Skills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab does not appear on
the appraisal until the appraisal is confirmed.
::::

Click on the `Skill Level`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
skill that has changed, revealing a drop-down of all available levels.
Click on the new level for the skill. Once selected, the
`Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field updates accordingly.
Next, click into the `Justification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field for the skill, and enter any relevant details explaining the
change. This field is not necessary, but may aid management when
reviewing the employee\'s skills.

### Complete the self-assessment

The employee feedback remains hidden from management while the employee
is performing their self-assessment. Once the employee has completed
their half of the appraisal, and updated any skills, they tick the gray
`Not Visible to Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} toggle. This
changes the toggle text to `Visible to Manager`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, the color changes to green, and their responses are
then visible to management.

Additionally, a green dot appears on the appraisal card on the
**Appraisals** app dashboard, indicating the employee has completed
their assessment, and marked their half of the appraisal as done.

## Manager feedback {#appraisals/manager-feedback}

While the employee is completing their
`Employee's Feedback`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, the
manager fills out the `Manager's Feedback`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section.

Before the manager fills out their portion of the appraisal, managers
typically review the employee\'s goals and skills, and ask for
`additional feedback <appraisals/ask-feedback>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} from the employee\'s coworkers, to better understand all the
achievements and challenges for the employee.

Once the manager has all the information they need to evaluate the
employee, they fill out the `Manager's Feedback`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section of the appraisal form. The manager\'s half has
the following sections: `Feedback`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Evaluation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Improvements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The manager\'s appraisal focuses on the employee\'s accomplishments, as
well as identifying areas of improvements, with actionable steps to help
the employee achieve their goals in both the long and short term.

When the feedback section is completed, the manager can tick the
`Not Visible to Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} toggle.
This changes the toggle text to `Visible to Employee`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, the color changes to green, and their responses are
then visible to the employee.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Some managers prefer to keep their feedback hidden from the employee
until they `meet with
the employee <appraisals/review>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to
discuss the appraisal.
::::

### Ask for feedback {#appraisals/ask-feedback}

As part of the appraisal process, the manager can
`request feedback for an employee
<appraisals/360-request-feedback>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} from
anyone in the company about an employee. In Odoo, this is referred to as
*360 Feedback*.

Feedback is requested from coworkers and anyone else who works with the
employee. This is to get a more well-rounded view of the employee, and
aid in the manager\'s overall assessment.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To request feedback, the appraisal **must** be confirmed. Once
confirmed, an `Ask
Feedback`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button appears in the
upper-left corner of the form.
::::

## Appraisal review {#appraisals/review}

Once both portions of an appraisal are completed (the
`employee <appraisals/employee-feedback>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
and `manager <appraisals/manager-feedback>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} feedback sections), it is time for the employee and manager
to
`meet and discuss the appraisal <appraisals/schedule>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

During the appraisal meeting, the manager reviews both the
`Employee's Feedback
<appraisals/employee-feedback>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} section as
well as their own `Manager feedback
<appraisals/manager-feedback>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Additionally, the employee\'s
`skills <appraisals/skills>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`goals <goals>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} are reviewed at this time,
and updated as needed.

### Schedule appraisal review {#appraisals/schedule}

A meeting can be scheduled in one of two ways: either from the
**Appraisals** app dashboard, or from an individual appraisal card.

To schedule an appraisal from the dashboard of the **Appraisals** app,
first navigate to `Appraisals app --> Appraisals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Click the activity icon beneath the appraisal date on the desired
appraisal card, and an activity pop-up window appears. Click
`fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Schedule an activity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and set the
`Activity Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}[ to
:guilabel:\`Meeting]{.title-ref}. For more information on scheduling
activities, refer to the
`activities documentation <activities/all>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Doing so opens a `New Event`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
form. From this pop-up form, make any desired modifications, such as
designating a `Start`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} time.

The employee populates the `Attendees`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section by default. Add anyone else who should be in
the meeting, if necessary.

To make the meeting a video call, instead of an in-person meeting, click
`fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Odoo meeting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a
`Videocall URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} link appears in the
field.

Once all the desired changes are complete, click
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The meeting now appears on the calendar, and the invited parties are
informed, via email.

![The meeting form with all information entered for Ronnie Hart\'s annual appraisal.](new_appraisals/meeting.png)

The other way to schedule a meeting is from the individual appraisal
form. To do this, navigate to the `Appraisal app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} dashboard, then click on an appraisal card.

Next, click on the `fa-calendar`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Meeting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button, and the
calendar loads. Follow the same directions above to create the meeting.

For more detailed information on how to schedule activities, refer to
the `activities
<../../essentials/activities>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If no meetings are scheduled, the `Meeting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button reads `No Meeting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

### Review employee skills {#appraisals/skills}

Part of an appraisal is evaluating an employee\'s skills, and tracking
their progress over time. The `Skills`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of the appraisal form auto-populates with the
skills from the `employee
form <employees/skills>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, once an
appraisal is confirmed.

Each skill is grouped with like skills, and the
`Skill Level`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Justification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are displayed for
each skill.

`Update any skills, or add any new skills <employees/skills>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to the `Skills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

If a skill level has increased, enter a reason for the improved rating
in the `Justification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, such as
[took a fluency language test]{.title-ref} or [received Javascript
certification]{.title-ref}.

After an appraisal is completed, and the skills have been updated, the
next time an appraisal is confirmed, the updated skills populate the
`Skills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Skills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab *can* be modified
**after** the employee and their manager have met and discussed the
employee\'s appraisal.

This is a common situation as the manager may not have all the necessary
information to assess and update the employee\'s skills before meeting.
::::

## Complete an appraisal {#appraisals/complete}

After the appraisal has been filled out by both the employee and the
manager, and both parties have met and discussed the employee\'s
performance, the manager then `logs any notes
<appraisals/notes>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
`assigns a rating <appraisals/rate>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

When completed, click the `Mark as Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the upper-left corner of the appraisal form.

Once the appraisal is marked as *Done*, the status changes from
`Confirmed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Mark as Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button changes to a
`Reopen`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Modifications are **not** possible once the appraisal is marked as done.

To make any changes to an appraisal with a status of
`Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click the
`Reopen`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, then, click
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and make any modifications
needed. Once all modifications are complete, click the
`Mark as Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button again.
::::

### Add a private note {#appraisals/notes}

Managers can log notes on an appraisal that are **only** visible to
other managers. Enter any notes in the `Private Note`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. This can be done anytime during the appraisal
process.

The employee being evaluated does **not** have access to this tab, and
the tab does **not** appear on their appraisal.

The tab is optional and does not affect the final rating.

### Provide a final rating {#appraisals/rate}

After both the manager and employee have met to discuss the employee\'s
performance, the appraisal must be given a
`Final Rating`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Using the drop-down menu, select the rating for the employee. The
default options are: `Needs improvement`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Meets expectations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Exceeds expectations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Strongly Exceeds Expectations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `Good`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To add a new rating, navigate to
`Appraisals app --> Configuration --> Evaluation
Scale`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. The default ratings are
presented in a list view. To add a new rating, click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the upper-left
corner, and a blank line appears at the bottom of the list. Enter the
new rating, then press the enter key, or click away from the line. Add
as many new ratings as needed.

Click `Appraisals`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} in the top
menu to return to the `Appraisals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
dashboard, click on the appraisal, then select the desired
`Final Rating`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Schedule appraisals

Odoo\'s **Appraisals** app helps managers run recurring performance
reviews. Each review can include a self-assessment and can follow any
schedule the company sets.

Regular appraisals turn day-to-day work into clear goals and measurable
skill targets. They also supply the objective evidence HR needs for
raises or promotions, and keep individual performance aligned with
company KPIs.

Reviews can be
`scheduled automatically <appraisals/auto>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} through an `appraisal plan
<appraisals/appraisal-plan>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} that triggers
evaluations at set intervals, or `created manually
<appraisals/manual>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} whenever
needed---such as before a promotion or department transfer.

## Automatic scheduling {#appraisals/auto}

To ensure no appraisal is missed, enable automatic scheduling by going
to `Appraisals
app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

The `Appraisals Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} settings
determines the frequency that appraisals are scheduled.

![The appraisals sections with the timeline filled in and 360 feedback enabled.](schedule_appraisals/appraisals-setting.png)

### Appraisals plans {#appraisals/appraisal-plan}

By default, appraisals are preconfigured to be automatically created six
months after an employee is hired, with a second appraisal exactly six
months after that.

Once those two initial appraisals have been completed in the employee\'s
first year, following appraisals are only created once a year (every
twelve months).

To modify this schedule, change the number of months in the blank fields
under the `Appraisals Plans`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Changing the `Appraisals Plans`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
updates **every** employee record whose
`Next Appraisal Dates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is empty.
::::

### Appraisals automation

Tick the checkbox next to `Appraisals Automation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to have Odoo automatically schedule *and* confirm
appraisals.

Appraisals are scheduled according to the
`appraisal plan <appraisals/appraisal-plan>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

## Manually schedule an appraisal {#appraisals/manual}

Managers can schedule an appraisal at any time, outside the regular
cycle.

For example, if an employee is promoted, or transfers to a new role or a
new department, an appraisal is scheduled to assess performance in the
current role.

To create a new appraisal, open the `Appraisals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} app, and click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the upper-left corner. This opens a blank
`Appraisals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form.

First, using the drop-down menu, select the employee being evaluated, in
the first field on the form. Once an employee is selected, the
employee\'s `Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields are populated
according to the information on the employee record.

The current date populates the `Appraisal Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, which is the date the appraisal is scheduled to
be completed. Using the calendar selector, adjust the date, if desired.
This field is typically updated when the manager submits their final
rating at the end of the appraisal process.

If there is an
`appraisal plan <appraisals/appraisal-plan>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} configured, the `Next
Appraisal Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field displays
`Ongoing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This indicates that the
following appraisal will be scheduled according to the appraisal
schedule. Once the appraisal is marked as complete, the
`Next Appraisal Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is updated with
the date of the next appraisal.

Last, select the desired `Appraisal Template`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The `Default Template`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} populates this field, by default, and is created when
the **Appraisals** app is installed. Using the drop-down menu, select a
different template, if desired.

Once the information in the top-half of the
`Appraisals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form is complete, click
the `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
upper-left corner, and the appraisal is scheduled, and the employee is
notified.

Once the appraisal is confirmed, both the employee and manager can start
to fill out the appraisal.

![A new appraisal form with the top half filled out.](schedule_appraisals/new-appraisal.png)

# Skills evolution

In Odoo\'s **Appraisals** app, it is possible to view employee\'s skills
as they progress over time in the
`Skills Evolution <appraisals/identify-skills-evolution>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} report, also known as the *Appraisal Skills Report*.

Managers can use this to see who is achieving their various skill goals
set on their appraisals, who is meeting their skill deadlines, who has
the highest performance in terms of skill development, and more.

The *Skills Evolution* report also provides the ability to
`search for employees with specific
skills <appraisals/identify-skills>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} at
certain levels, which can be helpful for scenarios where specific skills
are required.

## Skills evolution report {#appraisals/identify-skills-evolution}

To access this *Skills Evolution* report, navigate to
`Appraisals app --> Reporting
--> Skills Evolution`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Doing so reveals the `Appraisal Skills Report`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page. All skills are grouped by the month they were
created, then by employee, and then by skill type.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Appraisals Skills Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} only
displays skills for employees with at least one completed appraisal.
Skills for employees whose appraisals are still draft or pending are not
included.

When an employee completes their first appraisal, all their skills
appear on the report. Once subsequent appraisals are marked as done, any
skill changes from the previous appraisal appear on the report.

Any skill level changes from ongoing appraisals that have **not** been
finalized are **not** included in this report.
::::

To view the specific details for an employee\'s skill types, expand the
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then expand the
individual `Skill Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Each skill
type displays the following information:

- `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the name of the
  employee.
- `Skill Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the category the
  skill falls under.
- `Skill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the specific, individual
  skill.
- `Current Level`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the current level
  the employee has achieved for the skill.
- `Previous Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the previous
  percentage of competency achieved for the skill.
- `Current Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the current
  percentage of competency achieved for the skill.
- `Justification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: any notes entered
  on the skill, explaining the progress.

The color of the skill text indicates any changes from the previous
appraisal. Skill levels that have increased since the last appraisal
appear in green, as an *Improvement*. Skill levels that have **not**
changed appear in black, as *No Change*. Skills that have regressed
appear in red, as *Regression*.

This report can be modified to find specific information by adjusting
the `filters
<search/filters>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`groupings <search/group>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} set in the
search bar at the top.

![A report showing all the skills grouped by employee.](skills_evolution/skills-report.png)

## Use case: Identify employees with specific skills {#appraisals/identify-skills}

Since the `Appraisal Skills Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
organizes all skills by month, then employee, it can be difficult to
find employees with a specific skill at a specific level. To find these
employees, a custom filter must be used.

In this example, the report is modified to show employees with an expert
level of Javascript knowledge. To view only those employees, first
remove all active filters in the search bar.

Next, click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Toggle Search Panel)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
search bar, then click `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} beneath the `fa-filters`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column to load an
`Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

Using the drop-down menu in the first field, select
`Skill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, keep the second field
as-is (`is in)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select
`Javascript`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the third drop-down
menu in the third field.

Next, click `New Rule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and another
line appears. In this second line, select
`Current Level`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the first
drop-down field, leave the second field as-is `(is
in)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then select
`Expert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the third drop-down
field.

After the second rule is added, navigate to the text at the top of the
pop-up window that shows `Match any`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`of the following rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click the
drop-down menu for `any`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and change
it to `all`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Finally, click the `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![The Custom Filter pop-up with the parameters set.](skills_evolution/javascript.png)

Now, only employees that have an `Expert`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} level for the skill `Javascript`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} appear. In this example, only
`Marc Demo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} meets these criteria.

![The employees with expert Javascript skills.](skills_evolution/results.png)

## Use case: Assess highest improvement

Another way to modify the `Appraisal Skills Report`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is to identify the employee who has the highest amount
of improved skills over a specific period of time.

To view this information, first remove the default filter in the search
bar. Next, click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Toggle Search Panel)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
search bar, then click `Improvement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
beneath the `fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. Enabling this
filter only presents skills that have improved.

It is possible to view the skills that have improved over a period of
time, such as a specific quarter, or month. With the search bar
drop-down menu still expanded, click `Add Custom
Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the bottom of the
`fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Filters`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column, and an `Add
Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears.

Select `Create Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the first
drop-down field, then select `is between`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for the second drop-down field. Once
`is between`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, a second
field appears after the last field. Using the calendar selector, select
the date range to apply the filter to. Once all the fields are properly
formatted, click `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The custom filter presents all skills that have been improved, organized
by employee, in a default list view.

::: example
To determine the employee with the most amount of improved skills for
the second quarter, remove the default filter in the search bar of the
`Appraisal Skills Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Next,
activate the `Improvement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter,
then click `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the
bottom of the `fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

In the resulting `Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window, select `Create Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
for the first drop-down field, then select
`is between`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the second drop-down
field. Two date fields appear after `is between`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is selected.

Using the calendar selector, set the first date to
`04/01/2025`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the second date to
`06/30/2025`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then click
`Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Custom Filter pop-up with the parameters set.](skills_evolution/custom-filter.png)
:::

To view the number of employees and skills in further detail, click the
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the top-right
corner to view the data in a pivot table. This presents a pivot table
with the employees populating the rows, and the only visible column
represents the total number of improved skills.

To expand the columns to view which skill types had the most overall
improvement, click `fa-plus-square`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} above the
`Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, then click
`Add Custom Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}, then click
`Skill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the resulting drop-down
menu. This expands all the improved skills, organized by individual
skill.

::: example
In this example, `Audrey Peterson`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
improved the most in the third quarter, with five improved skills.

# Attendance logs

When entering the **Attendances** application, the
`Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard is presented by
default, and displays all the user\'s attendance logs (their check in
and check out information) for the current day. If the user has the
required `access rights <attendances/access-rights>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or is an
`approver <attendances/approvers>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for
specific employees, those employees\' attendance logs also appear on the
`Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

The `Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard displays the
current day, segmented by hour, with the current hour highlighted in
yellow. The appearance of the `Overview`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard is determined by the
`working schedule <employees/schedule>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
set on the employee\'s records. Each employee\'s working hours appear in
white, while all other hours appear in gray. This allows managers to
visually determine if an employee is working outside of their working
hours.

Employees populate the rows, alphabetically by first name. Each
attendance log displays the total hours along with the specific check in
and check out times. The log colors indicate the following statuses:

- Gray: Completed entries where the employee has checked in and out.
- Green: Active entries where the employee checked in but has not yet
  checked out.
- Red: Entries with any errors (e.g. employees have double entries, or
  forget to check out).

![The overview dashboard presenting the information for the week, with the current day
highlighted.](attendance_logs/overview.png)

A color-coded bar indicates how many hours out of the total expected
hours the employee has logged for the day. Rollover the color bar to
view the details for the employee\'s current day. Solid colors indicate
the logged hours (with both a start and end time), while pale colors
indicate the employee is signed in, but has not signed out yet. Only
*completed* attendance logs (records with a check in and check out time)
appear in the summary of the logged time.

::: example
Abigail Peterson is scheduled to work from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, then
take a one-hour lunch break from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM, then work from
1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, for a total of eight hours.

Abigails checks in at 9:00 AM, and checks out at 12:00 PM. She logs in
again at 1:00 PM. The current time is 2:15 PM. The rollover information
displays [3h / 8h]{.title-ref}, indicating Abigail has logged three
completed working hours out of a total of eight. There is a pale green
line that extends past the summary block, indicating she checked in at
1:00 PM, but has not yet checked out. The length of the pale green line
indicates the time worked.

![The rollover green bar indicating Abigail logged 3 hours, and is currently logged in.](attendance_logs/status-bar.png)
:::

The **Attendances** dashboard allows for changing the displayed time
period, either `Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Week`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Month`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Quarter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or a custom time period. To
instantly return the dashboard to the present date, click the
`Today`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at any time.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Any attendance logs that have errors appear in red, indicating they need
to be resolved by a user with the proper
`access rights <attendances/access-rights>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or are `approvers
<attendances/approvers>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for the employees
with the errors.
::::

## Filters and groups {#attendances/filters-groups}

Sometimes, attendance officers and managers need to view specific
records, such as all automatic checkouts, to determine which employees
chronically forget to check out, or by department, to determine which
team is working the most overtime.

For these cases, use the search bar to select a
`fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Filters`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `oi-group`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or combine both to
present the desired information.

## Attendance log details {#attendances/errors}

Odoo records both the time and location for every check-in and
check-out, with fields varying by the method used. These detailed
attendance logs can confirm where an employee was on any given workday.
This can be useful for companies with hybrid working schedules, who may
need to perform audits to ensure proper compliance.

To view an attendance log, click on any attendance entry on the
`Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, and the
attendance log appears in a pop-up window. This log displays a summary,
including the following information:

- `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The name of the
  employee.
- `Check In`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The date and time the
  employee checked in.
- `Check Out`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The date and time the
  employee checked out. This **only** appears if the employee has
  checked out.
- `Worked Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The amount of time
  the employee logged for that specific entry, in an hour and minute
  format (HH:MM).
- `Worked Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The unpaid
  overtime hours worked beyond the expected working schedule for that
  specific entry (shows **only** when present for the employee).
- `Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The approved
  overtime for that specific entry (the `Worked
  Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} minus the approved
  `Worked Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The details on the attendance log pop-up window.](attendance_logs/attendance-log.png)

### Check in/check out details

Additional detailed check in and check out information for the
attendance log is available. Click the `fa-expand`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(expand)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
upper-right corner of the attendance log, and the detailed record loads.

The following additional information appears for both the *Check In* and
*Check Out* sections, which appear in the expanded attendance log.

- `Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The attendance submission
  method. The available options are:
  - `Systray`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The employee checked
    in or out `directly from the database
    <../attendances/check_in_check_out>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
  - `Kiosk`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The employee checked in
    or out using an `attendance kiosk
    <attendances/kiosk-mode-entry>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
  - `Manual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The employee\'s manager
    or an **Attendances** app administrator
    `manually created the attendance record <attendances/create-records>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}. This typically occurs when an employee forgets to check
    in or check out.
- `IP Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The device\'s IP
  address used to check in or out.
- `Browser`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The web browser the
  employee used to check in or out.
- `Localisation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The city and
  country associated with the computer\'s IP address.
- `GPS Coordinates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The specific
  coordinates when the user checked in or out. To view the specific
  coordinates on a map, click the `oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} `View on Maps`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
  beneath the `GPS Coordinates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This
  opens a map in a new browser tab, with the specific location pointed
  out.

![The detailed information for an attendance entry.](attendance_logs/details.png)

## Attendance errors

Entries that contain an error appear on the overview dashboard in red.
In the `fa-tasks`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Gantt)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view, the entry appears
with a red background; in the `oi-view-list`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(List)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view, the entry
text appears in red.

An error occurs when an employee has checked in but not checked out
within 24 hours, or when a single check-in period exceeds 16 hours.

To fix the error, the attendance entry must be modified or deleted.
Click on the entry to reveal a pop-up containing the details for that
particular entry. To modify the `Check In`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Check Out`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
information, click on the `Check In`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
or `Check Out`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and a calendar
selector appears. Click on the desired date, then use the time selector
beneath the calendar to select the specific time for the entry. When the
information is correct, click `Apply.`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}

When all the information on the pop-up is correct, click
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. When the entry no
longer has an error, the entry appears in gray instead of red.

To delete an entry, click the red `Delete`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the pop-up window instead of making
modifications to the entry.

# Attendance reporting

The **Attendances** app report helps managers find attendance issues
with employees before they become a problem. The report can give
insights on trends by determining `which employees are
working more overtime <attendances/overtime>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and who is `not working their full shifts
<attendances/absent>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

## View report

To view the attendance report, click `Reporting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the top menu. The default report displays attendance
information for current employees over the past three months, in a
default `oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Pivot table`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The rows are populated
by employee, while the columns are populated by the various attendance
records. All entries are grouped by month.

The columns presented are:

- `Worked Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The total logged
  time the employee worked for the month.
- `Expected Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The number of
  hours the employee should have worked for the month, calculated from
  their `working schedule <employees/schedule>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, configured on their employee form.
- `Difference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The difference from
  the `Expected Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
  `Worked Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the employee
  that month.
- `Balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The difference between
  the *approved* overtime, and the *total* overtime worked.

To present different information, adjust the filters and groups in the
same way as in the `Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
dashboard.

![The default report view, with all the optional view buttons highlighted.](attendance_%20reporting/reporting.png)

## Use case: monthly overtime {#attendances/overtime}

Overtime affects a company\'s bottom line, as most companies budget for
employee salaries. When salaries exceed the expected amount, companies
may see a rise in overhead costs when salary budgets are exceeded. This
is why the attendance report is needed, to ensure no excessive overtime
is logged.

To view a specific month\'s overtime, by employee, click
`Reporting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the top menu of the
**Attendances** app. Remove the default `oi-group`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Date: Month > Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
grouping in the search bar. Click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Toggle Search Panel)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon at the end of the search bar, then click
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and click the desired month.

Next, click the `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} button in the upper-left
corner, and deselect `Expected Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Worked Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This presents the
`Difference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} attendance data for the
selected month, grouped by employee.

The `Difference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} shows the month\'s
total overtime logged, and the `Balance`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} shows the portion still unapproved. Click the
`Difference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column to sort by the
amount of overtime. The highest positive number is the most overtime
logged for that month.

::: example
In the below example, a total of 38 hours and 53 minutes of overtime was
approved for the month of April. `Michael Williams`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} has the most overtime, with 10 hours and 25 minutes
logged. Of that overtime, only 25 minutes was unapproved, for a total of
ten paid overtime hours.

![The attendances report, showing only overtime for the month of April.](attendance_%20reporting/overtime.png)
:::

## Use case: absenteeism {#attendances/absent}

Employees with a negative `Difference`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} indicate that they have not worked their expected
shifts. This can be from forgetting to log in and out of work, or for
working less hours than expected, without any approved time off.

To view the attendance data for the last three months, to identify any
trends, first open the **Attendances** app report. Next, click the
`Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} button in the upper-left
corner, and ensure **only** `Difference`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is selected.

Next, reset the row data by clicking
`fa-minus-square-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the top of the rows. Then
click `fa-plus-square`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click the
`Difference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column name to sort by
the total difference in logged hours from the expected hours.

The employee who worked the least has the highest negative balance.
Click on any of the numbers for the employee to view the detailed
individual attendance records.

::: example
In the below example, the company has only been opened for two months,
so data is only available for the last two months, even though the
filter `Last 3 Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is active.

From this report, it is determined that
`Abigail Peterson`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} worked the least
amount of hours over the past two months, working 25 hours less than was
expected.

# Check in and out

Odoo\'s **Attendances** application allows users, who are logged into
the database, to check in and out without needing to go into the
**Attendances** application, or use a kiosk. For smaller companies,
where every employee is also a user, this feature may be useful.

A user can check in and/or out on the main database Odoo dashboard, or
while inside any application. To do so, in the upper-right corner of the
top main header menu, which is always visible regardless of what
application the user is in, a `fa-circle`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(red circle)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`fa-circle`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(green circle)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is visible. Click on
the colored circle to reveal the attendance widget, enabling the user to
check in or out.

## Check in {#attendances/check-in}

If the attendance widget circle is red, this indicates the user is not
currently checked in. Click the `fa-circle`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(red circle)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
attendance widget appears, displaying a green
`Check in`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-sign-in`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} button.

![Top right main menu with check in button highlighted.](check_in_check_out/check-in.png)

When the user checks in from the database, the **Attendances** app logs
the location details for the user, including the IP Address and GPS
coordinates.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

For the **Attendances** app to log the location details, the user must
allow their computer to access their location information.
::::

If the user has not already checked in and out during the current work
day, this button is the only visible item in the widget. If the user has
previously checked in and out, a `Total today`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field appears above the button, and the total amount of
time that has been logged for the day appears in that field, in an
`HH:MM`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (hours:minutes) format.

Click the `Check in`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-sign-in`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} button to check in. The
`fa-circle`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(red circle)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the top menu
changes to green, and the widget changes appearance, as well. The widget
updates to reflect that the user has checked in, by changing the green
`Check in`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-sign-in`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} button to a yellow
`Check out`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-sign-out`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} button.

Click anywhere on the screen to close the attendance widget.

## Check out

If the user is checking out for the first time,
`Since HH:MM (AM/PM)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears at the
top of the widget, with the time the user checked in populating the time
field. Beneath that line, the hours and minutes that have elapsed since
checking in are displayed in a `HH:MM`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} format. As time passes, this value is updated to
reflect the hours and minutes that have passed since the user checked
in.

If the user has previously checked in and out, additional fields are
presented. A `Before
HH:MM (AM/PM)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears, in
addition to the `Since HH:MM (AM/PM)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. The times displayed in both of these fields match, and are
populated with the most recent check in time. Beneath the
`Before HH:MM (AM/PM)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, the
previously logged time is displayed, in an `HH:MM`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} (hours:minutes) format.

In addition, beneath both of these fields, a
`Total today`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears. This
field is the sum of both the `Before HH:MM (AM/PM)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Since HH:MM (AM/PM)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} fields, and is the total time that is logged for the
user, if they were to log out at that moment.

As time passes, both the `Since HH:MM (AM/PM)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Total today`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
fields are updated live. To check out, click the yellow
`Check out`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-sign-out`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} button. The attendance
widget updates again, displaying the `Total today`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field with the logged time, while the yellow
`Check out`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-sign-out`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} button changes to a green
`Check in`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-sign-in`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} button.

When the user checks out from the database, the **Attendances** app logs
the location details for the user. This information is logged **only**
if the user grants permission.

![The pop-up that appears when an employee checks in inside the database.](check_in_check_out/check-in-database-message.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The number of times a user can check in and check out is unlimited.
Users can check in and out without any time elapsing (a value of 00:00).
Each time an employee logs in and out, the information is stored and
appears on the main **Attendances** dashboard, including check-ins and
check-outs with no time value.

# Hardware

Employees who are **not** database users, and therefore, do **not** have
access to the **Attendances** app, must sign in and out of work using a
kiosk. The following are the physical requirements for setting up a
kiosk.

## Kiosk devices

A kiosk is a self-service station, where employees can
`check in and out of work
<attendances/kiosk-mode-entry>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} with
either a `badge <attendances/hardware/badges>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or an
`RFID key fob <attendances/hardware/rfid>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Typically, these devices are dedicated as kiosks only, but
any device with an internet browser is able to be set up as a kiosk.

A kiosk is used by navigating to the webpage specified in the
`configuration
<attendances/kiosk-settings>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} section of
the **Attendances** app.

Kiosks are set up using one of the following types of devices:

- Laptop or Desktop computer
- Tablet
- Mobile phone (Android or iOS)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Touchscreens are easy to use, and tablets and mobile phones take up less
space. That is why most consider using a smaller device with a
touchscreen as a kiosk.

It is recommended to place kiosks on a secure stand, or mount them
securely on a wall.
::::

## Badges {#attendances/hardware/badges}

Badges are a way for employees to quickly sign in and out from a kiosk,
as badges are scanned by the kiosk\'s camera to identify the employee.

To generate a badge, first navigate to the
`Employees app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Next, click on
the desired employee card to open the employee\'s form, then click the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

Under the `ATTENDANCE/POINT OF SALE/MANUFACTURING`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, there is a `Badge
ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. If this field is blank,
click `Generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the end of the
`Badge ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line, and the field is
automatically populated with a new badge ID number. Then, click
`Print Badge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the end of the badge
ID number to create a PDF file of the badge.

If a badge ID number is already present on the employee form, there is
no `Generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, only a
`Print Badge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

The employee\'s badge contains the employee\'s photo, name, job
position, company logo, and a barcode that can be scanned at a kiosk to
check in and out.

Badges can be printed for employees using any thermal or inkjet printer.

![A badge for an employee that is created from the Employees app.](hardware/badge.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Badges are **not** required, as employees can manually identify
themselves on the kiosk.
::::

### Barcode scanners

When using badges to check in and out, the barcode **must** be scanned
to identify the employee. This can be done with the kiosk\'s camera, if
one is available on the device.

If a camera is **not** available on the kiosk device, an external
barcode scanner must be used to scan badges.

Kiosks work with most USB barcode scanners. Bluetooth barcode scanners
are also supported for devices without USB ports, or if a wireless
connection is desired.

Follow the manufacturer\'s instructions on the barcode scanner to
properly connect the barcode scanner to the kiosk device.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If the barcode scanner is connected directly to a computer, it
`must be configured
<../../inventory_and_mrp/barcode/setup/hardware>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to use the computer\'s keyboard layout.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

An IoT box is **not** required to use a barcode scanner.
::::

## RFID key fob readers {#attendances/hardware/rfid}

Instead of using a
`badge <attendances/hardware/badges>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
employees can scan a personal RFID key fob with an RFID reader to check
in and out of work.

It is **required** to purchase *both* RFID key fobs and an RFID reader
to use this method to check in and out. Follow the manufacturer\'s
directions to install the RFID reader, and set up the RFID key fob.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

An IoT box is **not** required to use RFID key fobs.

# Kiosks

Odoo\'s **Attendances** app allows employees to check in and out of work
directly from the database or a kiosk.

A kiosk is a `dedicated device <hardware>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
(a PC, tablet, or mobile phone) for employees to use when they check in
and out.

Kiosks are needed for employees who do **not** have access to the
database.

Only employees with access to the Odoo database can check in and out
from the **Attendances** app, and they are referred to as *users*.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If employees
`check in and out <attendances/kiosk-mode-entry>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} using a badge or an RFID, then an
`accessible device <hardware>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} in
`Kiosk Mode <attendances/kiosk-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
**must** be available in order to use these two methods.
::::

## Configuration

To use kiosks in the **Attendances** application, navigate to
`Attendances app -->
Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. On the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, configure the
`Modes section
<attendances/kiosk-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and the
`attendances/kiosk-settings`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Once all desired settings have been configured, click the
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, to activate and
enable them.

### Modes section {#attendances/kiosk-mode}

Determine how an employee checks in when using a kiosk, either by
searching for their name on the kiosk
(`Manual Selection`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), scanning an
employee ID or key fob (`Barcode/RFID`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}). or both.

On the settings page, using the drop-down menu for the
`Kiosk Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-building-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} field in the
`Modes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, make the desired
selection. Options are `Barcode/RFID`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Barcode/RFID and Manual Selection`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Manual
Selection`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The **Barcode** application **does not** need to be installed to use one
of the Barcode/RFID settings.
::::

### Kiosk Settings section {#attendances/kiosk-settings}

The various settings in the `Kiosk Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section determine how employees check in and out with
kiosks.

- `Barcode Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  `fa-building-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}: this setting **only**
  appears if one of the two *Barcode/RFID* selections were configured
  for the `Kiosk Mode <attendances/kiosk-mode>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} setting.

  If available, select how barcodes are scanned at the kiosk, via one of
  the drop-down menu options. Barcodes can be scanned with a dedicated
  `Scanner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or with a device\'s
  camera (`Front Camera`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Back Camera`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

- `Display Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  `fa-building-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}: determine how many
  seconds a check-in/check-out confirmation message remains on the kiosk
  screen before returning to the main check in screen.

- `Employee PIN Identification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: tick
  this checkbox if employees should use a unique PIN to check in. PINs
  are configured on each individual employee record. Refer to the `new
  employee documentation <employees/hr-settings>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} documentation for more information on setting up PINs.

- `Attendance Kiosk Url`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Odoo
  generates a unique web address (URL) to use a device as a kiosk,
  without having to sign in to the Odoo database. When setting up a
  kiosk device, navigate to this unique web address in a web browser to
  present the **Attendances** app kiosk.

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  These kiosk URLs are **not** secured with any type of access code.
  Anyone who has the URL can access the **Attendances** app kiosk. If
  the URL is compromised for any reason, such as in the event of a
  security breach, click `fa-refresh`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Generate new URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, located beneath
  the link, to generate a new URL, and update the kiosk, accordingly.
  ::::

## Kiosk mode {#attendances/enable-kiosk-mode}

Entering *Kiosk Mode* is **only** available for users with specific
`access rights
<attendances/access-rights>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

*Kiosk Mode* can be activated in two different ways:

1.  Navigate to the `Attendances app`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}, and click `Kiosk Mode`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} in the top menu. The device then signs out of Odoo
    and enters *Kiosk Mode*.
2.  Navigate to the
    `Attendances app --> Configuration`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}. In the `Kiosk
    Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, use the link
    in the `Attendance Kiosk Url`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    field to open *Kiosk Mode* on any device.

![The Attendances Kiosk URL field in the settings section of the Attendances application.](kiosks/kiosk-url.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

As a security measure, once a device is in *Kiosk Mode*, it is not
possible to go back into the database without signing back in.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

At any time, a new kiosk URL can be generated, if needed. Click the
`fa-refresh`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Generate a new Kiosk Mode URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
::::

To exit *Kiosk Mode*, either close the tab in the web browser or return
to the main log-in screen of Odoo.

## Check in and out with a kiosk {#attendances/kiosk-mode-entry}

### Badge

To check in or out using a badge, tap the `fa-barcode`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Scan your badge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} image
in the center of the kiosk.

![The Attendances Kiosk view displaying the scan badge image.](kiosks/scan-badge.png)

Then, scan the barcode on the badge using the method configured in the
`Kiosk Settings
<attendances/kiosk-settings>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} section of
the configuration menu.

Once the barcode is scanned, the employee is checked in or out, and a
`confirmation message
<attendances/confirmation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} appears with
all the information.

### RFID

To check in or out using an RFID key fob, scan the fob with an RFID
reader.

Once scanned, the employee is either checked in or checked out, and a
`confirmation message
<attendances/confirmation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} appears with
all the information.

### Manually

Users who do not have a scannable badge, or an RFID fob, can manually
check in and out at a kiosk.

Tap the `fa-user-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Identify Manually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
kiosk, and a screen appears with all the employees that can be checked
in or out. The **Employees** app dashboard has the same display.

Tap on a person to check them in or out, and a `confirmation message
<attendances/confirmation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} appears.

To find a specific person, either:

- Search: tap into the search bar and enter the desired person\'s name.
  As the name is typed in, the matching results are displayed on the
  screen.
- By department: tap on any desired selection in the department section,
  located on the left side of the screen, to **only** view employees
  from that specific department. The number at the end of each listed
  department represents how many employees that department has.

#### PIN

If the `Employee PIN Identification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox was ticked in the `Kiosk Settings
<attendances/kiosk-settings>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} section of
the configuration menu, the employee is prompted to enter a PIN when
manually checking in or out.

After the employee is selected, a number pad appears with a message.
When checking in,
`(Employee) Please enter your PIN to check in`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} appears above the numbers. When checking out,
`(Employee) Please enter your PIN to check out`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} appears above the numbers.

Tap in the PIN using the number pad, then tap `OK`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} when done. The employee is then checked in or out, and
a `confirmation message <attendances/confirmation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} appears.

![The pop-up that appears when prompted to enter a pin.](kiosks/enter-pin.png)

### Confirmation message {#attendances/confirmation}

When an employee checks in or out, a confirmation message appears, with
all the check in or check out information.

When checking in, the `Welcome (Employee)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} message appears, along with the current date and time.
If the employee has already checked in and out that day, an
`Hours Previously
Today: HH:MM`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} message also appears,
showing the total hours logged earlier.

When checking out, `Goodbye (Employee)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} appears, as well as the date and time of check out.
Beneath the message is an `Hours Today: HH:MM`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, with the total hours and minutes logged for the
day.

Beneath both the \"welcome\" and \"goodbye\" messages is an
`OK`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. To exit the screen
before the preset time in the kiosk, tap the `OK`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

![The goodbye message with all the employee\'s check out information.](kiosks/goodbye-message.png)

Odoo\'s **Attendances** app requires management oversight in order to
ensure all logged attendances are correct, especially overtime hours and
incomplete shifts.

## Management dashboard {#attendances/dashboard}

All attendance records that require approval, typically due to
overlapping work entries or unapproved time off, are managed from a
centralized management dashboard. To access this, navigate to
`Attendances app --> Management`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

The `Management`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard only
displays attendance records for current employees that need to be
approved, in a default list view. This is due to the two default filters
in the search bar, the `To Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Active Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Each attendance record displays the following information:

- `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the name of the
  employee
- `Check In`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date and time the
  employee checked in
- `Check Out`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date and time the
  employee checked out
- `Worked Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the number of worked
  hours the employee logged
- `Worked Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the amount of
  overtime worked
- `Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total extra
  hours logged
- `Overtime Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the status of
  the attendance record. All attendance records that appear on this
  dashboard have a status of `To Approve`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.

![The Attendances app Management dashboard, displaying entries needing approval.](management/management-dashboard.png)

## Approvals and refusals {#attendances/approve-refuse}

Attendance records can be approved and refused directly from the
`Management dashboard
<attendances/dashboard>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. At the far-right
of each record, `fa-check`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`fa-times`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Refuse`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} buttons appear. Click the corresponding button to
either approve or refuse the logged attendance record.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When approving or refusing attendance records from the
`Management`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, it is **not**
possible to view the details of the attendance record.
::::

### Partial approvals

It is possible to approve a portion of the logged
`Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and not the full
amount. To approve only a portion of overtime, click into an attendance
record to view the details.

Click into the `Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
and enter the amount of hours being approved. After editing the
`Extra Hours field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Worked Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field becomes
visible to display the difference between the
`Worked Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Worked Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is the total
hours the employee logged (the `Worked
Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} combined). For example,
if an employee is scheduled to work eight hours, and worked five extra
hours, the `Worked Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is thirteen
hours, and the `Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is five
hours. The `worked Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
**cannot** be modified.
::::

Click `fa-check`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to approve the updated
`Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Once partially
approved, the `Worked Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field disappears, along with the `fa-check`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. The
difference in hours appears in the `Extra
Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Once overtime hours are partially approved, the status changes to
`Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![A detailed attendance record.](management/record.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Once partial overtime is approved, it is still possible to deny overtime
by clicking `fa-times`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The record can be modified
as many times as needed.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Occasionally, verifying an employee\'s location when checking-in may be
needed. The method the employee checked-in to work is found on the
individual record, in the `Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

The `Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is not modifiable,
as it only log the method the attendance record was created.

The possible options are:

- `Kiosk`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the employee physically
  checked in or out using a `kiosk <kiosks>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} device. The employee was present at the kiosk to check-in.
- `Systray`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the employee checked in
  or out `directly from the database
  <check_in_check_out>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. Depending on the
  `IP Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} displayed on the
  detailed attendance record, the employee\'s location at the time of
  check-in can be determined.
- `Manual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the record was created
  manually in the **Attendances** app. This is typically done by
  management, to add a missing record.
::::

## Create attendance records {#attendances/create-records}

When necessary, users with the required
`access rights <employees/work-info-tab>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
are able to create attendance records manually in the **Attendances**
app. Some situations requiring this is when employees forget to check in
and out for shifts, as employees cannot retroactively create attendance
records.

To add a missing attendance record, navigate to
`Attendances app --> Overview`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
upper-left corner. In the `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window, enter the following information on the form:

- `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the employee the
  record is being created for. The signed-in user populates this field,
  by default.
- `Check In`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: using the calendar
  modal, select the check in date and time, then click
  `fa-check`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Apply`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. By default, the current date is selected, and the
  time is set to [00:00:00]{.title-ref}.
- `Check Out`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: using the calendar
  modal, select the check out date and time, then click
  `fa-check`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Apply`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. By default, the following date is selected, and the
  time is set to [00:00:00]{.title-ref}.
- `Worked Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field is
  automatically populated with the difference from the selected
  `Check In`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Check Out`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} times. This field
  **cannot** be modified.
- `Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the number of
  overtime hours, if any, to be approved.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Once `Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are added, they
are automatically approved by the system. However, it is possible to
manually refuse them, as explained in the `Approvals and Refusals
<attendances/approve-refuse>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} section.

# Attendances

Odoo\'s **Attendances** application functions as a time clock. Employees
are able to check in and out of work using a
`dedicated device in kiosk mode <attendances/kiosk-mode-entry>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, while users are also able to check in and out of work
`directly from the database <attendances/check-in>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Managers can see who is available at any given time, create
reports to see everyone\'s hours, and gain insights on which employees
are working overtime or checking out of work earlier than expected.

## Access rights {#attendances/access-rights}

Understanding access rights is essential to navigating the
**Attendances** application.

Every user in the database is able to check in and out directly from the
database, without needing access to the **Attendances** app.
Additionally, all users can access their own attendance records from
their employee form in the **Employees** app.

Access to both the **Attendances** application and the various features
within the application is determined by access rights.

To see what access rights a user has, navigate to the
`Settings app --> Users &
Companies --> Users`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click
on an individual user. The `Access Rights`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab is visible by default. Scroll down to the *Human
Resources* section to view the settings. For the
`Attendances`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, the following
options appear:

- `No`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The user does **not** have
  access to the **Attendances** application, and is **not** able to open
  the app, even though it appears on the main database dashboard. An
  *Access Error* pop-up message appears when the application is clicked.
  The user can only check in and out of the database either through an
  `attendance kiosk <attendances/kiosk-mode-entry>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} or the
  `attendance icon <attendances/check_in_check_out>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} in the top-right corner of the Odoo database, which is
  visible at all times, in every application).
- `Officer: Manage all attendances`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  The user has full access to all employee attendance records, including
  the ability to modify and create records, but does **not** have access
  to the configuration menu and settings.
- `Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The user has full
  access to the entire **Attendances** application, with no
  restrictions. They can view all employee attendance records, enter
  `kiosk mode
  <attendances/enable-kiosk-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} from
  the application, access all `reporting
  <attendances/attendance_reporting>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
  metrics, and make modifications to the settings.

### Approvers {#attendances/approvers}

An approver is a user assigned to review and manage an employee\'s
attendance records. An approver is typically a manager, though that is
not required. Approvers without administrative rights can access and
modify attendance records **only** for the employees they are assigned
to. This is the only exception where non-admin users can view records in
the **Attendances** app.

To view the attendance approver for an employee, navigate to the
`Employees`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} application and
click on the specific employee. Click on the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, scroll to the
*Approvers* section, and check the `Attendance`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. The person selected is able to view that
employee\'s attendance records, both on the **Attendances** application
dashboard as well as in the attendance reports, and make modifications
to their records.

## Configuration

Few configurations are needed in the **Attendances** app. Determining
how employees check in and out, defining how the kiosks function, and
determining how extra hours are computed are all configured in the
settings menu. Navigate to the `Attendances app --> Configuration
--> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} to access the
settings menu.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Any configuration item with a `fa-building-o`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(building)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon is a
company-specific configuration. Items without a
`fa-building-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(building)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon apply to all
companies within the database.
::::

### Modes {#attendances/modes}

This section specifies how employees log in and out, and how absences
are handled.

- `Attendances from Backend`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  `fa-building-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}: Activate this feature
  to allow users to check in and out directly from the Odoo database. If
  this is not activated, users must use a kiosk to check in and out of
  work.

- `Automatic Check-Out`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  `fa-building-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}: Activate this feature
  to automatically check out employees according to their working
  schedule, after a buffer of time has passed. When enabled, a
  `Tolerance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears below
  this option. Enter the amount of time, in hours, that must elapse
  after an employee\'s working hours have ended, before they are
  automatically checked out.

  ::: example
  With the `Automatic Check-Out`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  option enabled, and the `Tolerance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  set to [2.00]{.title-ref} hours, an employee checks in to work at 9:00
  AM and forgets to check out at 5:00 PM. At 7:00 PM, they are
  automatically checked out.
  :::

- `Absence Management`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  `fa-building-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}: Activate this feature
  to log any absences that are not associated with a time off request,
  such as vacation time or sick time, on the
  `attendance report <attendances/attendance_reporting>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}. This does **not** apply for employees with a flexible
  working schedule.

### Extra Hours

This section specifies how extra time (sometimes referred to as
*overtime*) is calculated, including when extra time is counted and what
time is not logged.

- `Tolerance Time In Favor Of Company`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: Enter the amount of time, in minutes, that is
  **not** counted towards an employee\'s overtime. When an employee
  checks out, and the extra time logged is below the specified minutes,
  the extra time is **not** counted as overtime for the employee. When
  an employee checks out, and the extra time logged is more than the
  specified minutes, the extra time **is** counted as overtime for the
  employee.

  ::: example
  A company sets the
  `Tolerance Time In Favor Of Company`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to [15]{.title-ref} minutes, and the working hours
  for the entire company are set from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.

  An employee checks in at 9:00 AM. If the employee checks out at 5:14
  PM, the extra 14 minutes are **not** counted towards their overtime.
  If the employee checks out at 5:17 PM, they earn 17 minutes of
  overtime.
  :::

- `Tolerance Time In Favor Of Employee`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: Enter the amount of time, in minutes, that an
  employee is given, which does **not** adversely affect their
  attendance if they log less time than their working hours. When an
  employee checks out, and the total time logged for the day is less
  than their specified working hours and less than this specified grace
  period, they are **not** penalized for their reduced hours. When an
  employee checks out, and the total time logged for the day is less
  than their specified working hours and more than this specified grace
  period, they **are** penalized for their reduced hours.

  ::: example
  A company sets the
  `Tolerance Time In Favor Of Employee`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} fields to [15]{.title-ref} minutes, and the working
  hours for the entire company are set from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.

  An employee checks in at 9:05 AM. If the employee checks out at 4:55
  PM, even though they logged a total of 10 minutes less than their full
  working hours, they are **not** penalized for this discrepancy, and
  they are logged as working a full eight-hour day. If the employee
  checks out at 4:40 PM, they **are** penalized, and they are logged as
  only working 7 hours and 35 minutes.
  :::

- `Extra Hours Validation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  `fa-building-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}: Click on either the
  radio button next to `Automatically Approved`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to have all extra time automatically approved, or
  `Approved by Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if all extra
  time should be reviewed and approved by a manager.

- `Display Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Activate
  this box to display the extra hours logged by an employee when they
  check out with a kiosk, or when a user checks out in the database.

:::: note

Approved extra hours can be `deducted from an approved time off request

# Badges

In Odoo, employees can earn badges, either automatically through
`challenges created in the CRM
app <../../sales/crm/optimize/gamification>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, through **eLearning** courses, or manually, as managers
decide to award them.

Badges are a way to gamify the work day, can be created for any reason,
and can be granted to any user.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Badges can **only** be awarded to
`users of the database <../../general/users>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, *and* if the **eLearning** app is installed.
::::

## View available badges

To view the available badges that are configured by default, navigate to
`Employees
app --> Configuration --> Badges`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

All badges appear in a default Kanban view, with the badge\'s
`Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and image displayed.
Additionally, the number of users awarded the badge for both the current
month, and in total, appears, along with the badge description, and the
avatar for each user who received the badge.

Each badge has a `Grant`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
`award the badge <employees/grant_badge>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
from the `Badges`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

![All the available badges, on the Badges dashboard.](badges/badges.png)

## Create badges

Badges can be created in the database when the default badges are not
sufficient. This can be done from the `Badges`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard in the **Employees** app, or from the **CRM**
app.

To add a badge in the **Employees** app, first navigate to
`Employees app -->
Configuration --> Badges`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, then
click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
upper-left corner.

Fill out the badge form as outlined in the
`CRM documentation <crm/create-rewards>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

## View employee badges

To view badges awarded to an employee, open the **Employees** app, and
click on an employee record. Click on the
`Received Badges`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to view any
awarded badges.

:::: note

If this tab is not visible, it means there is no
`Related User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Once a user is
populated in the `Related User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, the `Badges`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab appears.
::::

## Grant badges {#employees/grant_badge}

To grant a badge to an employee, open the employee record, and click
into the `Received
Badges`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Click the
`Grant a Badge`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to load a
`Reward Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

Using the drop-down menu, select the badge being awarded in the
`What are you thankful
for?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. The default options are
`Good Job`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Problem Solver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Brilliant`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note

Note
:::

Additional options appear (e.g., `Get Started`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Power user`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`community Hero`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) which are
associated with challenges. These are automatically granted through
completed challenges. While these can be awarded at any time, it is
advised to grant badges manually that are *not* associated with a
challenge.

Next, enter a brief summary of why the badge is being granted in the
field displaying
`Describe what they did and why it matters (will be public)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. Last, click the
`Reward Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and the
badge is awarded, and is visible in the `Badges`{.interpreted-text

# Certifications

When jobs require specific knowledge, it is necessary to track employee
certifications to ensure the necessary knowledge and certifications are
in place.

When jobs require specific knowledge, track employee certifications
(e.g., classes, tests, seminars) to verify required skills. Odoo accepts
any certification type without restriction.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To add certifications to an employee profile, and to access the
*Employee Certifications* report, the **Surveys** app **must** be
installed.
::::

## View certifications

To view a full list of all employee certifications, navigate to
`Employees app -->
Reporting --> Certifications`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

All certifications appear in a list view, grouped by employee. Each
certification entry displays the following:

- `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the employee\'s name,
  along with their avatar image.
- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the title of the
  certification.
- `Validity Start`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: when the employee
  received the certification.
- `Validity End`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: when the
  certification expires.
- `Certification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the corresponding
  course in the **Surveys** app that was completed by the employee, if
  applicable.

The entries are also color-coded. Current certifications that are still
valid appear in black, expired certifications appear in red, and
certifications that are going to expire within the next 90 days appear
in orange.

![The list of employee certifications.](certifications/certifications.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

**Only** certification records with the *Display Type* set to
*Certification* on their
`certification form <employees/certifications-form>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} appear on the `Employee
Certifications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report. All other
certifications appear in the resume section of the
`employee form <employees/resume>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

### View certifications by expiration status

When managing a large number of employees with a variety of
certifications, it can be difficult to determine which employees need to
keep necessary certifications current in the default list view. In this
scenario, it is beneficial to view the certifications by expiration
status.

To do so, navigate to
`Employees app --> Reporting --> Certifications`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Next, click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Toggle Search Panel)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon in the search bar, then click `Add Custom Group`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"},
revealing a drop-down menu. Click `Expiration Status`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, then click away from the drop-down menu to close it.

After doing so, all the certifications are organized by status, starting
with `Expired`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} certifications, then
certifications that are `Expiring`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
soon (within the next 90 days), and lastly, certifications that are
still `Valid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Filter certifications by expiration status to identify certifications
expiring soon, and identify employees who must renew.

![The list of employee certifications, grouped by status.](certifications/status.png)

## Log a certification {#employees/certifications-form}

To log a certification for an employee, navigate to
`Employees app --> Learning -->
Certifications`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a blank certification form
loads. Enter the following information on the form:

- `Title`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a short description
  for the certification in this field.

- `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the employee who received the certification.

- `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down menu,
  select the type of certification received. This field determines where
  on the employee\'s resume the certification appears. To create a new
  `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, enter the type in the
  field, then click `Create [type]`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  The default options are:

  - `Experience`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this option
    to have the certification appear in the *Experience* section of the
    *Resume* tab on the `employee form <new_employee>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}. Experience entries are typically previous jobs or
    internships.
  - `Education`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this option
    to have the certification appear in the *Education* section of the
    *Resume* tab on the `employee form <new_employee>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}.
  - `Social Media`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this
    option to have the certification appear in the *Social Media*
    section of the *Resume* tab on the
    `employee form <new_employee>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. Social
    Media entries typically relate to certifications relating to digital
    marketing, social media management, and specific trainings from
    social media platforms.
  - `Internal Certification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
    this option to have the certification appear in the *Internal
    Certification* section of the *Resume* tab on the
    `employee form <new_employee>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
    Internal certifications entries are tied to courses, training, or
    programs created by the company, that once completed, have a
    certification associated with it.
  - `Completed Internal Training`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    Select this option to have the certification appear in the
    *Completed Internal Training* section of the *Resume* tab on the
    `employee form
    <new_employee>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. Completed internal
    training entries are typically associated with trainings created by
    the company, for company-specific processes. These do not result in
    any certifications, but are logged on the employee profile to
    indicate completed training.

- `Display Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  visibility of the certification in this field. The default options
  are:

  - `Classic`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this option to
    have the certification appear in the *Resume* section of the
    employee form, and **not** appear on the *Employee Certifications*
    report.
  - `Certification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select this
    option to have the certification appear in the *Resume* section of
    the employee form, **and** appear on the *Employee Certifications*
    report. Once this is selected, a `Certification`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field appears beneath the
    `Display Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Using the
    drop-down menu, select the corresponding **Surveys** app
    certification the employee took. This field **only** appears if the
    **Surveys** app is installed.
  - `Course`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this option to
    have the certification appear in the *Resume* section of the
    employee form, and **not** appear on the *Employee Certifications*
    report. Once this option is selected, a `Course`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field appears beneath the
    `Display Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Using the
    drop-down menu, select the corresponding **eLearning** course the
    employee took. This field **only** appears if the **eLearning** app
    is installed.

- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a description
  for the certification in this field.

- `Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Click into the first

# Equipment

Many employees are given various items to use while they work, such as
laptops, phones, and printers. Most companies track their equipment, to
see who is using what, as well as having a record of important
information regarding the equipment, such as serial numbers, warranty
information, and maintenance history.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To track employee equipment, the **Maintenance** app *must* be
installed.
::::

## Individual employee equipment {#employees/equipment}

Employee equipment is tracked on the employee record. To view all
equipment currently assigned to an employee, navigate to the
`Employees`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, and click on
the desired employee record.

At the top of the record, an `fa-cubes`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Equipment Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button
appears, with a number indicating how many, if any, items are currently
assigned to that employee.

Click the `fa-cubes`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Equipment Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button, and
all equipment currently assigned to the employee appears in individual
Kanban cards.

Each Kanban card displays the equipment\'s name and model on the first
line, followed by the serial number (if available), and lastly, the
employee\'s name. Any current maintenance requests appear at the bottom
of the card in a red box.

![A Kanban view of all equipment for an employee.](equipment/equipment.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

A serial number is **not** required when logging equipment.
::::

## All employee equipment

To view all equipment for all employees, start on the
`equipment record of an individual
employee <employees/equipment>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It does not matter what employee is selected, or whether they have any
equipment assigned to them. This step is only used to get to the
`Equipment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list.
::::

In the Kanban view of the employee\'s equipment, clear the default
`Assigned Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter in the
search bar. This presents *all* equipment in the database, including
those assigned to individual employees and whole departments.

Click into the search bar, and select `Employee`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `oi-group`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Group
By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. The equipment is now
organized in a Kanban view, by employee.

In the Kanban view displaying all employee equipment records, equipment
can be reassigned by clicking and dragging an equipment card to the
desired employee. This changes ownership of the equipment.

![A Kanban view of all equipment for all employees.](equipment/all-equipment.png)

## Add equipment to an employee record

To add equipment to an employee\'s record, open the
`Employees`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, click on the
desired employee record, then click the `fa-cubes`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Equipment Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button at the top.

All equipment currently assigned to the employee appears in individual
Kanban cards. To add a new equipment record, click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the upper-left
corner, and a blank `Equipment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form
loads.

`Fill out the equipment form <../../inventory_and_mrp/maintenance/add_new_equipment>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for the employee\'s equipment.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Instead of filling out a new `Equipment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} form for the same item, a form can be duplicated, then
updated.

On the `Equipment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form, click the
`fa-gear`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Actions)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon in the upper-left corner, then select
`fa-clone`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Duplicate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

An identical form appears, with *all* the information filled out, except
for the `Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Enter the `Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
form, and make any other necessary changes, such as the assigned
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# New employees

When a new employee is hired, the first step is to create a new employee
record. This record is a centralized place where all important
information about the employee is stored, including
`general information <employees/general-info>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `job history and skills
<employees/resume>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`various work information <employees/work-info-tab>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `personal
details <employees/private-info>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`payroll-related information <employees/payroll>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and various
`settings <employees/hr-settings>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} that
affect integrations with other apps in the database.

To begin, open the `Employees`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
app, then click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in
the upper-left corner. Doing so reveals a blank employee form.

Proceed to fill out the required information, along with any additional
details.

![Create a new employee form with all fields filled out.](new_employee/new-employee-form.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The current company phone number and name are populated in the
`Work Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields. If the
**Appraisals** application is installed, the `Next
Appraisal Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is populated
with a date six months from the current date.
::::

## General information {#employees/general-info}

Fill out the following employee details.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The employee form automatically saves as data is entered. However, the
form can be saved manually at any time by clicking the
`fa-cloud-upload`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Save manually)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon.
::::

- `Employee's Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the
  employee\'s name. This field is required.

- `Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field appears
  below the employee name and can be filled in manually. Alternatively,
  select a position from the drop-down menu in the
  `Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field beneath the
  `Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to auto-populate
  the top field. The two fields do not need to match.

  ::: example
  While it is recommended to have the job positions match, the typed-in
  description in this top field can contain more specific information
  than the selected drop-down `Job
  Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, if desired.

  For instance, if someone is hired for a sales representative position
  configured as `Sales Representative`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} in the **Recruitment** app, that can be selected in
  the drop-down `Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

  In the typed-in `Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  field beneath the `Employee's Name`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, the position can be more specific, such as [Sales
  Representative - Subscriptions]{.title-ref} if the employee is focused
  solely on subscription sales.

  ![Both job position fields entered but with different information.](new_employee/job-description-fields.png)
  :::

- `Photo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: in the top-right image box
  of the employee form, click on the `fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} `(Edit)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, then
  select a photo to upload.

- *Work Contact Information*: enter the employee\'s
  `Work Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Work Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Work Mobile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, information, if not
  already auto-populated.

- `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select a tag from the
  drop-down menu to add relevant tags to the employee. Any tag can be
  created in this field by typing it in. Once created, the new tag is
  available for all employee records. There is no limit to the amount of
  tags that can be added on an employee form.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: from the drop-down menu
  in this field, select the company the new employee was hired by, or
  create a new company by typing the name in the field, and clicking
  `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the mini
  drop-down menu that appears. This field is required.

- `Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the
  employee\'s department from the drop-down menu.

- `Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the
  employee\'s job position from the drop-down menu. If using the
  **Recruitment** app, this list reflects configured job positions. Once
  a selection is made, the `Job Position`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field beneath the `Employee's Name`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field automatically updates to reflect the currently
  selected job position, but is still editable.

- `Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the employee\'s
  manager from the drop-down menu.

- `Coach`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the employee\'s
  coach from the drop-down menu.

- `Next Appraisal Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field
  is **only** visible if the **Appraisals** application is installed.
  The date automatically populates with a date that is computed
  according to the settings configured in the **Appraisals**
  application. This date can be modified using the calendar selector.

:::: note

After a `Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, the
department\'s configured manager and coach automatically populates the

### Skills {#employees/skills}

An employee\'s skills can be entered in the `Resumé`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab in the same manner that a resumé line is created.

In order to add a skill to an employee record, the skill types must
first be configured. By default, Odoo comes with two
`Skill Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} preconfigured:
*Languages* and *Soft Skills*.
`Configure the rest of the skill types <employees/skill-types>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} before adding any skills to the employee record.

When adding the first skill to an employee record, a
`Pick a skill from the list`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
appears in the `Skills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of
the `Resumé`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Click the `Pick a
skill from the list`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and
select the following information for each skill.

- `Skill Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select a
  `skill type <employees/skill-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} by
  clicking the radio button next to the skill type.

- `Skill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: after selecting a
  `Skill Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the corresponding
  skills associated with that selected `Skill Type`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} appear in a drop-down menu. For example, selecting
  `Language`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as the
  `Skill Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} presents a variety of
  languages to select from under the `Skills`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field. Select the appropriate preconfigured skill
  from the list.

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  If the desired skill does not appear in the list, it is **not**
  possible to add the new skill from this window. New skills must be
  added from the `Skill Types <employees/skill-types>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} dashboard.
  ::::

- `Skill Level`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: pre-defined skill
  levels associated with the selected `Skill
  Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appear in a drop-down menu.
  First, select a `Skill Level`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then
  the progress bar automatically displays the pre-defined progress for
  that specific skill level. Skill levels can be created and modified
  from the `Skill Types <employees/skill-types>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} dashboard.

Click the `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button if
there is only one skill to add, or click the
`Save & New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to save the
current entry and immediately add another skill.

At any point, a new line can be added by clicking the

  the number of roles assigned to an employee.
- `Default Role`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: using the drop-down

# Offboarding

When an employee leaves the company, it is important to have an
`offboarding plan
<employees/offboarding>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to ensure all
necessary steps are followed, such as returning equipment, revoking
access to business systems, filling out HR forms, having an exit
interview, and more. Depending on the company, there could be several
different offboarding plans, configured for specific departments or
divisions, that have different requirements and steps from the main
offboarding plan.

In addition to an offboarding plan, the employee record must be
`updated to reflect their
departure <employees/archive>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, log the
reason why they left, close any open activities associated with the
employee, and
`provide them with any important documents <employees/send-link>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

## View offboarding plan {#employees/offboarding}

Before offboarding can begin, it is recommended to check the default
offboarding plan that comes preconfigured with the **Employees** app. To
view the current default plan, navigate to
`Employees app --> Configuration --> Activity Plan`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click `Offboarding`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to view the detailed offboarding plan form.

### Offboarding plan steps

The default `Offboarding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} plan is
minimal, with two default steps (three if the **Fleet** app is
installed). All steps are `To-Do`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
activities, and are scheduled for the day the offboarding plan is
launched (`0 days Before Plan Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

- `Organize knowledge transfer inside the team`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: The manager must ensure all knowledge the employee
  has relating to their job position, is either documented or shared
  with colleagues so there is no knowledge gap.
- `Take Back Fleet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The fleet
  manager ensures any vehicles assigned to the employee are either
  unassigned (available for other employees) or the next driver is
  assigned. This step only appears if the **Fleet** app is installed.
- `Take Back HR Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The
  manager must obtain any documents and materials the HR department
  requires. It is recommended to check with the HR department to ensure
  everything required for this step is completed.

![The three default steps in the Offboarding plan.](offboarding/offboarding.png)

## Modify offboarding plan

The default offboarding plan is minimal, so that modifications can be
made to accommodate any company\'s offboarding needs. Every company has
different requirements, therefore it is necessary to add the required
steps to the offboarding plan.

If the offboarding plan is universal, add or modify the default
offboarding plan. If the offboarding plan needed is only for a specific
department, then a new plan should be created, specifically for that
department.

To modify the default plan, first navigate to
`Employees app --> Configuration -->
Activity Plan`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, then click on
`Offboarding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To modify a step, click on the step and an
`Open: Activities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears. Make any desired modifications to the step, then click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to accept the changes and
close the pop-up window.

To add a new step, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
at the bottom of the listed activities in the
`Activities To Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and a
blank `Create Activities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window appears. Enter all the information in the pop-up window, then
click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if there are no
other steps to add, or click `Save & New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} if more steps are needed.

Configure all the desired steps for the offboarding plan.

## Create offboarding plan

For some companies, specific offboarding plans may be necessary for some
departments. For these cases, a new department-specific offboarding plan
may be needed.

To create a new offboarding plan, first navigate to `Employees app -->
Configuration --> Activity Plan`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the upper-left corner, and a blank plan form
loads.

Enter the following information on the form:

- `Plan Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the specific name for
  the plan.
- `Model`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field specifies where
  this plan can be used. In this case, in the **Employees** app. This
  field is not able to be modified.
- `Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if left blank (the
  default setting) the plan is available for all departments. To make
  the plan department-specific, select a department using the drop-down
  menu.

Next, add the various steps for the plan by clicking
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the bottom of the
listed activities in the `Activities To Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and a blank `Create
Activities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears.

Enter the following information in the pop-up window:

- `Activity Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  drop-down menu, select the specific activity to be scheduled. The
  default options are `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Call`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Meeting`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `To-Do`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Upload Document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If the **Sign**

A company specializing in after-school art programs has two separate
offboarding plans, one for the teachers working in the field, and one
for office workers.

The offboarding plan for the teachers is set for the
`Art Program Teachers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} department,
and includes specialized tasks relating to those jobs. These include
ensuring all art supplies are catalogued and returned, all student
feedback forms are turned in, and all access badges and keys for the
various locations are returned.

:::

## Launch offboarding plan

After an employee has given notice (typically two weeks) or once the
company has decided to terminate the working relationship with the
employee, the offboarding plan should be launched. Navigate to the
`Employees app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and click on the
departing employee profile. Click the `Launch Plan`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, and a blank `Launch Plan`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window loads.

![The Launch Plan button on the employee profile.](offboarding/launch-plan-button.png)

Using the drop-down menu, select the desired offboarding plan in the
`Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Then, using the
calendar selector, set a date in the `Plan Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. This is typically the day the employee gave
notice, but any date can be selected.

The right-side of the `Launch Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window displays all the steps in the selected plan, grouped by
what was selected in the `Assignment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
fields for the various plan steps.

Once the `Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Plan Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields are configured,
click the `Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and Odoo
schedules everything in the plan, according to their respective due
dates. All scheduled activities appear in the chatter of the employee
profile.

## Archive an employee {#employees/archive}

In Odoo, when an employee leaves the company they must be *archived*.
This step should be done *after* the employee has been fully offboarded.
To archive an employee, first navigate to the
`Employees app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. From here,
locate the employee who is leaving the company, and click on their
employee card.

The employee form loads, displaying all their information. Click the
`fa-gear`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(gear)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon in the top-left corner, and a drop-down menu
appears. Click `oi-archive`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Archive`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and an
`Employee Termination`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears.

Fill out the following fields on the form:

- `Departure Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select a reason
  the employee is leaving from the drop-down menu. The default options
  are:
  - `Fired`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this option when
    an employee is being let go, and the company has given notice.
  - `Resigned`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this option
    when the employee no longer wishes to be employed, and the employee
    has given notice.
  - `Resigned: Retired`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this
    option when the employee is retiring.
  - `Became Freelance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this
    option when the employee is no longer working for the company, but
    is becoming a freelance worker instead.
  - `Mutual Agreement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this
    option when both parties have agreed to terminate their working
    relationship.
- `Contract End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  calendar selector, select the last day the employee is working for the
  company.
- `Detailed Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a short
  description for the employee\'s departure in this field.
- `Close Activities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick the
  checkbox next to each type of activity to close or delete any open
  activities associated with it. It is recommended to tick **all**
  checkboxes that are applicable. The available options are:
  - `Appraisals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: cancels all
    appraisals scheduled after the contract end date.
  - `Contract`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: applies an end date
    for the current contract.
  - `Company Car`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: removes the
    employee as the driver for their current company car, and
    `assigns the next driver <fleet/new_vehicle/new-driver>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, if applicable.
  - `Equipment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: unassigns the
    employee from any assigned equipment.
- `HR Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick the checkbox next
  to `Send Access Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to send a
  download link to the employee\'s personal email address, containing
  all their personal HR files.
- `Private Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field appears
  if the `HR Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox is
  ticked. If there is a private email listed on the employee profile,
  this field is automatically populated. If no private email address is
  on their record, enter the private email address for the employee.

When the form is complete, click `Apply`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The employee record is archived, an email with a
download link to their personal documents is sent to the employee\'s
private email address (if selected), and a red
`Archived`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner appears in the
top-right corner of the employee form. The chatter logs the
`Departure Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Departure Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and if an access
link was emailed.

![The employee termination form with all fields filled out.](offboarding/termination.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

While attempting to send the HR documents access link, an
`Invalid Operation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window may
appear, displaying the following error message:

`Employee's related user and private email must be set to use "Send Access Link"
function: (Employee Name)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

If this error appears, click `Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to close the pop-up window, then tick the
`Send Access Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox to
deselect it on the `Employee Termination`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

Click `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to archive the employee
and close the selected activities on the
`Employee Termination`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window,
returning to the employee form.

Once the employee form, ensure the following fields are populated:

- `Private Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab: Ensure
  an email address is entered in the `Email`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field.
- `HR Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab: Ensure a
  `Related User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected in the
  corresponding field.

After the necessary information is entered,
`resend the HR documents access link
<employees/send-link>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
::::

### Send HR documents access link {#employees/send-link}

If the access link was not sent when first archiving the employee on the
*Employee Termination* form, it can be sent after the employee is
archived at any point.

After an employee is archived, they are no longer visible on the main
**Employees** app dashboard. To view the archived employees, navigate to
the `Employees app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} dashboard,
and click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the search bar to
reveal a drop-down menu. Select `Archived`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, towards the bottom of the
`fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Filters`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column, then click away from the drop-down window to
close it.

Now, only archived employees appear on the dashboard. Click on the
desired employee to open their employee form. On this form, click the
`fa-gear`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(gear)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon in the top-left corner, then click
`Send HR Documents Access Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from
the resulting drop-down menu. The chatter logs that the link was sent.

# Onboarding

When a new employee is hired, it is important to have an onboarding
procedure that can be followed. This ensures that information,
equipment, and training are provided to the employee and any other
necessary steps for the business are assigned to the correct
individuals.

Proper onboarding ensures that new employees are given all the
information and tools needed to be successful in their roles and have a
smooth transition to their new job.

## View onboarding plan

Before onboarding can begin, it is recommended to check the default
onboarding plan that comes preconfigured with the **Employees** app. To
view the current default plan, navigate to
`Employees app --> Configuration --> Activity Plan`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click `Onboarding`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to view the detailed onboarding plan form.

::: {#onboarding/plan-form}
The plan form displays the following information:
:::

- `Plan Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the specific name for
  the onboarding plan.
- `Model`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: specifies where this plan
  can be used. In this case, in the **Employees** app.
- `Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if left blank (the
  default setting) this plan is available for all departments. Limit the
  use of the plan to a specific department by selecting the department
  using the drop-down menu.
- `Activities To Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this tab
  lists all the onboarding steps. Each row displays:
  - `Activity Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the specific
    activity for the step. The default options are
    `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Call`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, `Meeting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `To-Do`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
    `Upload Document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If the
    **Sign** app is installed, a `Request Signature`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} option is available.

  - `Summary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a one line description
    of the step.

  - `Assignment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: chooses who
    completes the activity, relative to the new hire:

    - `Ask at launch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: choose the
      user in the `Assigned To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
      when
      `launching the onboarding plan <employees/launch-plan>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"}.
    - `Default user`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: choose a user
      who always handles this activity. Defined in the
      `Assigned to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
    - `Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: assigns the
      employee\'s manager as defined on the employee record.
    - `Coach`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: assigns the
      employee\'s coach as defined on the employee record.
    - `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the new hire
      completes the activity.
    - `Fleet Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: assigns the
      designated **Fleet** app manager. This option is only available if
      the **Fleet** app is installed.

  - `Assigned to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field remains
    blank, unless `Default user`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
    selected for the `Assignment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    field. If `Default user`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
    selected, this field is populated with the selected user.

  - `Document to sign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the
    corresponding document requiring a signature.

  - `Interval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the time when the
    activity is active.

  - `Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the set time interval,
    either `days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `weeks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
    `months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  - `Trigger`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: how scheduling is
    determined for the activity. Options are either
    `Before Plan Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `After Plan Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

    ::: example
    A laptop must be set up and registered to a new employee the day
    before they start work. The person who performs this step should
    always be the IT Manager, Abby Jones.

    To configure this activity with these parameters, the
    `Activity Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
    `To-Do`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, with a summary of
    `Assign Laptop`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
    `Assignment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set to
    `Default user`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
    `Assigned to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set to
    `Abby Jones`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
    `Interval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
    `1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
    `Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
    `days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
    `Trigger`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
    `Before Plan Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

    ![An activity configured to assign a laoptop the day before an employee starts work.](onboarding/activity-plan.png)
    :::

### Onboarding plan steps

The default `Onboarding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} plan
includes three default steps. All steps are `To-Do`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} activities, and are scheduled for the day the
onboarding plan is launched (`0 days Before Plan Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}).

- `Setup IT Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the manager
  must gather and configure all IT materials.
- `Plan Training`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the manager must
  plan the training for the new employee.
- `Training`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the new employee must
  complete the training planned by the manager.

![The three default steps in the Onboarding plan.](onboarding/onboarding.png)

## Modify onboarding plan {#employees/modify-plan}

A single onboarding plan works only if the flow works for the entire
company.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the onboarding plan is universal, add to or modify the default
onboarding plan. If department-specific onboarding plans are needed,
`create a new onboarding plan
<employees/create-plan>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

To modify the default plan, first navigate to
`Employees app --> Configuration -->
Activity Plan`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, then click on
`Onboarding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To modify a step, click on it. In the
`Open: Activities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window,
make any desired modifications to the step, then click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To add a new step, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
at the bottom of the listed activities in the
`Activities To Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and a
blank `Create Activities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window appears. Enter all the information in the pop-up window, then
click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if there are no
other steps to add, or click `Save & New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} if more steps are needed.

## Create onboarding plan {#employees/create-plan}

Some companies require different onboarding plans, when there are
department-specific onboarding procedures that do not apply to the whole
company. For these cases, a new department-specific onboarding plan must
be created.

To create a new onboarding plan,
`navigate to the desired plan and configure all the desired
steps <employees/modify-plan>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

::: example
A company specializing in the manufacturing and selling of outdoor metal
furniture may have a large factory that produces the products, and a
separate sales office. This company may have two separate onboarding
plans, one for factory workers, and one for office workers.

The onboarding plan for the factory workers is set for the
`Manufacturing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} department, and
includes specialized tasks relating to factory jobs. These include
gathering the new employees uniform and safety gear, assigning a safety
course, emailing their team about the new hire, going over benefits, and
more.

![An onboarding plan configured for factory workers.](onboarding/factory-onboarding.png)
:::

## Launch onboarding plan {#employees/launch-plan}

After an employee has been hired and their employee profile `is created
<recruitment/new-employee>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, navigate to
the desired employee\'s profile by clicking on their Kanban card on the
**Employees** app dashboard, then click the
`Launch Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on their
employee profile, and a blank `Launch Plan`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window loads.

In the `Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, choose the
desired onboarding plan. Then, using the calendar selector, set a date
in the `Plan Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. This is
typically the employee\'s first day, but any date can be selected.

The right side of the `Launch Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window displays all the steps in the selected plan, grouped by
what was selected in the `Assignment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
fields on the `plan form
<onboarding/plan-form>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Once the `Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Plan Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields are configured,
click the `Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and Odoo
schedules everything in the plan, according to their respective due
dates.

All scheduled activities appear in the both chatter of the employee
profile, and in the chatter of the user\'s with assignments relating to
the plan.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If any activity assignments were configured to
`Ask at launch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, an `Assigned
to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears on the
`Launch Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window. Using
the drop-down menu, select the user responsible for all the unassigned
activities.

# Employee retention report

It is possible to determine the retention rate for a company by
modifying an existing report.

First, navigate to
`Employees app --> Reporting --> Contracts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to open the `Employee Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} report. This report shows the number of all employees
for the `Last 365 Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, in a default
`fa-line-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Line Chart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The default Employees Analysis report.](retention_report/employees-analysis.png){.align-center}

Next, click the `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} button in the upper-left
corner, revealing a drop-down menu. Click
`# Departure Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the list,
then click away from the drop-down menu to close it. Now, the report
shows all the employees who were archived for the
`Last 365 Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To view this information in an easier format, click the
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the upper-right
corner, and the data is presented in a pivot table.

The various employees, organized by department, populate the rows. The
columns display the following totals: the monthly
`Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Fuel Card`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} budget, total `Annual
Employee Budget`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (also referred to as
the *annual salary*), the number of `New Employees`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, as well as the number of
`Departure Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (employees who
left).

![The Employees Analysis report, modified to show departed employees only.](retention_report/pivot-departures.png){.align-center}

## Employee retention rate comparison report

It is possible to compare data only for employees who left, compared to
the total current employees, between two separate time periods. This is
commonly referred to as the *employee retention rate*.

To view these metrics, first open the
`Employee Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report by
navigating to
`Employees app --> Reporting --> Contracts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click the `oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
upper-right corner to view the information in a pivot table.

Next, click the `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} button in the upper-left
corner, revealing a drop-down menu. Click
`# New Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Annual Employee Budget`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Fuel Card`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the list, to deselect these
metrics and hide them in the table. Then, click
`Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the bottom of the list to
enable that metric.

Click away from the drop-down menu to close it. Now, the report shows
all the employees who left the company
(`# Departure Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), as well as
the total number of employees (`Count`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}), for the `Last 365 Days`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

To compare the data for the current year with the previous year, click
the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the search bar,
revealing multiple filter and grouping options. Click
`Last 365 Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Filters`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column, to turn off that filter. Then, click
`Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click the current year
(in this example, `2024`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) from the
resulting drop-down menu.

Once a selection is made beneath `Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, a
`fa-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Comparison`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column appears. Click
`Date: Previous
Year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the new column, then click
off of the drop-down menu to close it.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In Odoo, in order to access the `fa-adjust`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Comparison`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, a
specific time *other than* `Last 365 Days`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} **must** be selected. If not, the
`fa-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Comparison`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column is **not**
visible.
::::

Now, the pivot table displays the total number of employees who left the
company (`#
Departure Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), as well as the
total number of employees (`Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"})
in the columns. These are further divided by the two different years,
and also displays the `Variation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
between the two.

The rows display the departments, and lists each individual employee for
each department, in the rows.

For a more concise view of this report, click
`fa-minus-square-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} above the top row of the
departments and employees, to collapse the rows. Now, the table presents
the total number of employees who left the company for both years,
compared to the total number of employees for both years, including the
difference, in a percentage.

::: example
In this example, `3`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} employees out of
`83`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} left in 2023, and
`8`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} employees out of
`202`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} left in 2024. There was a
`166.67%`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} increase in the employees
who left in 2024 as compared to 2023. Additionally, there was a
`143.37%`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} increase in the total
number of employees in 2024 as compared to 2023.

![The report modified to show the difference between two years of employees who left.](retention_report/comparison-years.png){.align-center}
:::

To view more detailed rates for each department, click
`fa-plus-square`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the single row, revealing
a drop-down menu, and click `Department`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Click away from the drop-down to close it, and now the
pivot table displays the total number of employees who left
(`# Departure Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), the total
number of employees (`Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), and
the `Variation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (in a percentage) for
both 2023 and 2024, organized by department.

::: example
In this example, it can be determined that the
`Management`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} department had the best
retention rate in 2024 as compared to 2023, with a
`Variation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} rate of
`-100%`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Additionally, it can be
determined that the `Management / Research &
Development`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} department had the most
turnover, with a `Variation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of
`300%`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Employees

- `Presence Display`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select how the
  employee\'s availability status is calculated.

  - `Based on attendances`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: marked
    available when
    `checked into <attendances/check-in>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    the **Attendances** app.
  - `Based on user status in system`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    marked available when the `employee logs in to
    Odoo <attendances/check_in_check_out>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}.

- `Advanced Presence Control`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: when
  enabled, presence status can be calculated from operational signals
  rather than check-ins or logins:

  - `Based on number of emails sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    an employee is marked present if they send at least \# emails per
    hour; otherwise, they are marked absent. Enter the minimum number of
    emails that must be sent in the `Sent Emails`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field.
  - `Based on IP Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: an
    employee is marked present only when connected from one of the
    specified corporate IP addresses. Enter the IP addresses in the
    `IP Addresses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, separating
    each address with a comma.

- `Skills Management`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enable this
  option to display the
  `resumé tab <employees/resume>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} on
  employee profiles. This allows for the display of

- `Remote Work`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enable this option
  to allow for a detailed schedule to appear on the employee form, in
  the `Work Information <employees/work-info-tab>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} tab. When enabled, the specific location can be set for
  each working day for the employee. The corresponding icon is displayed
  in the upper-right corner of the employee card, indicating their
  location by icon, and status by color.

  ::: example
  A green `fa-home`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(home)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon indicates the
  employee is working from home that day. A
  `fa-building`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(building)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon means the
  employee is scheduled to work at the office.

  The *color* of the icon indicates the employee\'s status, with green
  indicating present, yellow indicating absent, and gray indicating it
  is outside of the employee\'s working hours.

# Accidents

When managing a fleet, accidents are inevitable. Tracking accidents is
crucial for understanding vehicle maintenance costs and identifying safe
drivers.

Odoo\'s **Fleet** app offers multiple ways of tracking accidents. Below
are step-by-step instructions for one possible method to monitor
accidents and repair costs.

## Structure

For this use case, go to
`Fleet app --> Fleet --> Services`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. On the `service
form <fleet/service-form>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, two
`service types <fleet/new-type>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are
created: [Accident - Driver\'s Fault]{.title-ref} and [Accident - No
Fault]{.title-ref}.

This setup records repairs associated with accidents and organizes them
by fault.

When an accident occurs, a service record is created. The specific
repairs needed for the accident are logged in the *Description* of the
service record, and the details about the accident are logged in the
*Notes* section.

With this organizational structure, it is possible to view all accidents
organized by fault, car, driver, or cost.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To manage accidents, the creation of service records is **required**.

Refer to the `service`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} documentation for
detailed instructions on creating service records in Odoo\'s **Fleet**
app.
::::

## Log accidents and repairs

To log an accident and initiate the repair process, the first step is to
`create a service
record <fleet/service-form>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} detailing the
specific repairs needed.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Some accidents require multiple repairs with several different vendors.
For these scenarios, a separate service record is needed for each vendor
performing repairs. To keep records organized, it is recommended to keep
the *Notes* field identical, and attach the same important
documentation, such as a police report.
::::

Navigate to `Fleet app --> Fleet --> Services`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to view the main `Services`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard. Click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the top-left corner, and a blank service form loads.

Enter the following information on the form:

- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the
  description of repairs needed to fully repair the vehicle, such as
  [Bodywork]{.title-ref}, [Windshield Replacement]{.title-ref}, or
  [Replacement Bumper, Tires, and Windows]{.title-ref}.

- `Service Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: for this example,
  select either [Accident - Driver\'s Fault]{.title-ref} or [Accident -
  No Fault]{.title-ref}, depending on the situation.

  When entering either of these two `Service Types`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} for the first time, type in the new service type,
  then click `Create (new service type)`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. A `Create Service Type`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears, with the new service type
  populating the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. In the
  `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select
  `Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu,
  then click the `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  button.

  Once an accident service type has been added to the database, it is
  available to select from the drop-down menu in the
  `Service Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

- `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: using the calendar popover
  window, select the date the accident occurred. Navigate to the desired
  month using the `fa-chevron-left`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `fa-chevron-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icons, then click the
  date to select it.

- `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: leave this field blank, as
  the repair cost is not yet known.

- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the vendor
  performing the repairs using the drop-down menu. If the vendor has not
  already been entered in the system, type in the vendor name, and click
  either `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add them, or
  `Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
  `add and configure the
  vendor <fleet/new-vendor>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

- `Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the vehicle that
  was in the accident from the drop-down menu. When the vehicle is
  selected, the `Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
  populated, and the unit of measure for the
  `Odometer Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears.

- `Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the current driver listed
  for the selected vehicle populates this field when the
  `Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected. If a
  different driver was operating the vehicle when the accident occurred,
  select the correct driver from the drop-down menu.

- `Odometer Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the
  odometer reading when the accident occurred. The units of measure are
  either in kilometers (`km`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) or
  miles (`mi`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), depending on how the
  selected vehicle was configured.

- `NOTES`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the specific details
  of the accident at the bottom of the service form, such as [Hit a
  deer]{.title-ref} or [Rear-ended at an intersection while
  stopped]{.title-ref}.

Odoo provides the ability to attach any important paperwork, such as
repair estimates and police reports, to the service record. To do so,
click the `fa-paperclip`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(paperclip)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, located in the
*chatter* of the form, and a file explorer pop-up window appears.
Navigate to the desired record, and click `Open`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to upload the file.

> :::: note
> ::: title
> Note
> :::
>
> Once a file is added to a service record, a `Files`{.interpreted-text
> role="guilabel"} section appears in the *chatter*. To attach more

> `Attach files`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add more
> documents.
> ::::

![Enter the information for an accident repair.](accidents/service-form.png)

## Service stages

In Odoo\'s **Fleet** app, there are four default service stages:

::::::: tabs
::: tab
New

The default stage when a service record is created. The service has been
requested, but repairs have not begun. The `Cost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field for this stage remains zero.
:::

::: tab
Running

The repair is in-process, but not yet complete. The estimate for repairs
is listed in the `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
:::

::: tab
Completed

All repairs listed on the service form have been completed. The
`Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is updated to reflect
the final total cost charged for the repairs.
:::

::: tab
Cancelled

The service request has been cancelled.
:::
:::::::

During the repair process, change the service status to reflect the
vehicle\'s current state in one of two ways: on the individual
`service record <fleet/service_record>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
or in the `Kanban
service view <fleet/Kanban>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

### Service record {#fleet/service_record}

Open the main *Services* dashboard, by navigating to
`Fleet app --> Fleet -->
Services`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Next, click on the
individual service record to open the detailed service form. Click the
desired stage in the top-right corner, above the service form, to change
the status.

![The stages as seen from the service form.](accidents/running.png)

### Kanban view {#fleet/Kanban}

Open the main *Services* dashboard, by navigating to
`Fleet app --> Fleet -->
Services`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. First, click the
`oi-view-kanban`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Kanban`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the top-right of the
screen, which organizes all repairs by vehicle.

Next, remove the default `Service Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} filter in the search bar. Upon doing so, all services
appear in a Kanban view, organized by their respective
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Drag-and-drop the service record to the desired stage.

![The Kanban view of stages, with a card being dragged and dropped to the Running stage.](accidents/drag-n-drop.png)

## Accident reporting

One of the main reasons to track accidents using the method outlined in
this document is the ability to view the total accident cost, determine
the safest drivers, and calculate the actual total cost for specific
vehicles.

The main
`Services dashboard <fleet/services_dashboard>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} displays all the various accident information, while the
`Reporting dashboard <fleet/reporting_dashboard>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} displays the total cost for specific vehicles.

### Services dashboard {#fleet/services_dashboard}

Navigate to `Fleet app --> Fleet --> Services`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to view the `Services`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard. All service records are displayed in a
`oi-view-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(List)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} view, grouped alphabetically, by
`Service Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The two service types created for accident tracking appear in the list:
`Accident - Driver
Fault`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Accident - No Fault`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Each grouping displays the number of records within each type, and lists
the individual records beneath each grouping title.

::: example
In this example, there are three accidents where the driver was at
fault, and one accident that was not the driver\'s fault. This dashboard
also displays the estimated total `Cost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for all the accidents in each group.

An estimated [\$3,284.00]{.title-ref} dollars are costs from
driver-caused accident repairs. The no-fault accident has no cost
associated with it, since the repair has not been completed, and no
estimate exists yet.

![Accident services, with the total costs highlighted.](accidents/group-accidents.png)
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The total `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} calculates **all**
costs on the repair form, including estimated costs, as well as final
repair costs. This number may not be accurate, if there are any repairs
in the *Running* stage, and the final bill has not yet been calculated.
::::

### Reporting dashboard {#fleet/reporting_dashboard}

Navigate to `Fleet app --> Reporting --> Costs`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to view the `Cost
Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} report. This report
displays a `fa-bar-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Bar Chart)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of all
`Contract`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} costs for the current year,
organized by month (`Date : (year)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}),
by default. The `Sum`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, represented by
a gray dotted line, is the combined total of both the
`Contract`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} costs.

To view the total cost by vehicle, click the
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Toggle Search Bar)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon at the
right of the search bar, revealing a drop-down menu. Click
`Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`oi-group`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Group By`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column, and the data is organized by vehicle.

This displays the true cost for each vehicle, including both the
contract cost (such as the monthly vehicle lease cost) and all service
costs, including all accidents. Hover over a column to reveal a data
popover window, which displays the vehicle name and the total cost. This
allows for a more complete view of the vehicle cost.

![The Cost Analysis report, displaying total costs by vehicle.](accidents/total-costs.png)

To view the individual cost details for both contract costs and repairs,
click the `oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the top-right
corner of the `Cost
Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard. This displays
each vehicle on a separate line, and displays the
`Contract`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} cost and
`Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} cost, as well as the
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} cost.

![The Cost Analysis report, displaying the contract and service costs separately, as well as
the total.](accidents/fleet-pivot.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view organizes the data by
vehicle, by default, therefore grouping the data by
`Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is not required. If this
filer is already activated, it does not affect the presented data.
::::

## Manage accident repairs

For companies with multiple employees, who manage a large fleet of
vehicles, displaying only service records in the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Running`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stages
can be time-saving, if there are a large number of records in the
*Services* dashboard.

Navigate to `Fleet app --> Fleet --> Services`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, where all service requests are organized by
`Service Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Next, click the
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Toggle
Search Panel)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon at the right of
the search bar, revealing a drop-down menu. Click `Add
Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Filters`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column, and a `Add Custom
Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears.

Three drop-down fields need to be configured on the pop-up window.

In the first field, scroll down, and select `Stage`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Leave the second field set to `=`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Select `Running`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down
menu in the last field.

Next, click the `fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(plus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the right of the
last field, and an identical rule appears beneath the current rule.

Then, change `Running`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the third field of the
second rule, leaving the other fields as-is.

Click the `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the bottom
to add the new custom filter.

![The filter settings to be added to only display new and running services.](accidents/custom-filters.png)

This slight modification only presents services in the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `Running`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} stages. This is a helpful report for a company managing
a high number of repairs at any given time.

To have this report appear as the default report when opening the
`Services`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, click the
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Toggle Search Panel)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon at the
far-right of the search bar. Next, click
`Save current search`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, beneath the
`fa-star`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Favorites`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column, which reveals another drop-down column beneath
it. Tick the checkbox beside `Default Filter`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, then click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Then, this customized `Services`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
dashboard appears, by default, any time the `Services`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard is accessed.

# Cost analysis report

The **Fleet** app allows for analysis on
`total vehicle costs <fleet/total-costs>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
including both contract costs and service and repair charges. Data can
be adjusted to view total costs by
`vehicle <fleet/by-vehicle>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or
`driver <fleet/by-driver>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Additionally,
costs can be compared with the previous year, quarter, or month, to view
changes in fleet costs over time.

## Total costs {#fleet/total-costs}

To view the *Cost Analysis Report*, navigate to
`Fleet app --> Reporting --> Costs`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. The default report shows a bar chart of service
and contract costs for the current year, organized by month.

::: example
In this report, it is possible to determine that June had the highest
total costs, with almost \$14,000 dollars in contract and repair costs,
while January had the lowest costs, with less than \$2,000 of contract
costs and no repairs.

![The default cost analysis report showing contract and service costs.](cost_analysis/cost-analysis.png)
:::

## Cost by vehicle {#fleet/by-vehicle}

Some companies want to view costs not by month, but by vehicle. This
allows fleet managers to determine which vehicles cost the most to keep
on the road, aiding in decision making for future purchases and repairs.

To view these metrics, open the default
`cost analysis report <fleet/total-costs>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Next, click into the search bar, and click
`Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under the
`oi-group`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Group By`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column.

::: example
From this report, it can be determined the [Toyota Corolla]{.title-ref}
with the license plate [STU-1718]{.title-ref} cost the most, with almost
\$14,000 in costs for the year. Additionally, the both [Nissan
Micro]{.title-ref} vehicles and the [Ford Focus]{.title-ref} cost the
least, with under \$5,000 in total costs each.

![The cost analysis report showing annual costs by vehicle.](cost_analysis/by-vehicle.png)
:::

## Cost by driver {#fleet/by-driver}

Another useful metric is to determine which drivers incur the most
repair costs, allowing fleet managers to determine which vehicles to
assign which drivers. To view this configuration, open the default
`cost analysis report <fleet/total-costs>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Next, click into the search bar, and click
`Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under the
`oi-group`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Group By`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column. Finally, click the
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon.

The report now shows the totals for both `Contract`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} costs
for each driver in the database. This allows fleet managers to see which
drivers incur the most repair costs.

::: example
This report shows that [Sandra Elvis]{.title-ref} had no service costs
for the year, while both [Doris Cole]{.title-ref} and [David
Armstrong]{.title-ref} had almost \$9,000 in repairs. While this does
not explain why those two drivers incurred the most costs, it is
possible for the fleet manager to `investigate the
service records <fleet/view-services>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for
those two drivers, to determine why there were such high costs for the
year.

![The cost analysis report showing costs by driver in a pivot table.](cost_analysis/by-driver.png)
:::

## Detailed comparison

All reports in the **Fleet** app are able to compare costs from previous
time periods, either year, quarter, or month. To view a detailed cost
comparison between the third and fourth quarter, open the default
`cost analysis report <fleet/total-costs>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, then click the `oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon. Next,
click into the search bar and click `Q4`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, then
`Date: Previous Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`fa-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Comparison`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

The report now shows detailed contract and service costs for each
vehicle, with a `Variation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column,
showing increases or decreases in costs from the third and fourth
quarter of the current year.

::: example
In this example, it can be determined that the [Ford Focus]{.title-ref}
had the greatest change in terms of lowered total costs, with a 75.25%
reduction in costs. Additionally, the [Nissan Micro]{.title-ref} with
the license plate of [DEF-456]{.title-ref} was the only vehicle with an
overall increase in total costs, with an increase of 41.78%.

# Models & manufacturers

Odoo\'s **Fleet** app categorizes each vehicle by *manufacturer* and
*model* (e.g. [BMW]{.title-ref}, [X2]{.title-ref}). Before a vehicle can
be added to the Odoo database, its
`manufacturer <fleet/manufacturers>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`model <fleet/add-model>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} record must
already exist in the database.

## Manufacturers {#fleet/manufacturers}

Odoo\'s **Fleet** app comes preconfigured with sixty-seven commonly used
car and bicycle manufacturers in the database, along with their logos.
To view the pre-loaded manufacturers, go to
`Fleet app --> Configuration --> Manufacturers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and the `Manufacturers`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard loads.

The default filter, `With Models`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
displays only manufacturers that already have vehicle models. Remove the
default filter to view *all* manufacturers.

Manufacturers are listed alphabetically, and each card shows how many
specific `models
<fleet/models>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are configured for each
particular manufacturer.

![Manufacturer card with the amount of models listed.](models/manufacturer.png)

### Add a manufacturer {#fleet/add-manufacturers}

To add a new manufacturer to the database, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the upper-left corner of the
`Manufacturers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, and a
blank manufacturers form loads. Type the name of the manufacturer in the
`Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and select an image to
upload for the `Logo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Models {#fleet/models}

When adding a vehicle to the fleet, specify the vehicle model to
maintain updated records, which keeps track of specific details, like
vehicle capacity and parts compatibility.

Unlike `manufacturers <fleet/manufacturers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, models do **not** come preconfigured in the **Fleet** app.
When a new vehicle model joins the fleet, the model (and, if necessary,
the manufacturer) **must** be
`added to the database <fleet/add-model>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

### Add a model {#fleet/add-model}

To add a new vehicle model, navigate to
`Fleet app --> Configuration --> Models`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
the upper-left corner, and enter the following information on the new
model form.

:::: note

### Information tab

In the `Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, specify
details about the car model, such as the car size, passenger capacity,
and engine information.

#### Model

- `Model Year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the year the
  vehicle was manufactured.
- `Seating Capacity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter how many
  passengers the vehicle can accommodate.
- `Number of Doors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the number
  of doors the vehicle has.

  vehicle.
- `Trailer Hitch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick this checkbox
  if the vehicle has a trailer hitch installed.

#### Salary

The `Salary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section **only** appears
if the company has their localization setting set to Belgium. The cost
values are all *monthly*, with the exception of the `Catalog Value (VAT
Incl.)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Can be requested`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enable this
  checkbox if employees can request this model vehicle, if a vehicle is
  part of their employee contract.

- `Catalog Value (VAT Incl.)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter
  the `MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail
  Price)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the vehicle at the time of
  purchase or lease.

- `C02 fee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Represents the carbon
  dioxide emission fee paid to the Belgian government. This value is
  automatically calculated, based on Belgian laws and regulations, and
  **cannot** be modified. The value is based on the figure entered in
  the `CO2 Emissions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field (in the
  `Engine`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
  `Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab) on the vehicle
  form.

  Modifying the `CO2 Emissions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
  adjusts the value in the `CO2 fee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  field.
  ::::

- `Cost (Depreciated)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  monthly vehicle cost, which appears in the salary configurator for
  future employees. This value impacts the gross and net salary of the
  employee assigned to the vehicle. This figure is depreciated over
  time, according to local tax laws. The
  `Cost (Depreciated)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} does **not**
  depreciate automatically on the *vehicle model*, it only depreciates
  based on the *contract* linked to a specific vehicle.

- `Total Cost (Depreciated)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This
  value is the combination of the `Cost
  (Depreciated)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
  `C02 fee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields. It also
  depreciated over time.

#### Engine

- `Fuel Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the type of fuel the vehicle uses. The default options
  are `Diesel`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Gasoline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Full Hybrid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  `Plug-in Hybrid Diesel`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Plug-in Hybrid Gasoline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},

  role="guilabel"}, `Hydrogen`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Electric`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Range`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the distance the
  vehicle can travel on one tank of gas, or one battery charge, in miles
  (`mi`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) or kilometers
  (`km`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}). To change the unit of
  distance, click the drop-down next to the `km`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} or `mi`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and
  select the desired unit of distance.

  carbon dioxide emissions the vehicle produces in grams per kilometer
  (`g/km`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) or miles
  (`g/mi`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}). This information is
  provided by the car manufacturer.
- `Emission Standard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  regulatory test procedure or guideline used to determine the
  `CO2 Emissions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, such as the
  `EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  or Euro 6.
- `Transmission`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the type of transmission, either
  `Manual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Automatic`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Power Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select how the vehicle\'s power is measured, either in kilowatts
  or horsepower.
- `Power`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the vehicle is electric
  or hybrid, enter the power the vehicle uses in kilowatts
  (`kW`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}). This field only appears if
  `kW`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected for the
  `Power`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
- `Horsepower`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the vehicle\'s
  horsepower (hp) in this field. This field only appears if

  `Power`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
- `Horsepower Taxation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  amount of taxes incurred according to the engine specifications. The
  number is dependent on the local tax laws, therefore it is recommended
  to check with the accounting department to ensure the correct taxation
  amount is entered. This field only appears if the
  `Power`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set to
  `Horsepower`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (which changes the
  `Power`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
  `Range`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) .
- `Tax Deduction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The percentage
  that can be deducted from taxes is populated based on the
  localization, and **cannot** be modified. This field only appears for
  certain localizations.

### Vendors tab

Specify the vendors a vehicle can be purchased from in this tab. With
proper setup, `requests
for quotations <../../inventory_and_mrp/purchase/manage_deals/rfq>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for vehicles can be created through Odoo\'s **Purchase**
app.

To add a vendor, click the `Add Vendors`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} block in the `Vendors`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. This opens an `Add: Vendors`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window, with a list of all the vendors currently
in the database. Add any preexisting vendors by clicking the checkbox
next to the vendor name, then click `Select`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. No limitations exist on the number of vendors that can
be added to this list.

If a vendor is *not* already in the database, add a new vendor by
clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the bottom-left of
the `Add: Vendors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window. In
the `Create Vendors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form that
appears,
`enter the necessary information <../../essentials/contacts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, then click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to add the vendor, or click
`Save & New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add the current
vendor and create another new vendor.

## Model category {#fleet/categories}

To aid with fleet organization, it is recommended to have vehicle models
housed under a specific category. Model categories are set on the
`vehicle model form <fleet/add-model>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Odoo does **not** come with any categories preconfigured; all categories
**must** be added.

To view any categories currently set up in the database, navigate to
`Fleet app -->
Configuration --> Categories`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
All categories are displayed in a list view.

### Add a new model category {#fleet/new-category}

To add a new category, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the top-left corner of the
`Categories`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard. A new entry
line appears at the bottom of the list. Type in the new category, then
either click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or click
anywhere on the screen, to save the entry.

To reorganize how the categories appear in the list, click on the
`oi-draggable`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(draggable)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the left of any
desired category name, and drag the line to the desired position.

The order of the list does *not* affect the database in any way.
However, it may be preferable to view the vehicle categories in a
specific order, for example, by size, or the number of passengers the
vehicle can carry.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When used with the **Inventory** app, the `Max Weight`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Max Volume`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
fields track a vehicle\'s capacity. This helps manage in-house
deliveries by `showing how
much space and weight remain for loading products
<../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/dispatch>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

# Adding vehicles

Odoo\'s **Fleet** app manages all vehicles, and the accompanying
documentation that comes with vehicle maintenance and driver records.

Upon opening the `Fleet`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
application, all vehicles are organized within the
`Vehicles`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, which is the
default dashboard. Each vehicle is displayed in its corresponding Kanban
stage, based on its status. The default stages are
`New Request`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`To Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Registered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Downgraded`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Settings {#fleet/settings}

Before registering any vehicles, review two **Fleet** settings that
directly affect day-to-day operations and employee benefits:

- `End Date Contract Alert <fleet/end-contract>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: Emails the contract\'s *Responsible* person a set number
  of days before the vehicle agreement expires, so renewals or returns
  are not missed.
- `New Vehicle Request <fleet/request>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:
  (Only for the `Belgian payroll localization
  <../payroll/payroll_localizations/belgium>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}) Blocks employees from requesting a new company car
  through the salary configurator, once the available vehicles already
  exceed the defined limit, helping control benefits costs.

To access the settings menu, go to
`Fleet app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

### End Date Contract Alert {#fleet/end-contract}

The `End Date Contract Alert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
shows how many days before the end of a vehicle contract an alert should
be sent. The `responsible parties <fleet/responsible>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} receive an email informing them that a vehicle contract is
about to expire in the number of days defined in this field.

![Settings available for the Fleet application.](new_vehicle/fleet-settings.png)

#### Responsible parties {#fleet/responsible}

To determine the responsible person for a contract, open an individual
contract. The person listed as `Responsible`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} under the `Contract Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section of the contract receives the alert.

To open a contract from a list of all contracts, navigate to
`Fleet app --> Fleet -->
Contracts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and all contracts
appear in the list. Click on a `Contract`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to open it. In the `Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section of the contract, look under
`Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to see who receives
expiration alerts.

An individual contract can also be opened from a specific vehicle by
navigating to `Fleet app --> Fleet --> Fleet`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and clicking on an individual vehicle. On the
vehicle form, click the `fa-book`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Contracts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the top
of the page. Only contracts associated with the vehicle appear in the
list. Click on an individual contract to open it. The
`Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} person is listed on the
contract.

### New vehicle request {#fleet/request}

Enter the maximum fleet size that may be reached through the
salary-configurator flow. When the total number of available vehicles
(vehicles without an assigned driver) is equal to or below this limit,
employees can request a new company car. Once the available vehicles
exceed the limit, the request option is hidden.

::: example
If the `New Vehicle Request`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} limit is
set to 20 vehicles, and there are 25 vehicles available, employees
cannot request a new car and must select from the 25 already available.
If there are only 10 cars available, then the employee would be able to
request a new vehicle.
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This settings option **only** appears if the
`Belgian-Payroll-Fleet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} module is
installed for the Belgian localization.
::::

## Add a vehicle

To add a new vehicle to the fleet from the `Vehicles`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the top-left corner, and a blank vehicle form
loads. Then, proceed to enter the vehicle information on the vehicle
form.

## Vehicle form fields {#fleet/new_vehicle/vehicle-form}

- `Model`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down menu,
  select the vehicle\'s model. Once a model is selected, additional
  fields may appear on the form. If the model is not listed, type in the
  model name, and click either `Create "model"`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, or `Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to `create a new
  model and edit the model details <fleet/add-model>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- `License Plate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  vehicle\'s license plate number.
- `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select any tags from the
  drop-down menu, or type in a new tag. There is no limit on the amount
  of tags that can be selected.

![The new vehicle form, showing the model section.](new_vehicle/model.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Model`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is the *only* required
field on the new vehicle form. When a model is selected, other fields
appear on the vehicle form, and relevant information auto-populates the
fields that apply to the model. If some of the fields do not appear,
this may indicate there is no model selected.
::::

### Driver {#fleet/new_vehicle/new-driver}

This section of the vehicle form relates to the person who is currently
driving the car, as well as any plans for a change in the driver in the
future, and when.

- `Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down menu,
  select the driver for the vehicle. If the driver is not listed,
  `create the new driver and edit the driver details
  <fleet/new_vehicle/add-driver>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  A driver does *not* have to be an employee. When creating a new
  driver, the driver is added to the **Fleet** app and the **Contacts**
  app (if installed), *not* in the **Employees** app.
  ::::

- `Mobility Card`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the selected
  driver has a mobility card (such as a gas card) listed on their
  employee record in the **Employees** application, the mobility card
  number automatically appears in this field. If there is no mobility
  card listed, and one should be added, `edit
  the employee record <employees/hr-settings>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} in the **Employees** application.

- `Future Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the next driver
  for the vehicle is known, select the next driver from the drop-down
  menu. Or, type in the next driver and click either `Create "future
  driver"`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
  `create a new future driver, and edit the
  driver details <fleet/new_vehicle/add-driver>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  If this field is populated, an `Apply New Driver`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} button appears on the vehicle form. Click the
  `Apply New Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to change
  the driver information.
  ::::

- `Assignment Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  calendar selector, select when the vehicle is available for another
  driver. If this field is left blank, that indicates the vehicle is
  currently available, and can be assigned to another driver. If it is
  populated, the vehicle is not available for another driver until the
  selected date.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the company from
  the drop-down menu. This field only appears in a multi-company
  database.

#### Create a new driver {#fleet/new_vehicle/add-driver}

If a driver is not already in the system, the new driver should first be
configured and added to the database. A new driver can be added either
from the `Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Future Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields on the
`vehicle form <fleet/new_vehicle/vehicle-form>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

First, type in the name of the new driver in either the
`Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Future
Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, then click
`Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. A
`Create Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Create Future Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form appears,
depending on which field initiated the form.

Both the `Create Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Create Future Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} forms are
identical, and are stored in the **Contacts** app.
`Configure the new contact <../../essentials/contacts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, then click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Depending on the installed applications, different tabs or fields may be
visible on the `Create Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Create Future Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} forms.
::::

### Vehicle {#fleet/new_vehicle/general-info}

This section captures key physical details of a vehicle. Selecting an
existing `Model`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} may auto-fill some
fields.

Fill in the following fields on the form:

- `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the vehicle category from the available options. If the
  **Inventory** app is installed, the category affects any configured
  `dispatch
  management system
  <../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/dispatch>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.
- `Order Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the calendar
  selector, select the date the vehicle was ordered. Keeping track of
  how long vehicles have been in the fleet can help when making
  decisions on expensive repairs, or help decide when to surrender a
  vehicle.
- `Registration Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  calendar selector, select the date the vehicle was registered. Many
  regions require proper registration, so keeping track of registration
  dates is important.
- `Cancellation Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  calendar selector, select the date the vehicle lease expires, or when
  the vehicle is no longer part of the fleet (e.g., sold, plates
  surrendered).
- `Chassis Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the chassis
  number in the field. This is known in some countries as the
  `VIN (Vehicle Identification Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  number. Every vehicle has a unique number, so in the event of a theft
  or accident, a vehicle can be identified with this unique number.
- `Last Odometer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the last
  known odometer reading in the number field. Using the drop-down menu
  next to the number field, select whether the odometer reading is in
  kilometers `(km)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or miles
  `(mi)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Keeping track of a
  vehicle\'s mileage is crucial when determining the value of the
  vehicle for both tax purposes and resale value.
- `Fleet Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the fleet
  manager from the drop-down menu, or type in a new fleet manager, and
  click either `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Type in the specific
  location where the vehicle is typically located in this field. The
  entry should clearly explain where the vehicle can be found, such as
  [Main Garage]{.title-ref} or [Building 2 Parking Lot]{.title-ref}.
  This is crucial information for companies with many locations where
  vehicles are stored.
- `Make Vehicle Available`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Click the
  checkbox if the vehicle can be selected when an employee fills out the
  `salary configurator <recruitment/configure-package>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

![The new vehicle form, showing the vehicle tax section.](new_vehicle/new-vehicle-type.png)

### Tax Info tab

Depending on the localization setting for the database, and what
additional applications are installed, other fields may be present on
the form.

The sections below are default and appear for all vehicles, regardless
of other installed applications or localization settings.

#### Fiscality

- `Horsepower Taxation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  amount that is taxed based on the size of the vehicle\'s engine. This
  is determined by local taxes and regulations, and varies depending on
  the location. It is recommended to check with the accounting
  department to ensure this value is correct.
- `Deductibility Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Configure
  the dates and percentages of the vehicle-related costs (fuel,
  maintenance, depreciation, etc.) that can be deducted from the
  company\'s taxable income. The `Start Date`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field indicates *when* the deduction begins, and the
  `Deductibility (%)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field indicates
  the percentage to be deducted.

#### Contract

- `First Contract Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  start date for the vehicle\'s first contract using the calendar
  selector. Typically this is the day the vehicle is purchased or
  leased.
- `Catalog Value (VAT Incl.)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter
  the `MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail
  Price)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the vehicle at the time of
  purchase or lease.
- `Purchase Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  purchase price or the original value of the lease for the vehicle.
- `Residual Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the current
  value of the vehicle.

:::: note

![The new vehicle form, showing the vehicle tax section.](new_vehicle/new-vehicle-tax.png)

### Model tab

If the model for the new vehicle is already configured in the database,
the `Model`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Engine`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sections are populated with
the corresponding information. If the model is *not* already in the
database and the `Model`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab needs to
be configured, `configure the
new vehicle model <fleet/add-model>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Check the information in the `Model`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab to ensure it is accurate. For example, the color of the vehicle or
whether a trailer hitch is installed are examples of common information
that may need updating.

# Services

To properly maintain a fleet of vehicles, regular maintenance as well as
periodic repairs are needed. Scheduling repairs and managing services
for an entire fleet is necessary to ensure all vehicles are in good
working order when they are needed.

Services, such as regular maintenance, like oil changes or tire
rotations, can be logged in advance. Other repairs are logged as they
occur.

## Create service records {#fleet/service-form}

To log a service for a vehicle, go to the main
`Services`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard by navigating to
`Fleet app --> Fleet --> Services`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Open a new service form by clicking the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the top-left corner.

Fill out the information on the form. The only two fields that are
required to be populated are `Service Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The fields on the form are:

- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a brief
  description of the service in this field.

- `Service Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the type of service performed. If the desired service
  does not exist, enter a new type of service, and click either `Create
  "(service type)"`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
  `add the service type and configure it
  <fleet/new-type>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  Only one `Service Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} comes
  preconfigured in Odoo: `Vendor Bill`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
  ::::

- `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the calendar
  selector, select the date the service was provided, or is scheduled to
  be performed. Navigate to the desired month using the
  `oi-chevron-left`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `oi-chevron-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icons, then click on the
  date to select it.

- `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the estimated cost of
  the service, if available. If the service is for a future repair, this
  field should be left blank. This field is updated as estimates are
  received, and again, when the final repair cost is known.

- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down menu,
  select the vendor who is performing the service. If the vendor has not
  already been entered in the system, `add and configure the vendor
  <fleet/new-vendor>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

- `Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the vehicle that was serviced. When the vehicle is
  selected, the `Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
  populated, and the unit of measure for the
  `Odometer Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears.

- `Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The vehicle\'s current
  driver automatically populates this field when the
  `Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected. If the
  driver needs to be changed, another driver can be selected using the
  drop-down menu.

- `Odometer Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  odometer reading from when the service was done. The units of measure
  are either in kilometers (`km`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) or
  miles (`mi`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), depending on how the
  selected vehicle was configured.

  :::: tip

  To change from kilometers to miles, or vice versa, click the
  `oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(Internal Link)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the right
  of the vehicle selected in the `Vehicle`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field.

  Change the unit of measure, then navigate back to the service form,
  via the breadcrumb links. The unit of measure is then updated in the
  `Odometer Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
  ::::

- `NOTES`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter any notes for the
  repair at the bottom of the service form. For example, this can
  include estimate details or parts being replaced.

![Enter the information for a new service. The required fields are Service Type and Vehicle.](service/new-service.png)

### Create service type {#fleet/new-type}

The **only** method to create service types is from a
`service form <fleet/service-form>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

On the `service form <fleet/service-form>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, type in the name of the new `Service
Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the corresponding field.
Then, click `Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
a `Create Service Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up form
appears.

The service type entered on the service form automatically populates the
`Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, which can be modified,
if desired.

Then, select the `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
new service type from the drop-down menu in that field. The two default
options to choose from are `Contract`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
or `Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Additional categories
**cannot** be created.

If the service applies to **only** contracts or services, select the
corresponding `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If the
service applies to **both** contracts *and* services, leave this field
blank.

When done, click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Create vendor {#fleet/new-vendor}

When a service is performed for the first time, typically, the vendor\'s
record has not yet been added to the database. It is best practice to
add the full details for a vendor in the database, so that any necessary
information can be retrieved.

Vendors are added with the **Contacts** app. Refer to the `documentation
<../../essentials/contacts>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} for more
details.

:::: note

Different tabs or fields may be visible on the
`Create Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form, depending on
what other applications are installed.
::::

## View services {#fleet/view-services}

To view all services logged in the database, including old and new
requests, navigate to
`Fleet app --> Fleet --> Services`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. All services appear in a list view, including all
the details for each service.

The service records are grouped by
`service type <fleet/new-type>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. The
number of repairs for each service type appears in parentheses after the
name of the service type.

Each service listed displays the following information:

- `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date that the service,
  or repair, was performed (or requested to be performed).
- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a short description
  of the specific type of service, or repair, performed to clarify the
  specific service.
- `Service Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the type of
  service, or repair, performed. This is selected from a list of
  services that `must be configured <fleet/new-type>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- `Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the specific vehicle the
  service was performed on.
- `Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the current driver for
  the vehicle.
- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the specific vendor who
  performed the service, or repair.
- `Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: any information associated
  with the service, or repair, that is documented to add clarification.
- `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total cost of the
  service, or repair.
- `Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the status of the service,
  or repair. Options are `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Running`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Done`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, or `Cancelled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

At the bottom of the `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column,
the total cost of all services and repairs are listed.

# Visitors

In the Odoo **Frontdesk** application, a *visitor* refers to any
non-employee (e.g., repair person, job candidate, auditor, etc.).
Visitor arrivals and departures can be logged for security purposes,
ensuring an accurate record of who is on the premises.

## Visitor list {#frontdesk/list}

To access a complete list of checked-in visitors, navigate to
`Frontdesk app -->
Visitors`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

By default, the `Planned or Checked-In`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Today`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filters
appear in the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar.
::::

All visitors are presented in a list view, with the following details
that were entered upon check in:

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the guest\'s name.
- `Visitor Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the company the
  guest represents.
- `Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the guest\'s phone number.
- `Drinks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}\*: the drink the guest
  requested.
- `Host`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: who the guest is waiting to
  see.
- `CheckIn`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date and time the
  guest checked in.
- `Checkout`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}\*: the date and time the
  guest checked out. In the default view, only guests with a
  `Checked-In`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Planned`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status are visible.
  Guests with check-out times are only visible if the
  `Today`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter is removed.
- `Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the amount of time the
  guest has been checked in for.
- `Station`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the location of where
  the guest checked in.
- `Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the status of the guest.
  The options are `Checked-In`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Planned`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Checked-Out`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Cancelled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}\*: the guest\'s email
  address.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}\*: the company the guest
  is there to visit. This field is only available if in a multi-company
  database.

\* These fields are not visible in the default
`Visitor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list. These must be enabled
using the `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(adjust settings)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
top-right corner of the list.

To the far-right of the titled columns on the
`Visitors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, there is an untitled
column, where a guest\'s status can be updated.

When a guest leaves, click the available `Check out`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to update the guest\'s record, and log the date
and time they left.

If a scheduled guest arrives, and they did not check in using a
**Frontdesk** kiosk, they can be checked in from this list, by clicking
the available `Check in`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
log the date and time they arrived.

Beside the untitled status column, a `Drink Served`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button appears, but only if that particular visitor
requested a drink.

When their drink has been served, click the
`Drink Served`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to indicate the
drink has been delivered to the guest. Once clicked, that button
disappears.

On the far-right of the line, a `Print Badge`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button appears for *planned* visitors **only**. Click
this button to download a PDF file of the visitor\'s badge. The badge
displays the date and time the visitor checked in, the visitor\'s name
and company, who they are visiting, and the logo of the company they are
visiting.

:::: note
::: title
Note

The PDF badge can be printed onto adhesive labels for the visitor to
wear, or onto paper that can be placed into a plastic badge holder.
::::

![The full list of currently checked in visitors, with the drinks to be served highlighted.](visitors/visitors.png)

If any column is not visible, or if a visible column is preferred to be
hidden, click the `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(adjust settings)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, located at
the end of the top line. Doing so, reveals a drop-down menu of column
options to enable or disable. A `fa-check`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(check)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon indicates
the column is visible.

## Planned visitors {#frontdesk/planned}

When guests are expected, such as job candidates, government officials,
or new suppliers, it can be helpful to enter the visitor information in
advance. When the visitors arrive, they can utilize the *Quick Check In*
option on the kiosk, rather than entering all their information manually
upon arrival.

Enter expected guest information in advance by creating a planned guest
in the **Frontdesk** app.

To create a planned guest, navigate to
`Frontdesk app --> Visitors`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, enter the same
information as any other `visitor <frontdesk/list>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} on the guest form that appears. The only required fields are
the visitor\'s `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
`Station`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at which they are expected
to arrive.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If a guest is planned in advance, they must be checked in from the list
on the `Visitors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page in the
**Frontdesk** application (`Frontdesk app -->
Visitors`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}). If a planned guest
checks in using a kiosk, they are checked in separately from their
planned visitor entry, and their planned visitor entry remains listed as
`Planned`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The `Planned`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status of a planned
guest **only** changes to `Checked-In`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} when they are checked in *inside* the application\'s
`Visitors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list.

If a guest does check in using a kiosk, ensure all records are current,
and the list of guests that are currently on-site is correct. Be sure to
check in and/or check out the correct entries, so the visitors list
correctly reflects who is currently on the premises.

Ensure planned guests are informed that they should **not** check in
using the kiosk if they are listed as a planned guest in advance.
::::

## Visitor flow

### Visitor check in

When a visitor arrives at a facility, they approach a
`Frontdesk kiosk <frontdesk/kiosk>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
click `Check in`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The information
requested from the visitor is what was configured for that specific
**Frontdesk** station. If any information is required, the field
displays a red asterisk (\*). The visitor **must** enter the required
information in order to check in.

Once all the information is entered, the visitor taps the
`Check In`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

At any point in the check-in process, if ten seconds pass with no
selection, the kiosk returns to the main welcome screen.
::::

#### Planned visitor check in

When a `planned visitor <frontdesk/planned>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} arrives at a facility, they first approach a
`Frontdesk kiosk <frontdesk/kiosk>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. If
there are planned visitors for that day, a
`Quick Check In`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} panel appears on the
right-side of the kiosk, asking `Are you
one of these people?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} Beneath the
question is a list of all visitors schedule to arrive that day.

Click on the corresponding name in the list to check-in.

### Drinks

If drinks were configured for the station, after tapping
`Check In`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a registration
confirmation screen loads, along with the question:
`Do you want something to drink?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

The visitor can tap either `Yes, please`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `No, thank you`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If they select `Yes, please`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a drink
selection screen appears, and the preconfigured options are listed. The
visitor then taps the desired selection, or, if they do not want
anything, they can tap the `Nothing, thanks`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button at the bottom of the screen.

If a drink selection was made, a
`Thank you for registering! Your drink is on the way.`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} message appears.

### Notifications

Once the visitor has checked in, the person they are visiting, and any
other users who were configured to be notified when check-ins occur at
the kiosk, are notified. The notification is either by email, SMS
message, a *Discuss* chat, or any combination of those three options.

If the visitor requested a drink, the users configured as the
`People to Notify`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the drink form
are notified, via the *Discuss* application. The message that appears
is:
`(Visitor Name) just checked-in. They requested (Drink Name).`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}

Once the drink has been delivered to the guest, the person who delivered
the drink is responsible for marking the drink as delivered.

To mark a drink as delivered, navigate to
`Frontdesk app --> Stations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and choose the desired station card displaying
`(#) Drinks to serve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

This opens a list of all the visitors checked in at that station, and
are waiting for a drink. Click the `Drink Served`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button at the end of the line for the visitor who was
served. Once they are marked as having their drink served, the visitor
disappears from the list.

### Check out

Once the visitor has completed their business, and has left the
premises, it is important to check them out for accurate record keeping.

To check visitors out properly, navigate to
`Frontdesk app --> Stations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and choose the desired station card displaying
`(#) Drinks to serve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Doing so opens
a list of all the visitors who are currently checked-in at that station.

Click the `Check out`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button near the
end of the line for the visitor who left. Once they are marked as
checked-out, the visitor disappears from the list.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Visitors do **not** check themselves out when they leave. It is
important for **Frontdesk** users to check out visitors for accurate
record keeping.

Always have an accurate list of who is on the premises at any given
time. This is important for security purposes, and in the case of an
emergency.

# Frontdesk

The Odoo **Frontdesk** application provides a way for visitors to check
in to a building or location, and alert the person they are meeting
about their arrival. Additionally, they can request a preconfigured
beverage to be brought to them, while they wait.

This application is ideal for businesses that do **not** have someone
working at a reception desk, or locations **without** a designated
waiting area available to guests and visitors.

## Configuration

The first item to configure with the **Frontdesk** application is the
station, followed by any drink selections that might optionally be
offered.

### Stations {#frontdesk/stations}

In Odoo\'s **Frontdesk** application, a *Station* can be thought of as
any location where someone can sign in and wait for an employee. This is
typically some form of waiting room, such as a lobby. Each station has a
kiosk where visitors check in.

When setting up the **Frontdesk** application, a minimum of one station
**must** be configured, but there is no limit to how many stations can
be created and configured.

To create a station, navigate to
`Frontdesk app --> Configuration --> Stations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. When clicked, a blank frontdesk form appears.

Enter the following information on the form:

- `Frontdesk Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter a name for
  the specific frontdesk location. This should be short and
  identifiable, such as [Reception Desk]{.title-ref} or [Main
  Lobby]{.title-ref}. This field is required in order to create a
  station.

- `Responsibles`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the person
  (or persons) who are alerted when a visitor checks in using this
  specific frontdesk. Multiple selections can be entered. This field is
  required in order to create a station.

- `Kiosk URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field
  auto-populates once the frontdesk form is saved, with at least the
  `Frontdesk Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Responsibles`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields filled. To
  save manually, click the `fa-cloud-upload`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} `(Save manually)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon
  located at the top of the form.

  Once saved, a URL is generated in the `Kiosk URL`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field. This URL is one way the frontdesk kiosk is
  accessed.

  To access the kiosk, click the `Copy`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} button at the end of the URL, and navigate to that
  URL in a web browser. This URL opens that specific station\'s
  frontdesk sign-in page.

  :::: tip
  ::: title
  Tip
  :::

  To add an image/photo to a frontdesk form, hover over the
  `(camera with a '+' sign)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in
  the top-right of the form to reveal a `fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text
  role="icon"} `(Edit)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon.

  Click on the `fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(Edit)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to open a file
  explorer, navigate to the desired image/photo file, then click
  `Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to select it.

  The image selected for the station photo appears as the background
  image for the station kiosk.
  ::::

#### Options tab

::: {#frontdesk/host}
- `Host Selection`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the visitor is
  attending a meeting, this option allows the visitor to select the
  meeting host from a presented list, and notify that individual. When
  enabled, additional fields appear, as detailed below.
- `Authenticate Guest`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if additional
  information is required when a guest checks in, enable this option,
  and select which of the following are required:
  - `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select whether the
    guest\'s email address is `Required`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, `Optional`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
    if the information is not requested at all (`None`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}).
  - `Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select whether the
    guest\'s phone number is `Required`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, `Optional`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
    if the information is not requested at all (`None`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}).
  - `Organization`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select whether
    the guest\'s organization is `Required`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, `Optional`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
    if the information is not requested at all (`None`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}).
- `Theme`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the color mode of
  the kiosk. Choose either `Light`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Dark`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
  `Light`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} selection displays a pale
  gray background on the kiosk, whereas the `Dark`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} selection displays a dark gray and black background.
- `Self Check-In`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enable this option
  to present a check-in QR code on the kiosk. The QR code allows guests
  to check in using their mobile device, instead of using the kiosk.
  This option is recommended for a busy kiosk with multiple guests
  checking in at any time.
- `Offer Drinks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enable this option
  to offer guests a drink upon check in. If this option is enabled, it
  is necessary to
  `configure the drinks being offered <frontdesk/drinks>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, via the `Configure Drinks`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} link that appears when the option is enabled. Once
  all drink options are configured, select each drink to be offered
  using the drop-down menu.
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The following options are only visible in the
`Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab if the `Host Selection
<frontdesk/host>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} option is enabled.
::::

- `Notify by email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enable this
  option to have an email sent to the person the guest is visiting upon
  check in. When enabled, an `Email Template`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field appears beneath, with the default
  `Frontdesk Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  selected.

  To change the default email template, click the drop-down menu in the
  `Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, then select
  another email template.

  To modify the currently selected template, click the
  `oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Internal
  link)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon at the end of the line,
  and make any edits to the template.

- `Notify by SMS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enable this option
  to have an SMS (text) message sent to the person the guest is visiting
  upon check in. When enabled, an `SMS Template`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field appears beneath, with the default
  `Frontdesk SMS Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} selected.

  To change the default SMS template, click the drop-down menu in the
  `SMS Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and select
  another SMS template.

  To modify the currently selected template, click the
  `oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Internal
  link)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon at the end of the line,
  and make any desired edits to the content of the template. The SMS
  message may have a maximum of 242 characters, which fits in 4 SMS
  (UNICODE) messages.

- `Notify by Discuss`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this option is
  enabled by default when the `Host
  Selection`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is enabled. This
  option opens a **Discuss** application message window with the person
  the guest is visiting upon check in.

  When enabled, a default message appears for the person the guest is
  visiting. The **Discuss** application **must** be installed in order
  for this option to work.

:::: note

Note
:::

*Discuss* is installed by default when creating an Odoo database, and
does not count towards billing. As long as the *Discuss* application is
not intentionally uninstalled, the `Notify by Discuss`{.interpreted-text

::::

::: example
The default message format for the `Notify by Discuss`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option is: [(Frontdesk Station) Check-In: (Guest Name)

#### Side Message tab

Enter any desired text to appear on the station kiosk after a guest has
checked in, such as a welcome greeting or any necessary instructions.
The text appears on the confirmation page, on the right side of the
screen after a guest has completed the check-in process.

### Drinks {#frontdesk/drinks}

After a station is created, the next step is to configure the drinks to
offer visitors, if desired.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This step is **not** necessary or required for the **Frontdesk**
application to work, and only needs to be configured if drinks are
offered to guests.
::::

To add a drink option, navigate to
`Frontdesk app --> Configuration --> Drinks`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Doing so reveals a blank drink form to configure.

Enter the following information on the drink form:

- `Drink Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: type the name of the
  drink option in this field. This field is required.
- `People to Notify`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: use the
  drop-down menu in this field to select who is notified when the drink
  is selected. Multiple people can be entered in this field. This field
  is required.
- `Sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter a numerical value
  in this field to indicate where in the list of drink options this
  specific option appears. The lower the number, the higher on the list
  the drink appears. For example, entering the number one would place
  that drink at the top of the list, and appear first in the sequence.

## Kiosk setup {#frontdesk/kiosk}

Set up each kiosk for use after configuring the various stations. It is
recommended to use a dedicated device for each frontdesk kiosk, such as
a tablet.

Navigate to the kiosk in one of two ways:

- Navigate to the main **Frontdesk** application dashboard, and click
  the `Open Desk`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
  desired station card. The kiosk loads in a new browser tab.
- Navigate to
  `Frontdesk app --> Configuration --> Stations`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}, and click on the desired station. Then, click
  the `Copy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the end of the
  `Kiosk URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line, and paste the URL
  into a new browser tab or window.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Once a frontdesk kiosk is accessed, either with the
`Open Desk`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button or the
`Kiosk URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the user is
*automatically signed out of the database* on that specific device.

This is a security measure designed to prevent unauthorized access to
the database.
::::

## Reporting

The **Frontdesk** application has two reports available:
`Visitors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Drinks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To access either of these reports, navigate to
`Frontdesk app --> Reporting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} to
reveal a drop-down menu containing the options:
`Visitors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Drinks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The `Visitors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report displays the
number of visitors by month, for the current year. The
`Drinks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report shows how many total
requests were made for each drink.

As with all reports in Odoo, the filters and groups can be modified to
show other metrics, as well.

# Lunch management

In Odoo\'s **Lunch** application, it is required to have someone manage
the orders, vendors, and products. In addition, someone must be
responsible for the orders, and notifying employees when their orders
have arrived. This can be the same person.

Orders can be `cancelled <lunch/cancel>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`sent to the vendor <lunch/send-orders>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`confirmed <lunch/confirm-orders>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} upon
arrival, and `employees can be notified
<lunch/notify>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, either from the
`Today's Orders <lunch/todays-orders>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
dashboard, or the
`Control Vendors <lunch/control_vendors>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
dashboard.

To manage the **Lunch** app, users need the appropriate
`Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} rights. These can be
set by navigating to the `Settings app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and selecting `Manage Users`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, click on the desired user to view their access
rights.

For more information on access rights, refer to the `Access rights
<../../general/users/access_rights/>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Only users with administration rights are able to view the
`Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menus in the
**Lunch** application.
::::

## Today\'s Orders {#lunch/todays-orders}

To view and manage the orders for the day, navigate to
`Lunch app --> Manager -->
Today's Orders`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. All orders for
the day are presented in a list view on the `Today's
Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, with a filter for
`Today`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and grouped by
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, by default.

The following information appears in the list:

- `Order Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date the order
  was placed.
- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the vendor the product is
  being ordered from.
- `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the specific product
  ordered.
- `Extras`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: any extras selected for
  the product.
- `Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: any information needed to
  be sent to the vendor.
- `User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the user who ordered the
  product.
- `Lunch Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: where the product
  is set to be delivered.
- `Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total price for the
  product, including all extras.
- `Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the current status of the
  product.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the company under which
  the order was placed. This only appears in a multi-company database.

![The list that appears in the Today\'s Orders dashboard, with the filters and top column
names highlighted.](management/today.png)

### Cancel orders {#lunch/cancel}

All users can cancel an order, not only managers of the **Lunch** app.

To cancel an order from a vendor, individual products **must** be
cancelled one at a time.

On the `Today's Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, a
`fa-times`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Cancel`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button is shown at the far-right of each product line
that can be cancelled. Click the `fa-times`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Cancel`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
cancel the order for that individual product.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Only products with a red `Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tag
of `Ordered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be cancelled.
::::

![Order lines with the cancel button highlighted.](management/cancel.png)

### Send orders {#lunch/send-orders}

The first step in managing the **Lunch** app is to send the orders to
the vendors.

When orders are ready to be sent, the manager responsible for sending
orders **must** send the orders to the vendor, outside of the database
(call, online order, etc.).

Once orders have been placed with the vendors, click the
`Send Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button that appears
next to each vendor\'s name and phone number.

Once sent, the `Send Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
changes to a `Confirm Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button,
and the `Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column is updated
from red `Ordered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tags to blue
`Sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tags, indicating the order has
been sent to the vendor. Users who have placed orders in the **Lunch**
app rely on the `Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tags to
track their orders.

![A vendor\'s order with the X Cancel and Send Orders buttons highlighted.](management/send.png)

### Confirm orders {#lunch/confirm-orders}

After orders have been sent to the vendor, the next step is to confirm
the orders after they have been delivered.

On the `Today's Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard,
click the `Confirm Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
that appears next to the vendor\'s name and phone number.

Once confirmed, the `Confirm Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button disappears, and the `Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column is updated from blue `Sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tags to green `Received`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tags,
indicating the vendor has delivered the orders.

In addition, the `fa-times`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Cancel`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the end of each
product line changes to a `fa-envelope`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Send Notification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

If needed, instead of confirming all of the individual products from a
vendor, individual products can be confirmed one at a time. To confirm
an individual product, click the `fa-check`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the
end of the individual product line. When confirming individual products
with this method, the `Confirm Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button remains on the vendor line.

![The Today\'s Orders dashboard, with the two different ways to confirm an order highlighted.](management/confirm.png)

::: example
A vendor receives an order for three pizzas, and an order of garlic
knots. When the delivery is made to the company, the **Lunch** manager
notices the garlic knots are missing.

The manager first marks the three pizzas as received, by individually
confirming the products with the `fa-check`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the
end of each product line.

Later, when the vendor delivers the garlic knots, the manager can either
click the `fa-check`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the end of the
line for the garlic knots, or click the
`Confirm Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button that appears
next to the vendor\'s name and phone number.
:::

### Notify employees {#lunch/notify}

After products are received, and the orders are confirmed, the employees
**must** be informed that their orders have been delivered, and are
ready to be picked up.

Unlike sending and confirming orders, notifications must be sent
individually, and cannot be sent in a batch.

To notify the user their product has arrived, click the
`fa-envelope`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Send
Notification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the end of
each product line. An email is sent to the user informing them their
products have been delivered.

## Control Vendors {#lunch/control_vendors}

All orders for all vendors, both past and present, can be found in the
*Control Vendors* dashboard. To access these records, navigate to
`Lunch app --> Manager --> Control Vendors`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

All orders appear in a list view, grouped alphabetically by
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The list loads with all
vendors expanded to show all order lines for every vendor, by default.

The following information appears in the list:

- `Order Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date the order
  was placed.
- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the vendor the product is
  being ordered from.
- `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the specific product
  ordered.
- `Extras`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: any extras selected for
  the product.
- `Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: any information needed to
  be sent to the vendor.
- `User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the user who ordered the
  product.
- `Lunch Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: where the product
  is set to be delivered.
- `Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total price for the
  product, including all extras.
- `Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the current status of the
  product.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the company under which
  the order was placed. This only appears in a multi-company database.

Orders can be `cancelled <lunch/cancel>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`sent to the vendor <lunch/send-orders>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`confirmed <lunch/confirm-orders>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} upon
arrival, and `employees can be notified
<lunch/notify>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} using the same method as
on the `Today's Orders <lunch/todays-orders>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} dashboard.

![A list view of all the orders as seen in the Control Vendors dashboard.](management/control.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The difference between the
`Today's Orders <lunch/todays-orders>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
dashboard and the
`Control Vendors <lunch/control_vendors>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
dashboard is that the *Today\'s Orders* dashboard **only** displays
orders for the current day, while the
`Control Vendors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard displays
**all** orders made in the **Lunch** app.

# Orders

The **Lunch** app lets employees place lunch orders, see what is
available each day, and check their account balance, all from one place.

When the **Lunch** application is opened, the
`Order Your Lunch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard loads.
This view is also accessible by navigating to
`Lunch app --> My Lunch --> New Order`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

The `Order Your Lunch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard
provides a summary of lunch offerings, the user\'s account information,
and the current day\'s orders, along with their statuses.

## Order Your Lunch

On the main `Order Your Lunch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
dashboard, all the necessary information needed to place an order is
visible. The default filter is for the current day (example:
`fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Wednesday`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}), which shows only products that can be purchased that
day, based on the
`vendor's availability <lunch/availability>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

The left-side of the dashboard displays the various
`Categories`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of products available,
along with the `Vendors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} supplying
the products. To the right of each line is a number, indicating how many
products are associated with that category or vendor.

To filter the products by categories or vendors, click the checkbox next
to the desired category or vendor to view only items within those
selections. Multiple selections can be made in each section.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If multiple selections are made, **only** products that fall under
**all** the selected options are shown.
::::

The right side of the dashboard, which serves as an account hub,
displays the user, their location, the current date, their account
balance (located in the `fa-money`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Available
Balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field), and order details
for the current day, if any orders have been placed.

The middle section displays all the products in a default Kanban view.
Each product card displays the name, cost, vendor, photo, and
description of the product. If the product is configured as new, it also
displays a green `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tag.

![The Lunch app dashboard.](orders/dashboard.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Anywhere a vendor\'s name is listed in the **Lunch** app, such as on
Kanban product cards, their phone number is listed, as well.
::::

## Placing orders

To place a lunch order, navigate to the main
`Order Your Lunch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard by
either opening the **Lunch** app or by navigating to
`Lunch app --> My Lunch --> New Order`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

### Select the location

Ensure the location set in the account hub on the right-side of the
`Order Your Lunch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard is
correct. Click the `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
drop-down menu to view all **Lunch** app locations, and select the
user\'s current location (or the location the user wants their lunch
delivered to).

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The user\'s work schedule, which indicates where they work each day, is
**not** reflected in the `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. Every available location must be configured in the **lunch** app,
and all locations are available to all users in the database, regardless
of work location. This way, users can order lunch and have it delivered
to the location where they *will be* during lunchtime.

For example, an employee works in the factory and has a lunch meeting
with their supervisor at the main office, two blocks away. The employee
selects the main office as their location in the **Lunch** app, and
their order is delivered to the main office rather than the factory.
::::

### Select the date

The **Lunch** app allows for placing orders not only for the current
day, but also for ordering future meals. This feature allows users to
plan meals in advance, without having to place daily orders.

Click the date on the right side of the
`Order Your Lunch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard to open
a calendar pop-up window. Click on the desired date to select it. Any
products added are for delivery on the selected date.

Multiple products with multiple delivery dates can be ordered at once;
each day does not need to be processed separately.

### Add products to an order

From the `Order Your Lunch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
dashboard, click on a desired product to add it to an order; it appears
in the *Configure Your Order* pop-up window.

At the top of the pop-up window is the product image, name, and price.
Beneath that, there are potential `Extras`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} fields that showcase any
`extra items or options <lunch/extras>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
such as toppings or drinks. Click the checkbox next to any desired
extras present in the `Extras`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields
to add them to the order.

Each extra option is organized by a category, complete with its name and
price. As extras are selected, the displayed price at the top of the
pop-up window updates to reflect all current selections.

Beneath the `Extras`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is the
`Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the product,
followed by a `Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. The
`Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is used to enter vital
information that is then sent to the vendor regarding the order, such as
any special requests or food allergies.

When all selections for the product have been made, click the
`Add To Cart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
lower-left of the pop-up window. To cancel the order, click the
`Discard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![The pop-up window for a personal pizza, with all the extras selected.](orders/cheese-dog.png)

#### Errors

There can be several reasons why an order cannot be placed: a
`lack of funds
<lunch/insufficient-funds>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, an
`incomplete order <lunch/incomplete>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, or
being outside the vendors
`operating hours <lunch/outside-hours>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

##### Insufficient funds {#lunch/insufficient-funds}

If the price for the item in the
`Configure Your Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
exceeds the `Available Balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
the user, the following error appears:

[Your wallet does not contain enough money to order that. To add some
money to your wallet, please contact your lunch manager.]{.title-ref}

Additionally, the `Add To Cart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button is hidden, and only the `Discard`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button appears.

If this error appears, the user must
`add funds to their lunch account <user-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} through a **Lunch** app administrator before placing the
order.

##### Incomplete orders {#lunch/incomplete}

Depending on how the various
`extras <lunch/configure-extras>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are
configured for a vendor, it is possible to receive an error when
attempting to add products to the cart.

An error occurs when a configured product **requires** the user to
select an option in the `Extras`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, but the user neglects to make one.

When this occurs, a `Validation Error`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears. The error is briefly explained
in the pop-up window. Click `Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to close the window, and make any necessary changes to the
`Configure Your Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

::: example
The vendor, The Pizza Palace, provides a free beverage with any
purchase. Their products are configured so that a beverage selection is
**required** in the `Extras`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
*before* adding one of their products to the cart.

If a selection is **not** made, an error occurs. The message that
appears is [You have to order one and only one Free Beverage with
Purchase]{.title-ref}.

![The :guilabel:\`Validation Error\` pop-up window with the specific error for the free
beverage displayed.](orders/error.png)
:::

##### Outside vendor hours {#lunch/outside-hours}

Each vendor in the **Lunch** app has their
`availability <lunch/availability>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
configured, with both their operating hours as well as the deadline for
sending orders via email.

If a user clicks on a product for a vendor who is either closed or whose
order window is closed, the following message appears on the *Configure
Your Product* pop-up window: [The orders for this vendor have already
been sent.]{.title-ref}

Click the `Discard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and make
a selection from another vendor.

### Order summary

When items are added to an order, the items appear in the
`Your Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} summary, located on the
right-side of the `Order Your Lunch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
dashboard.

Each product is listed in its own Kanban card, with the product name,
the user\'s location, any extras added, the quantity, a status tag, the
delivery date for the order, and the total amount.

The available tags that can be displayed for each item in the
`Your Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section are:

- `To Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The product has been
  added to the cart, but has not been purchased yet by the user yet.
  This tag appears in gray.
- `Ordered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The product has been
  purchased by the user and is waiting to be sent to the vendor by a
  **Lunch** app manager. This tag appears in purple.

Product quantities can be adjusted by clicking the
`fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(plus)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `fa-minus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(minus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icons beneath the listed
product. The product price adjusts in real-time to reflect the cost for
the currently selected quantity of the product.

![The \'Your Orders\' section of the dashboard, with purchasing information.](orders/your-order.png)

Beneath the `Your Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section is a
summary of the purchasing information, including the following:

- `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field displays the
  total amount for the entire day\'s lunch order, including all items
  already ordered, received, and all pending orders.
- `Already Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field
  indicates how much has been paid that day towards the
  `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} amount.
- `To Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field displays how
  much of the remaining `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  amount must be paid in order to place the currently configured order
  (items with a tag of `To Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

![The various account totals for the user\'s account.](orders/summary.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Users can place multiple orders throughout the day, and are not
restricted to a single lunch order per day. Multiple orders might need
to be placed, due to users forgetting to add items to an order, or
because there are multiple meals available for purchase for the office
(not just lunch), and so on.

Depending on the various vendors, and how the vendors and products are
configured, it is possible to order breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee,
and snacks.
::::

### Cancel an order

Orders can be cancelled at any time, as long as the orders have **not**
been sent to the vendor. All orders that appear in the
`Your Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section can be
cancelled. All orders that have been sent appear in the
`Passed orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and are
ineligible for cancellation.

Orders can be cancelled in two ways,
`individually <lunch/cancel-one>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, or
`in bulk
<lunch/cancel-all>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To check and ensure an order is cancelled, navigate to
`Lunch app --> My Lunch -->
My Order History`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. A gray
`Cancelled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon appears next to any
cancelled orders.
::::

### Cancel an individual item {#lunch/cancel-one}

On the `Order Your Lunch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard,
click the `fa-minus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(minus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon beneath the desired
product in the `Your Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
until the quantity is zero. The order is cancelled, and the product
disappears from the `Your Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section.

### Cancel all items {#lunch/cancel-all}

All items in the `Your Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section
of the `Order Your Lunch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard
can be cancelled at one time. Click the `Clear Order`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button at the bottom of the right-side of the
dashboard, and all products are cancelled.

### Submit an order

To place the order, click the `Order Now`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the right side of the `Order
Your Lunch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, located at the
bottom. The user is charged the amount that is displayed in the
`To Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and the cost is
deducted from their **Lunch** account balance.

Once the order is placed, the tags for the purchased items in the
`Your Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section change from gray
`To Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tags to purple
`Ordered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tags.

### Track an order

When orders have been sent to the vendors, the products move to the
`Passed orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, located on
the right-side of the `Order Your Lunch`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard. All `Passed orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} are collapsed, by default. Click the
`fa-chevron-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(expand)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and all past orders
appear in their own Kanban card.

Each Kanban card displays the product name, cost, and delivery location
and date for the product.

Additionally, each Kanban card has one of the following status tags:

- `Ordered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This tag appears in blue
  and indicates the order was sent to the vendor, but has not been
  received yet.
- `Received`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This tag appears in
  green, and indicates that the order has arrived at the location, and
  has been verified by the **Lunch** app administrator.

### Receive an order

When orders are received at the delivery location, the **Lunch** app
manager confirms them, and a notification is sent to the employee who
ordered the food via email.

## My Orders

To view a full list of all orders placed in the **Lunch** app for the
currently signed-in user, navigate to
`Lunch app --> My Lunch --> My Order History`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. This navigates to the
`My Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard. The data is
filtered by `My Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and grouped
by `Order Date: Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, by default,
both of which are located in the search bar.

All products appear in a list view, organized by date. The list displays
the `Order Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Extras`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `User`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Lunch Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} information. If in a
multi-company database, a `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column also appears.

The total cost for each day\'s orders is displayed on the top line
containing the order date. At the bottom of the list, beneath all the
lines, the overall total amount paid for all the orders appears, under
the `Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

At the end of each product line with a status of
`Ordered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`To Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
`fa-times`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Cancel`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button appears. Click `fa-times`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Cancel`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to cancel that
product order. Once a product order has been cancelled, the money paid
for that product is refunded and appears in the user\'s account.

At the end of each product line with a status of
`Received`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
`fa-history`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Re-order`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button appears. Click `fa-history`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Re-order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to instantly
reorder that same product, with the same extras, if applicable. The new
order appears in the list, under the current date, and the product is
paid for, with money deducted from the user\'s account.

Any order with a status of `Cancelled`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} has a `fa-undo`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Reset`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the end of the
line. To un-cancel and order, click the `fa-undo`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Reset`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and the
product status changes to `Ordered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The list view that appears when navigating to the My Orders dashboard.](orders/my-orders.png)

## My Account

To view a summary of all transactions in the user\'s account, navigate
to `Lunch app
--> My Lunch --> My Account History`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Doing so reveals the
`My Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

The default presentation of the `My Account`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard displays all entries, from newest to oldest.
The `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are the only fields
displayed in the list.

Entries with a negative figure listed in the `Amount`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column represent products purchased in the **Lunch**
app. These appear in a [\$-XX.XX]{.title-ref} format.

Entries with a positive balance either represent funds added to the
user\'s lunch account, or cancelled orders that were eventually refunded
to the user. These appear in a [\$XX.XX]{.title-ref} format.

# Products

Odoo\'s **Lunch** app does *not* come with any products preconfigured.
The individual products being offered must first be configured before
orders can be placed.

To add and configure products for the **Lunch** app, navigate to
`Lunch app -->
Configuration --> Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Next, click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
top-left corner, and a blank product form loads.

Enter the following information on the form:

- `Product Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the name for
  the product. This field is **required**.
- `Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  drop-down menu, select the `category
  <lunch/product-categories>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} this product
  falls under. This field is **required**.
- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down menu,
  select the vendor that supplies this product. This field is
  **required**.
- `Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the price for the
  product. The currency is determined by the company\'s localization.
- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a description
  of the product in this field. This description appears beneath the
  product photo when users are viewing the day\'s options.
- `New Until`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the calendar
  popover, select the date on which the product is no longer labeled as
  new. Until this date, a green [New]{.title-ref} tag appears on the
  product.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the companies this product is available for. If this
  field is left blank, this product does **not** appear for **any**
  company.
- **Image**: Hover over the image box in the top-right corner of the
  form, and click the `fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(pencil)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon that appears. A
  file explorer pop-up window appears. Navigate to the image, then click
  `Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![A product form filled out for a nine inch pizza.](products/product.png)

## Product categories {#lunch/product-categories}

Product categories organize the offerings in the **Lunch** app, and
allows users to filter offerings when reviewing the menu for the day.

To add or modify categories, navigate to
`Lunch app --> Configuration: Product
Categories`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. The available
categories appear in a list view.

In the **Lunch** app, there are four default categories:
`Sandwich`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Pizza`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Burger`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Drinks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To add a new category, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the top-left corner, and a blank category
form loads.

Enter a name in the `Product Category`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. If the category is company-specific and should
only appear for a certain company, select the
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu.

If desired, add a photo for the category. Hover over the image box in
the top-right, and click the `fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(pencil)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon that appears. This
opens a file explorer pop-up window. Navigate to the image, then click
`Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Manage user accounts

In Odoo\'s **Lunch** application, users pay for products directly from
their **Lunch** app account. For funds to appear in their account, a
**Lunch** app manager **must** transfer funds into each user\'s account.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To add funds and manage user accounts, the user must have
`Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} access rights set for
the **Lunch** application. This is verified by navigating to
`Settings app
-->`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
`oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Manage Users`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, click on a user
to view their various settings and access rights.

For more information, refer to the
`Access rights <../../general/users/access_rights/>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation.
::::

The **Lunch** application does **not** directly interface in any way
with software or products linked to any monetary accounts or billing.
Money **cannot** be transferred from users\' bank accounts, nor can
users\' credit cards be charged.

Odoo\'s **Lunch** application **only** allows for manual entries of cash
exchanges that are handled by the **Lunch** app manager. It is up to
each individual company to create the method with which lunch accounts
are replenished.

::: example
Some examples of how money can be organized and transferred within a
company:

- Cash is handed to the **Lunch** app manager, who then updates the
  user\'s account.
- Money is automatically deducted from the user\'s paychecks, then the
  **Lunch** app manager updates the account when paychecks are issued.
  This requires `adding a salary attachment
  <payroll/worked-days-inputs>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for the
  user\'s payslip in the *Payroll* app.
- Companies can sell \"lunch tickets\" at a set price (for example, one
  ticket costs \$5.00). Users can purchase tickets from a **Lunch** app
  manager, who then updates the user\'s account.
:::

## Cash Moves {#lunch/cash-moves}

To add funds to user accounts, each cash move must be individually
logged. To view all cash move records, or create a new cash move,
navigate to `Lunch app --> Manager --> Cash
Moves`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Doing so reveals the
`Cash Moves`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

On the `Cash Moves`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, all
cash moves are presented in a default list view, displaying each
record\'s `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The total of all the cash
moves is displayed at the bottom of the `Amount`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column.

![The list view of all cash moves.](user-accounts/cash.png)

### Add funds

To add funds to a lunch account, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, located in the top-left corner of the
`Cash Moves`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

A blank `Cash Moves`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form loads.
Enter the following information on the form:

- `User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the user depositing
  cash into their account from the drop-down menu. If the user is not in
  the database, they can be created by typing their name in the
  `User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and clicking either
  `Create "user"`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create the
  user and edit the `Create User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  form.
- `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: using the calendar popover,
  select the date the transaction occurred.
- `Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the amount being
  added to the lunch account.
- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter a brief
  description of the transaction.

![The cash move form filled out for a transaction of \$40.00.](user-accounts/cash-move-form.png)

## Control Accounts

An overview of every transaction in the **Lunch** app, including all
cash deposits and purchases, can be viewed on the main *Control
Accounts* dashboard. To access this dashboard, navigate to
`Lunch app --> Manager --> Control Accounts.`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}

All transactions are grouped `By Employee`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and listed alphabetically by the user\'s first name.
At the end of the user\'s name, a number appears. This indicates the
number of individual records logged for that user.

The default view is to have all individual transactions hidden. To view
all transactions for a user, click the
`fa-caret-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(triangle)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the left of the
desired name to expand that specific group.

Each record includes the `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Control Accounts dashboard with two employee\'s transactions expanded.](user-accounts/control-accounts.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

This list only displays the various transactions within the **Lunch**
app, and does **not** allow modifications to be made to any records
listed.

Cash moves can be modified, but **only** from the
`Cash Moves <lunch/cash-moves>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} dashboard,
not from the `Control Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
dashboard.

It is **not** possible to modify any product-related records.

# Vendors

Before `products can be added <products>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
to the **Lunch** app, the restaurants that provide the food needs to be
configured.

To add a new vendor, first navigate to
`Lunch app --> Configuration --> Vendors`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Here, all currently configured vendors for the
**Lunch** app appear in a default Kanban view. To change to a list view,
click the `oi-view-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(List)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the top-right
corner.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

No vendors are preconfigured in the **Lunch** app, so all vendors
**must** be added to the database.
::::

A placeholder `Lunch Supplier`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} card
appears on the `Vendors`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard,
by default. Click on this card, and configure the following fields on
the vendor form:

- `Vendor information <lunch/vendor-info>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
- `Availability <lunch/availability>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
- `Orders <lunch/orders>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
- `Extras <lunch/extras>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

After the first vendor is configured, add more vendors by clicking the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the top-left corner,
and configure the new lunch supplier form. Repeat for all needed
vendors.

## Vendor information {#lunch/vendor-info}

- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a name for the
  vendor in this field.

- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (beneath the line for
  vendor name): Using the drop-down menu, select the corresponding
  vendor in the **Contacts** app. If the vendor has not already been
  created, type in the vendor name, and click
  `Create "new vendor name"`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add
  them. Alternatively, click `Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to create the vendor and edit the vendor contact
  form. The vendor contact form allows for more details to be entered,
  such as contact information.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  If a selection is made to the drop-down `Vendor`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field, the `Vendor`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} text field (above, for the vendor\'s name) updates
  with the name of the vendor chosen from the drop-down menu.

  The list of vendors that is presented in the drop-down menu is pulled
  from the **Contacts** application.
  ::::

- `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the vendor\'s
  address in the various fields.

- `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the vendor\'s email
  in this field.

- `Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the vendor\'s phone
  number in this field.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If this vendor is only
  available to a specific company, select the company from the drop-down
  menu. If this field is left blank, the vendor\'s items are available
  to **all** companies. This field **only** appears in a multi-company
  database.

![The top portion of the vendor form filled out.](vendors/vendor-info.png)

## Availability {#lunch/availability}

The `AVAILABILITY`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section presents a
table with two rows. The days of the week populate the top row, and the
bottom row has checkboxes. Tick the corresponding checkbox for each day
of the week the vendor is available.

By default, Monday through Friday are ticked.

![The default view of the availability section, with Mon-Fri enabled.](vendors/availability.png)

## Orders {#lunch/orders}

The `ORDERS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the vendor
form details which locations the vendor is available for, in addition to
how and when orders are placed and received.

- `Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select `Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if the
  vendor delivers to the office, or select
  `No Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if orders must be
  picked up.

- `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select which locations
  are able to order from this vendor. Multiple locations can be
  selected. If this field is left blank, **all** locations can order
  from the vendor.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  An [HQ Office]{.title-ref} location is created by default when
  creating a database, and is available to select from the list.
  ::::

- `Send Order By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Click the radio
  button to select how orders are sent to the vendor. The available
  options are `Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Order Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field **only**
  appears if `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected in
  the `Send Order By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Enter
  the time that an order must be emailed for it to be accepted. Enter
  the time in the following format: [HH:MM]{.title-ref}. Then select
  either `AM`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `PM`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu, next
  to the time field.

![The orders section of a vendor form, with all fields filled out.](vendors/orders.png)

## Extras {#lunch/extras}

When ordering an item in the **Lunch** app, optional extra items,
sometimes referred to as *add-ons*, can be shown. These can be
configured in any manner that suits the products being offered.

By default, Odoo allows for three types of extra items, which can be
thought of as *categories*. By default, the first type (or *category*)
of add-ons is labeled [Extras]{.title-ref}, the second is labeled
[Beverages]{.title-ref}, and the third is labeled [Extra Label
3]{.title-ref}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When configuring the extras, it is important to keep in mind that all
the extras configured appear for **every item** offered by the vendor.
That means that only items which apply to **all** products from the
vendor should be added.
::::

### Configure extras {#lunch/configure-extras}

Enter the following information for each of the three available extra
sections:

- `Extra (#) Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a name for
  the type of extra, such as [Toppings]{.title-ref}. This can be thought
  of as a *category*.
- `Extra (#) Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select how
  the extras are selected. The options are:
  - `None or More`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this
    option if the user is not required to make a selection.
  - `One or More`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this option
    to **require** the user to make **at least one** selection.
  - `Only One`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this option to
    **require** the user to make **only one** selection.

### Add extras

After the labels and quantities have been configured for an extra
category, the individual extra items must be added for each category.

Click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the bottom of
the list that appears on the right-hand side of the extra category.
Enter the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for each item being added.
The price can remain at [\$0.00]{.title-ref} if there is no cost. This
is common for items like disposable silverware or condiments.

::: example
For a pizzeria that only offers personal pizzas, see their extras
configured as follows:

The first extra is configured for the various toppings they offer. The
`Extra 1 Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
[Toppings]{.title-ref}, and the `Extra 1 Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is set to `None or More`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The various toppings are then added, with their
corresponding costs.

![The first of the extras configured for pizza toppings.](vendors/extras.png)

The pizzeria also offers a free beverage with any purchase. To set this
up, the `Extra
2 Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
[Beverages]{.title-ref}, and the `Extra 2 Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is set to `Only
One`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The various beverage choices
are added, and the cost for each remains zero.

# Lunch

The **Lunch** application in Odoo allows users to conveniently order
food and pay for their meal directly from the database.

Before employees can use the **Lunch** application, there are a number
of configurations that need to be made:
`settings <lunch/settings>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`vendors <lunch/vendors>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, `locations
<lunch/locations>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`products <lunch/products>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, and
`product categories
<lunch/product-categories>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Once these
are created and configured, employees can view offerings and order food.

## Settings {#lunch/settings}

In the `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu, only two
items need to be configured: overdraft settings and notifications. To
access the settings, navigate to `Lunch app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Configure the following:

- `Lunch Overdraft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the
  maximum overdraft amount for employees. The currency format is
  determined by the localization setting of the company.
- `Reception notification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: set the
  message users receive via the **Discuss** app when their food has been
  delivered. The default message [Your lunch has been delivered. Enjoy
  your meal!]{.title-ref} populates this field, but can be modified, if
  desired.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If a database has multiple languages installed, many forms in the
**Lunch** application have the option of entering translations for
various fields.

If translations are available to be configured, a language code appears
next to a translatable field on a form. To add translations for that
field, click the two letter language code (for example,
`EN`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for English) and a translation
pop-up window appears.

The following is an example for the
`Reception notification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field in the
settings menu:

Navigate to `Lunch app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click the `EN`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
In the top-right of the text box beneath the
`Reception notification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. A
`Translate: company_lunch_notify_message`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window loads with the option to enter a
translation for the other languages used by the database.

The first column lists the different languages in alphabetical order,
with the currently selected language in bold. The second column has the
currently configured message in each column. The last column in the
far-right provides a text box to type in a translation for each
language.

Enter the text that should appear for each language, then click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The translation text box, with the current language highlighted, and the Arabic
translation field highlighted.](lunch/translation.png)
::::

## Locations {#lunch/locations}

By default, Odoo creates an [HQ Office]{.title-ref} location when the
**Lunch** application is installed. If a company has more than one
location, they must be configured.

To add a location, navigate to
`Lunch app --> Configuration --> Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. The currently configured locations appear in a
list view. Click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in
the top-left corner and a blank line appears beneath the last location
in the list.

Enter the name of the location in the field. Next, click into the
`Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to the right of the
name, and enter the location\'s address. It is possible to enter
multiple lines in the address field.

Repeat this for all locations that need to be added.

![A list view of the locations with the new button highlighted.](lunch/locations.png)

## Alerts

It is possible to set up alerts that can either be displayed in the
**Lunch** app, or be sent to specific employees via the **Discuss** app.

No alerts are preconfigured by default. To set up an alert, navigate to
`Lunch app
--> Configuration --> Alerts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
top-left corner and a blank lunch alert form loads. Enter the following
information on the form:

- `Alert Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter a name for the
  alert. This should be short and descriptive, such as [New Lunch
  Vendor]{.title-ref} or [Order by 11:00 AM]{.title-ref}. This field is
  **required**.

- `Display`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select whether the alert
  is visible in the **Lunch** app (`Alert in
  app)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or sent to employees via the
  **Discuss** app in a chat window (`Chat
  notification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

  - `Recipients`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field only
    appears if `Chat notification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
    selected for the `Display`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    option. Select who receives the chat alert. The options are:
    `Everyone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Employee who ordered last week`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Employee who
    ordered last month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
    `Employee who ordered last year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the locations
  the alert should appear for from the drop-down menu. Multiple
  locations can be selected. This field is **required**, therefore, if
  the alert applies to all locations, select all the locations from the
  drop-down menu.

- `Show Until`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the alert should
  expire on a specific date, select the date from the calendar picker.

- `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this option is on
  (appears green) by default. To turn off the alert, click the toggle so
  that it no longer appears green.

- `Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the alert message
  in this field. This field is **required**.

- `Notification Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the
  days of the week the alert should be sent. By default, all seven days
  are active. Click on a checkbox to change the setting from active to
  inactive.

  If `Chat notification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} was selected
  for the `Display`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, a
  `Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field also appears. Enter
  the time the chat message should be sent. Next, select if the time is
  either `AM`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `PM`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} using the drop-down menu to
  the right of the `Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

# Commissions

Commissions are payments made to employees that are earned as part of
their salary. The payments are awarded after a sale has been made, and
the amount depends on how much the sale was. Typically the amount is
either a percentage of the sale, or a set commission based on a
structure created by the company.

To pay an employee a commission they earned, a separate commission
paycheck must be issued to the employee. In Odoo, a commission payslip
is referred to as a *warrant payslip*.

## Create warrant payslips

Warrant payslips are generated directly from the
`Payslips Batches`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, which
is accessed by navigating to
`Payroll app --> Payslips --> Batches`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

First, click the `Generate Warrant Payslips`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the top-left corner. Doing so reveals a
`Generate Warrant Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, in which the necessary information **must** be filled out.

Set the time frame the commission was earned, in the two fields next to
`Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click into each field, and
a calendar pop-up window loads. Navigate to the desired date and click
on it to select it.

Using the drop-down menu, select the `Department`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the corresponding field. When a department is
selected, the employees listed for that department appear in the
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, below.

If a file is needed for the record, upload a file to the
`Import File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, such as a sales
invoice, using the `Upload your file`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button. Any file type is accepted.

Under the `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, enter
the individual `Commission Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
for each employee in the far-right column. To remove an employee, click
the `fa-trash-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(trash)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to remove the line.

Add a new commission by clicking `Add a Line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and entering the `Employee`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and the appropriate
`Commission Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Once all the commissions are properly entered, click the
`Generate Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to create
the warrant payslips in a group, which is reffered to as a *pay run* in
Odoo, or click `Export`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to export a
CSV file of the commissions.

`Process the pay run <payroll/pay-run-process>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} in the same way as a typical batch to complete the payment
process.

# Contracts

Every employee in Odoo is required to have a running contract in order
to be paid. A contract outlines the terms of an employee\'s position,
compensation, working hours, and any other relevant terms.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Contract documents (PDFs) are uploaded and organized using the
**Documents** application, and are signed using the **Sign**
application. Ensure these applications are installed to send and sign
contracts. Please refer to the
`../../productivity/documents`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
`../../productivity/sign`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} documentation
for more information.
::::

## Contracts dashboard {#payroll/contract-dashboard}

Both the **Payroll** and **Employees** apps display *identical employee
contract information*.

To access the contracts dashboard from the **Employees** app, navigate
to `Employees
app --> Employees --> Contracts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. To access the contracts dashboard from the
**Payroll** app, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Contracts --> Contracts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

The `Contracts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard displays
all employee contracts in a default list view, grouped by
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The available status
groupings are `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Running`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Expired`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Cancelled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Each grouping displays
the number of contracts within the grouping.

## Create a contract {#payroll/new-contract}

To create a new contract, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the `Contracts dashboard
<payroll/contract-dashboard>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and a blank
contract form appears.

### General information section {#payroll/gen-info}

Enter the following information in the top-half of the blank contract
form:

- `Contact Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Type in the
  name or title for the contract, such as [John Smith
  Contract]{.title-ref}. This field is **required**.

- `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the employee the contract is for.

- `Contract Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  date the contract goes into effect. Contracts can be created
  retroactively, or be created to begin at a future date. The current
  date populates this required field by default, but can be modified.

- `Contract End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the
  contract has a firm end date, enter the date in this field. Leave this
  field blank if the contract runs indefinitely, or until a new contract
  is made (when the employee has a change to their job title, salary, or
  benefits).

- `Working Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select one of
  the available working schedules the employee is expected to work, from
  the drop-down menu. The selected working schedule determines how `work
  entries <work_entries>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} are generated,
  which determines the employees schedule and compensation. If this
  field is left blank, this allows the employee to work as many or as
  few hours as desired every week, with no restrictions.

### Salary information tab

The `Salary Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab is where
the specific details of how much and how often the employee is paid.
Fill in the following fields in this tab:

- `Wage Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select what kind of pay the employee receives. The two default
  options are `Fixed Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Hourly Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Select
  `Fixed Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for salaried
  employees, and select `Hourly Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  for employees who are paid based on their logged worked hours.
- `Schedule Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select how often the employee is paid. The default options are
  `Annually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Semi-annually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Quarterly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Bi-monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Semi-monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Bi-weekly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Weekly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Daily`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the amount the
  employee receives each pay period. The first field allows for a wage
  to be entered, the second field displays how often the pay is issued
  to the employee. The second field *cannot* be modified, and is updated
  when the `Schedule Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
  changes.
- `Yearly Cost (Real)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field
  automatically updates after the `Schedule
  Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `Wage`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} fields are entered. This amount is the total yearly
  cost for the employer. This field can be modified. However, if this is
  modified, the `Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field updates,
  accordingly. Ensure both the `Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  and `Yearly Cost (Real)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are
  correct if this field is modified.
- `Monthly Cost (Real)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field
  automatically updates after the `Schedule
  Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `Wage`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} fields are entered. This amount is the total monthly
  cost for the employer. This field **cannot** be modified, and is
  calculated based on the `Yearly Cost
  (Real)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![](contracts/salary-info.png){alt="The Salary Information tab filled out."}

### Details tab

The `Details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the contract
houses the contract template information, accounting information (refer
to the
`country-specific localization document <payroll_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for more information), any part time work information, and
notes. Fill out the following fields in this tab:

- `Contract Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  drop-down menu, select a `contract template
  <payroll/contract-template>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to use when
  making an offer to an applicant.

- `Originated Offer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field
  automatically populates with the original offer sent to the employee.
  This field is **not** modifiable, and is only populated if applicable.

- `Part Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick the checkbox if
  the contract is for part time work. Once enabled, a percentage field
  appears next to the checkbox. The percentage **cannot** be modified,
  and automatically updates based on the selected
  `Working Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the top-half
  of the contract, compared to the typical working schedule for the
  company (typically 40 hours/week).

  - `Standard Calendar`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field
    is automatically populated with the default working schedule for the
    company. In most cases, this is
    `Standard 40 hours/week`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  - `Part Time Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    Using the drop-down menu, select the work entry type that generates
    the balance of a full-time working schedule.

  ::: example
  An employee contract is being created for a part-time employee who
  works 20 hours a week.

  To configure this, the employee\'s
  `Working Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to `20
  Hours/Part time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
  `general information section <payroll/gen-info>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}. In the `Details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
  the `Part Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox is ticked,
  and the percentage is set to [50]{.title-ref}. The
  `Standard Calendar`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
  `Standard 40 hours/week`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
  `Part Time Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set
  to `Unpaid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  When a typical work week is processed in the **Payroll** app, the
  employee generates twenty
  (20) hours of regular work entries under the work entry type
       [Attendance]{.title-ref}, and another twenty

  \(20\) hours of work entries under the work entry type
  [Unpaid]{.title-ref}, for a total of forty (40) hours worth of work
  entries.
  :::

- `Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter any relevant notes
  for the contract in this field.

![](contracts/details-tab.png){alt="The Details tab filled out."}

### Signatories tab

The `Signatories`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab is where the
default contract templates are selected, for both new and updated
contracts.

Using the drop-down menu, select the default contract template to use
when creating a new or updated contract, in the respective fields.

Once a PDF template is selected, any mapped signature fields in the file
appear in a list, below the selection, identifying who must sign the
document. These fields **cannot** be updated.

Any changes to the template and signatories but be done in the **Sign**
app, where contract templates are uploaded, modified, and stored.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `PDF Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields are only
visible if the **Sign** app is installed, along with the
`hr_contract_salary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`hr_contract_salary_payroll`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} `modules
<../../general/apps_modules>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
::::

![](contracts/signatories.png){alt="The Signatories tab with the roles specified for signing."}

### Personal documents tab

Occasionally, additional paperwork may be required when creating a
contract, such as legal documents declaring the employee is able to work
in the country. When this situation occurs, Odoo allows for one image
file of the necessary document to be attached to a contract in the
`Personal
Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

Click the `Upload your file`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button,
navigate to the desired document, and click `Select`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to attach the file to the contract. The file name
appears on the `Image`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This tab **only** appears after an `Employee`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is selected. Additionally, only image files can be
attached in this field at this time.
::::

### Salary attachments

After an employee is selected for the contract, a
`fa-book`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Salary Attachments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button
appears at the top of the page.

For new employees who do not currently have a contract, the smart button
displays `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If the contract is
being updated for a current employee who already has salary attachments
configured, the smart button displays the number of salary attachments
currently running.

`Create or update any necessary salary attachments <salary_attachments>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for the contract, before sending.

## Send a contract

After a contract has been created and configured, the next step is to
send it to the employee or applicant. Click the
`Generate Offer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and the
`Offer for (Employee)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form loads.

The `Offer for (Employee)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form
displays all the basic information from the contract, as well as a link
the employee can use to sign the contract. The last field on the form is
a `Validity Days Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. This
indicates how long the offer is valid. Enter the desired number of days
in the field. The default is [30]{.title-ref} days.

Click `Send By Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a pop-up
email window loads, using a preconfigured default email template. Click
`Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to send the offer.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

In order to send a contract using the `Generate Offer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, there **must** be an employee signature field
on the contract PDF being sent.
::::

![Send the contract to the employee via one of the buttons.](contracts/send-contract.png)

## Contract status

When creating and sending out a contract, the default status of the
contract is `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Once there is a minimum of one completed signature on the document, the
status changes to `Partially Signed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Internal users, such as HR and recruitment employees, are alerted in the
database when there is a signature requested of them.

After all required parties have signed the contract, the status changes
to `Fully Signed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

All status changes happen automatically as the document is signed.

## Contract templates {#payroll/contract-template}

Contract *templates* eliminate the need to configure new contracts every
time an employee is hired.

Having multiple contract templates allows for faster contract creation
for different types of employment positions that are commonly filled,
such as full time, part time, seasonal, etc.

Contract templates are created through the **Payroll** app configuration
menu, and stored in the **Documents** app.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To access contract templates, the **Salary Configurator**
([hr_contract_salary]{.title-ref}) module **must** be
`installed <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

To view all contract templates, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration -->
Templates`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

The `Contract Templates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page lists
all existing templates. Click a template line to open and edit it.

To create a new contract template, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. Then, enter the following information on the
blank contract template form that appears:

  description for the template. This should be clear and easily
  understood, as this name appears in the **Recruitment** application,
  as well.
- `Working Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  desired working schedule the contract applies to from the drop-down
  menu. If a new working schedule is needed, create a

  contract from the drop-down menu. This list is the same as the
  *employment type*.
- `Wage on Payroll`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  monthly wage in the field.
- `HR Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  employee responsible for validating contracts, using this template,
  from the drop-down menu.

  `Semi-monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Bi-weekly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Weekly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Daily`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the gross wage. The
  time period presented in this field is based on what is selected for
  the `Scheduled Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. It is
  recommended to populate the `Yearly Cost (Real)`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field *first*, since that entry updates this field
  automatically.
- `Yearly Cost (Real)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  total yearly cost the employee costs the employer. When this value is
  entered, the `Monthly Cost (Real)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  is automatically updated.

# Headcount report

The *Headcount report* in the **Payroll** app shows the number of
employees on payroll and allows headcount comparisons between different
periods of time.

## Create a headcount report

Create a headcount report to see the number of employees at a specific
time or compare headcounts across periods.

To create a headcount report, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Reporting --> Headcount`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

- Report name: generated automatically as [Headcount for (Company Name)
  on the (YYYY-MM-DD)]{.title-ref} and **cannot** be modified.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: populated automatically
  (works in both single and multi-company databases)
- `From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}/`To`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} dates: defaults to current date (from) and blank
  (to). Adjust these to define the period to analyze.

![A headcount report form filled out for the third quarter of 2025.](headcount/new-headcount.png)

Next, click `Populate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to generate
the report.

At the top of the form, a `fa-people`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button appears.
Clicking the button displays the total number of employees for the
selected period.

## View all headcount reports

See how the company headcount has changed over time by viewing all
headcount reports in a list view.

To view all headcount reports, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Reporting --> Headcount`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

# Pay runs

*Pay runs* are used to generate multiple
`payslips <payslips>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} at once and process
them in a group, rather than create and process individual payslips.
This method not only helps the payroll department pay employees in less
time, but it also helps keep payslips organized.

Typically, a company\'s payroll department
`creates a new pay run <payroll/new-pay-run>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for each salary structure, for every pay period (usually
weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly). If desired, pay runs can be further
organized by department, job position, etc.

Once a pay run is made,
`payslips are added to the pay run <payroll/add-payslips>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, then the pay run is processed, and employees are paid.

## View pay runs

To view all the pay runs in the database, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Payslips -->
Pay Runs`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} to display all payslip
pay runs that have been created. These payslip pay runs are displayed in
a list view, grouped by `oi-group`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (either
`Ready`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), by
default.

Each pay run displays the name, the dates it includes, the number of
payslips, and the total `employer cost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `gross`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`net`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} amounts for all payslips.

![View displaying all pay runs created.](pay_runs/pay-runs.png)

## Create a new pay run {#payroll/new-pay-run}

New pay runs can be created from the
`Work Entry <payroll/work-entry-pay-run>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`Employee
Payslips <payroll/payslips-pay-run>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, or
`Pay Runs <payroll/pay-runs-pay-run>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
dashboards.

### Work entry dashboard {#payroll/work-entry-pay-run}

To create a pay run from the work entry dashboard, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Work
Entries --> Work Entries`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. The
current time period is displayed, with the current day highlighted in
yellow.

All employees appear in a default Gantt view, with all work entries
displayed. If necessary, navigate to the desired time period.

Once all
`missing work entries are added <payroll/new-work-entry>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and all `conflicts are
resolved <payroll/conflicts>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, click the
`Generate Pay Run`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. The pay
run is created for all employees, with a status of
`Ready`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The work entries dashboard with the GeneratePay Runs button visible.](pay_runs/work-entries-pay-run.png)

### Employee payslips dashboard {#payroll/payslips-pay-run}

To create a pay run from the payslips dashboard, navigate to
`Payroll app -->
Payslips --> Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. All
payslips for all employees are displayed in a default list view, in
chronological order.

role="guilabel"} is selected, the pay run applies to *all* salary
structures. Next, select the `Pay Schedule`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, which is *how often* employees are paid. The default
options are `year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`half-year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`quarter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`2 months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `month`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `half-month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`2 weeks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `week`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
:::

Last, using the calendar selector, set the first day the pay run covers
in the first blank `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
The second field is automatically populated based on the selection in
the `Pay Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

::: example
A company pays its employees every month. To configure the pay run for
November, the `Pay Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set
to `month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the first
`Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set to [Nov
1]{.title-ref}. Once entered, the second field is automatically
populated with [Nov 30]{.title-ref}.

When the `New Pay Run`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
is configured, click `Continue`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
the pop-up window changes to a `Select Employees`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} window. All employees who match the parameters set in
the `New Pay Run`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appear in the list. Select the desired employees to add to the pay run,
or click the box next to `Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to select *all* employees in the list.

![The pay run employee selection pop-up window.](pay_runs/select-employees.png)

Once all desired employees are selected, click
`Select`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The pop-up window closes,
and the pay run appears on the screen.

### Pay runs dashboard {#payroll/pay-runs-pay-run}

To create a pay run from the pay runs dashboard, navigate to
`Payroll app -->
Payslips --> Pay Runs`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Click
the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and a
`New Pay Run`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window loads.

> Follow the same directions as if creating a
> `pay run form the payslips dashboard
> <payroll/new-pay-run-pop-up>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

## Add a payslips to a pay run {#payroll/add-payslips}

Once a
`pay run has been created <payroll/new-pay-run>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, payslips are added as part of the pay run creation. If
needed, additional payslips can be created individually, and added to a
pay run after it has been created.

To add a new payslip, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Payslips --> Payslips`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click the `New Off-Cycle`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button and a blank
`Employee Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form loads.
`Configure the payslip form <payroll/new-payslip>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and ensure the `Pay Run`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field is populated.

Once the form is configured, click `Compute Sheet`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to calculate the payslip and add it to the selected pay
run.

## Process a pay run {#payroll/pay-run-process}

After a
`pay run has been created <payroll/new-pay-run>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and `all required payslips have
been added <payroll/add-payslips>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, the
pay run must then be processed, and employees paid.

Open the desired pay run by navigating to
`Payroll app --> Payslips --> Pay Runs`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and clicking on the desired pay run.

For a pay run to be processed, it must have a status of
`Ready`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. That means the pay run has
been created and payslips have been added, but the payslips have *not*
been processed.

Click the `Create Draft Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button, then click `OK`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Confirmation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window to
confirm and create a draft of all the individual payslips in the pay
run. After this occurs, the pay run status changes to
`Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and moves to the
corresponding grouping on the `Pay Runs`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard.

At any time, the pay run needs to be reverted back to a status of
`Ready`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click the
`Revert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. This action does
**not** remove any payslips that have already been added to the pay run,
instead, the status changes back to `Ready`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

After any desired changes have been made, click
`Create Draft Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the pay run
status changes to `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

It is important to note, that if any payslips in the pay run have a
status of `Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the pay run
**cannot** revert to a status of `Ready`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

Once the status has changed to `Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, the payments must be logged in the database. Click the
`Payment Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and a pop-up
window loads, where the payment report details are entered.

Using the drop-down menu, select the `Export Format`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for the payment report. The universal option is
`CSV`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, while all other available
options depend on the installed `payroll
localization <payroll_localizations>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

Next, select the `Payment Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} using
the calendar selector. This is the date the paychecks are issued.

Some `payroll localizations <payroll_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} cause a `Bank Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field to also appear. If visible, select the journal the payslips are
logged on, using the drop-down menu.

Once the pop-up window is configured, click the
`Generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. The `Payment

Tip
:::

Odoo automatically creates the name of the pay run according to the
various selections made when creating the pay run (salary structure, pay
schedule, etc). In some situations, a company may want to rename the pay
runs, for better organization and a clearer understanding of what pay
slips are part of each pay run.

For example, a company pays its employees monthly, for both hourly and
salaried employees.

The names for their four August 2025 pay runs are:

- [Aug 1-14 2025 - Hourly]{.title-ref}
- [Aug 1-14 2025 - Salary]{.title-ref}
- [Aug 15-31 2025 - Hourly]{.title-ref}
- [Aug 15-31 2025 - Salary]{.title-ref}

# Payroll analysis

The *Payroll Analysis* report displays the total net wage for the
company, for the last 365 days. This report allows companies to view
their payroll costs and identify any trends.

To view the *Payroll Analysis* report, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Reporting -->
Payroll`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

`Net Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is the default metric
displayed in the report, but other measures can be displayed if desired,
such as *gross wage* or *days of paid time off*. Click the
`Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} button to view a
drop-down menu of other metrics to display. Click on the desired measure
to display the results.

![Payroll overview report showing payroll for the last 365 days.](payroll_analysis/payroll-report.png)

## View multiple metrics {#payroll_analysis/multiple}

It is possible to view multiple metrics at one time by viewing the
report in the *pivot table* view. This can aid management to determine
other trends, such as which departments do not take time off, or which
departments have the highest payroll costs.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Only one** measure is able to be displayed in the default
`fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Graph`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} view. Multiple measures are **only** possible in the
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Pivot`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} view.
::::

To display the data in a pivot table, click on the
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Pivot`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

The default information displayed includes the number of payslips
(`# Payslip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), the number of
`Days of Paid Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Days of Unpaid Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, along with
the `Net Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Gross Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. All the information is
organized by department.

To display more information on the report, click the
`Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} button to reveal a
drop-down menu. Click on any metric to display it on the pivot table.

![Pivot table view with the various metrics on display.](payroll_analysis/pivot.png)

## Use case: comparing payroll costs

Managers can compare payroll costs, and determine which departments have
raised their payroll costs, either by hiring more employees, or by
raising salaries.

To compare previous periods of time, first view the *Payroll Analysis*
report in a `pivot table
<payroll_analysis/multiple>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Then, click
the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Toggle Search
Panel)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the search bar, and
click `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} to reveal a list of time
periods (months, quarters, and years). Click on a desired time period,
and a `fa-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Comparison`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section appears in the
search bar. Click on one of the two available options, either
`Start Date: Previous Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Start Date:
Previous Year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The report now displays three columns of information for every displayed
measure: a column for the current time period, a column for the previous
time period, and a `Variation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column, which displays the difference between the two time periods in a
color-coded percentage (green for increases, red for decreases.)

::: example
In this example, the data shows an overall increase in the number of
payslips. Since the company pays all employees every two weeks, an
increase in the number of payslips (`#
Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) means that more employees
were hired, in this example, a 500% increase.

Additionally, both the `Net Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Gross Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} increased. The
department `RD US`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} showed the largest
growth, with both metrics increasing by approximately 350%.

## Setting up employees

### Employee settings

Create an employee by going to `Employees --> New`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Go to the `Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and configure the
`Australian Payroll`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, for
example checking if they are `Non-resident`{.interpreted-text

`Tax-free Threshold`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, their
`TFN Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Employee Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, etc.

![Employee settings tab for the Australian payroll localization.](australia/payroll-employee-settings.png)

### Employee private information

In addition, some personal employee information is required for payroll
compliance with Single Touch Payroll, and to process superannuation
payments. Open the employee\'s `Private Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab and fill in the following fields:

- `Private Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Private Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Private Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

### Contracts

Once the employee has been created, create their employment contract by
clicking the `fa-book`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Contracts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button, or by going
to `Employees --> Employees -->
Contracts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Only one contract can be active per employee at a time. However, an
employee can be assigned consecutive contracts during their employment.
::::

#### Employment contract creation: recommended steps

![Recommended steps to create an employment contract.](australia/payroll-contract-flow.png)

#### 1. Basic contractual information

- Select the `Contract Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  and `Working Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (set, or
  flexible for casual workers).
- Keep the `Salary Structure Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  set to `Australian Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This
  structure covers all of the ATO\'s tax schedules.

::: {#payroll/l10n_au/work-entry-source}
- (if using the Attendances or Planning app) Select the
  `Work Entry Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to define how
  working hours and days are accounted for on the employee\'s payslip.

  - `Working Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: work entries
    are automatically generated based on the employee\'s working
    schedule, starting from the contract\'s start date.

    ::: example
    An employee works 38 hours a week, their contract begins on 01/01,
    today\'s date is 16/01, and the user generates a pay run from 14/01
    to 20/01. The working hours on the payslip will be automatically
    calculated to be 38 hours (5 \* 7.36 hours) if no unpaid leave is
    taken.
    :::

  - `Attendances`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the working
    schedule is ignored, and work entries are only generated after
    clocking in and out of the Attendances app. Note that attendances
    can be imported.

  - `Planning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the working schedule
    is ignored, and work entries are generated from planning shifts in
    the Planning app.

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  Timesheets do not impact work entries in Odoo. If you need to import
  your timesheets in Odoo, import them by going to
  `Payroll --> Work Entries --> Work Entries`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"} instead.
  ::::
:::

#### 2. Salary Information tab

- `Wage Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Fixed Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for full-time and
  part-time employees, and `Hourly Wage`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} for casual workers. The latter allows you to add a
  `Casual
  Loading`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} percentage.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  For hourly workers, the `Hourly Wage`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field should exclude casual loading.
  ::::

- `Schedule Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: in Australia, only
  the following pay run frequencies are accepted:
  `Daily`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Weekly`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Bi-weekly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (or
  fortnightly), `Monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Quarterly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} /\*period\*: assign a wage
  to the contract according to their pay frequency. On payslips, the
  corresponding annual and hourly rates will be computed automatically.

#### 3. Australia tab

![Australia tab of a contract.](australia/payroll-contract-australia.png)

- `General`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - Add the `Regular Pay Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if
    relevant.
  - Enable `Report in BAS - W3`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if
    you choose to add PAYG withholding amounts in BAS section W3 instead
    of W2 (refer to the [ATO\'s web page on PAYG
    withholding](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/preparing-lodging-and-paying/business-activity-statements-bas/in-detail/instructions/payg-withholding-how-to-complete-your-activity-statement-labels#W3Otheramountswithheldexcludinganyamount)
    for more information).
- `Leave loading / workplace giving`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - Define whether your employees are
    `Eligible for Leave Loading`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  - Set the `Workplace Giving Employee`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} amount in exchange for deductions.
  - Set the `Salary Sacrificed Workplace Giving`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} amount (e.g., receiving a benefit instead of a
    deduction).
- `Super contributions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - Add the `Extra Negotiated Super %`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} on top of the *super guarantee*.
  - Add the `Extra Compulsory Super %`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} as per industrial agreements or awards obligations.
- `Salary sacrifice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `Salary Sacrifice Superannuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    allows employees to sacrifice part of their salary in favor of
    reportable employer superannuation contributions (RESC).

  - `Salary Sacrifice Other Benefits`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    allows them to sacrifice part of their salary towards some other
    form of benefit (refer to the [ATO\'s web page on Salary sacrificing
    for
    employees](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/jobs-and-employment-types/working-as-an-employee/salary-sacrificing-for-employees)
    for more information).

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    As of Odoo 18, salary sacrificing for other benefits currently does
    not impact fringe benefits tax (FBT) reporting.
    ::::

#### 4. Salary attachments {#payroll/l10n_au/salary-attachments}

If the employee is to receive additional recurring payments every pay
run, whether indefinitely or for a set number of periods, click the
`fa-book`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Salary Attachments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button on
the contract. Choose a `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a
`Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Around 32 recurring salary attachment types exist for Australia. These
are mostly related to allowances and child support. [Contact
us](https://www.odoo.com/help) for more information as to whether
allowances from your industry can be covered.
::::

#### 5. Run the contract

![Example of a running contract.](australia/payroll-contract-run.png)

Once all the information has been completed, change the contract stage
from `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Running`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Prepare pay runs

### Regular

Pay runs are created by going to
`Payroll --> Payslips --> Batches`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. After clicking `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, enter a `Batch Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, select a `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and click `Generate Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Steps to generate payslips.](australia/payroll-payslips-generation.png)

Employees on a pay run can be filtered down by
`Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. There is no limit to
the amount of payslips that can be created in one batch. After clicking
`Generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, one payslip is created
per employee in the `Waiting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage,
in which they can be reviewed and amended before validation.

![Generated payslips in the waiting stage.](australia/payroll-waiting-payslips.png)

On the payslip form view, there are two types of inputs:

- `Worked days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are computed based on
  the `work entry source set on the employee's
  contract <payroll/l10n_au/work-entry-source>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}. `Work entries can be configured
  <payroll/l10n_au/work-entry-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  according to different types: attendance, overtime, Saturday rate,
  Sunday rate, public holiday rate, etc.
- `Other inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are individual
  payments or amounts of `different types
  <payroll/l10n_au/other-input-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  (allowances, lump sums, deductions, termination payments, leaves,
  etc.) that have little to do with the hours worked during the current
  pay period. The
  `previously configured salary attachments <payroll/l10n_au/salary-attachments>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} are simply recurring other inputs attached to a contract.

![Worked days and other inputs of a payslip.](australia/payroll-payslips-inputs.png)

Under the `Salary Computation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
Odoo automatically computes payslip rules based on employees, contracts,
worked hours, other input types, and salary attachments.

The salary structure *Australian Employee* has 35 payslip rules that
automatically compute and dynamically display according to the payslip
inputs.

::: example
![Salary computation tab of a payslip](australia/payroll-payslip-salary.png)

The following rules apply for that pay period in the above example:

- `Basic Salary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: pre-sacrifice gross
  salary
- `Ordinary Time Earnings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: amount to
  which the super guarantee percentage needs to be applied
- `Salary Sacrifice Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: includes
  the \$150 sacrificed to superannuation
- `Taxable Allowance Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  includes the \$10 allowance (*cents per KM* in this case)
- `Taxable Salary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: gross salary
  amount minus non-taxable amounts
- `Salary Withholding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Total Withholding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: amounts to be
  withheld from the taxable salary
- `Net Salary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the employee\'s net
  wage
- `Concessional Super Contribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  in this scenario, the amount sacrificed to superannuation, payable to
  the employee\'s super fund in addition to the super guarantee
- `Super Guarantee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: as of 01 July
  2024, it is computed as 11.5% of the ordinary time earnings amount
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

As of Odoo 18, the most recent tax schedule rates (2024-2025) have been
updated for all salary rules and computations.
::::

### Out-of-cycle

In Australia, payslips created without a batch are considered to be
*out-of-cycle* runs. Create them by going to
`Payroll --> Payslips --> Individual Payslips`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. The same payslip rules apply, but the way these
payslips are submitted to the ATO in the frame of Single Touch Payroll
(STP) is slightly different.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

As of Odoo 18, adding an out-of-cycle payslip to an existing batch is
**not** recommended.
::::

## Finalise pay runs

### Validate payslips

Once all payslip data is deemed correct, click
`Create Draft Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the payslip
batch. This can also be done payslip by payslip for control reasons.

This has several impacts:

- Marking the batch and its payslips as `Done`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- Creating a draft accounting entry per payslip or one entry for the
  whole batch, depending on your payroll settings. At this stage,
  accountants can post entries to affect the balance sheet, P&L report,
  and BAS report.
- Preparing the STP submission (or payroll data to be filed to the ATO
  as part of STP compliance). This needs to be performed by the
  `STP Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} user, defined
  under `Payroll --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}.
- Preparing super contribution lines as part of SuperStream compliance.
  This needs to be done by the `HR Super Send`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} user selected under `Payroll --> Configuration -->
  Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

![Example of a draft payslip.](australia/payroll-stp-record.png)

### Submit payroll data to the ATO

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo is currently in the process of becoming compliant with STP Phase 2,
and this step described above does not submit data yet to the ATO.
::::

As per ATO requirements, STP submission for a pay run needs to be done
on or before the payday. For this reason, submit your STP data to the
ATO first before proceeding with payment. To do so, click
`Submit to ATO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the payslip batch.

On the STP record for this pay run, a few useful information is
displayed:

- a warning message if important information is missing,
- an automatically generated activity for the STP responsible user, and
- a summary of payslips contained in this pay run, auditable from this
  view.

![Example of an STP record.](australia/payroll-stp-record.png)

Once the STP record is ready to go, click
`Submit to ATO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then read and accept
the related terms and conditions.

### Pay employees

Once the ATO submission is complete, you can proceed to pay your
employees. To facilitate the payment matching process, remember to post
the payslip-related journal entries prior to validating a payment.

Although you may decide to pay your employees individually, we recommend
creating a batch payment from your payslip batch. To do so, click
`Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the payslip batch, and
select `ABA Credit Transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as the
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Selecting the payment method for a payslip batch.](australia/payroll-payment-method.png)

This has two impacts:

- Marking the batch and its payslips as `Paid`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- Creating a `Payment Batch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} linked
  to the payslip batch.

![Example of a paid batch of payslips.](australia/payroll-paid-batch.png)

When receiving the bank statement in Odoo, you can now match the
statement line with the batch payment in one click. The payment is not
reconciled against the payslip batch, and all individual payslips.

![Steps to reconcile a bank statement with a batch payment.](australia/payroll-reconciliation.png)

### Impact on accounting

Depending on the employee and contract configuration, the journal entry
linked to a payslip will be more or less exhaustive.

::: example
For instance, here is the journal entry generated by the employee Marcus
Cook configured above.

![Example of a journal entry for a payslip](australia/payroll-accounting-entry.png)
:::

Once posted, predefined accounts will impact the company\'s balance
sheet (PAYGW, wages, and superannuation liabilities) and profit & loss
report (wages and superannuation expenses). In addition, the employee\'s
gross wage and PAYG withholding will update the BAS report for the
relevant period (see Tax Grid: W1 and W2). Accounts can be adjusted to
the company\'s chart of accounts.

![Example of a BAS report PAYG tax witheld section.](australia/payroll-bas.png)

## Other payroll flows

### Paying super contributions

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo has a partnership with a clearing house to process both
superannuation payments and data to the right funds in one click, via
direct debit. Odoo is currently in the process of becoming compliant
with SuperStream, and an announcement will be made as soon as
superannuation contributions can be processed via Odoo\'s payroll
solution.
::::

Once a quarter (or more frequently, in preparation for [Payday
Super](https://www.ato.gov.au/about-ato/new-legislation/in-detail/superannuation/payday-superannuation)),
you have to process superannuation payments to your employees\' super
funds. To do so, go to
`Payroll --> Reporting --> Super Contributions`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![Example of a super file.](australia/payroll-superfile.png)

When ready to pay, add the `Bank Journal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} that will be used to pay the super from, then click
`Lock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to prevent the contributions
from subsequent payslips from being added to that file. Instead, a new
Super file will be created.

Once the payment has been processed, it can be traced back to the Super
file and matched with a bank statement.

![Example of a super file payment.](australia/payroll-superfile-payment.png)

### Terminating employees

Employees can be terminated by going to
`Payroll --> Reporting --> Terminate
Employee`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

The following fields must be completed:

- `Contract End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: once the
  termination is validated, this date will be added to the contract
  automatically, and mark the contract as `Expired`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} when the date has been reached.
- `Cessation Type Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a mandatory
  field for the ATO\'s STP reporting.
- `Termination Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the type of
  redundancy (genuine or non-genuine) affects the computation of unused
  annual and long service leave withholding.

![Terminating the contract of an employee.](australia/payroll-termination.png)

The balance of unused annual leaves and long service leaves is displayed
for reference.

Confirming the termination creates an out-of-cycle payslip with the tag
`final pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. It computes the worked
days until the contract end date, in addition to the employee\'s unused
annual and long service leave entitlements.

![Example of an out-of-cycle payslip of a terminated employee.](australia/payroll-termination-payslip.png)

Odoo automatically computes unused leave entitlements based on the
employee\'s current hourly rate leave loading (for annual leaves only),
and the remaining leave balance. However, these amounts can be manually
edited in the `Other Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} table if
necessary.

Employment Termination Payments (ETP) can also be added to the
`Other Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} table. Odoo has a
comprehensive list of excluded and non-excluded ETPs for companies to
select from.

### Switching from another STP software to Odoo

When switching from another STP-enabled software to Odoo, you might need
to maintain the continuity in the YTD values of your employees. Odoo
allows importing employees\' YTD values by going to
`Payroll --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and clicking `Import YTD
Balances`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Import YTD balances button.](australia/payroll-ytd-button.png)

For the ATO to recognize the employee records of your previous software
and keep a continuity in Odoo, you must enter the:

- `Previous BMS ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (one per
  database)
- `Previous Payroll ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (one per
  employee)

Ask your previous software provider if you cannot find its BMS ID or
your employees\' payroll IDs.

![Importing YTD balances.](australia/payroll-ytd-import.png)

This will give you the opportunity to add your employees\' YTD opening
balances in the current fiscal year. The ATO reports on a lot of
different types of YTD. These are represented by the 13 following
`Salary Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in Odoo.

![Salary rules for an employee.](australia/payroll-ytd-salary-rules.png)

::: example
Let us say that the employee Marcus Cook has been transitioned from
another STP-enabled software on September 1. Marcus has received two
monthly payslips in his previous software (for July and August). Here
are the YTD balances Marcus\'s company needs to transfer to Odoo:

  YTD category                YTD balance to transfer
  --------------------------- -------------------------
  Gross (normal attendance)   \$13,045.45
  Gross (overtime)            \$1,000
  Paid leave                  \$954.55
  Laundry allowance           \$200
  Total withholding           \$2,956
  Super Guarantee             \$1,610
:::

If some YTD balances need to be reported with more granularity to the
ATO, you can use the salary rule\'s inputs.

::: example
For instance, the *Basic Salary* rule can contain six inputs, and three
are necessary in our example: regular gross amounts, overtime, and paid
leaves. These are all reported differently in terms of YTD amounts.

![Adding YTD inputs](australia/payroll-ytd-basic-rule.png)

The finalized YTD opening balances for Marcus Cook look like the
following.

![Example of finalized YTD opening balances](australia/payroll-ytd-final.png)
:::

As a result, YTD computations on payslips are based on the employee\'s
opening balances instead of starting from zero.

### STP finalisation

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo is currently in the process of becoming compliant with STP Phase 2,
and the finalisation flows described below do not yet submit data to the
ATO.
::::

#### EOFY finalisation

Employers reporting through STP must make a finalization declaration by
14 July each year. To do so, go to
`Payroll --> Reporting --> STP Finalisation`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![EOFY finalisation of an employee.](australia/payroll-stp-eofy-finalisation.png)

Both active and terminated employees to finalise are displayed.

![List of employees to finalise.](australia/payroll-stp-eofy-list.png)

From the finalisation form view, you can proceed with a final audit of
all employees\' payslips during the relevant financial year. Once ready,
click `Submit to ATO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. When you have
made the finalisation declaration, employees will see the status of
their payment information change to `Tax ready`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on their online income statement after the end of the
financial year.

#### Individual finalisation

Odoo also allows you to finalise employees individually during the year.
This can be useful when:

- one-off payments are made after a first finalisation; and
- finalisation after termination of employment during the year.

To proceed with an individual finalisation, go to
`Payroll --> Reporting --> STP
Finalisation`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, leave the
`EOFY Declaration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox unticked,
and manually add employees to be finalised.

![Individual EOFY finalisation.](australia/payroll-stp-individual.png)

Even if you finalise an employee record partway through the financial
year, the ATO will not pre-fill the information into the employee\'s tax
return until after the end of the financial year.

### Adjustments

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo is currently in the process of becoming compliant with STP Phase 2,
and the adjustment flows described below do not yet submit data to the
ATO.
::::

#### Amend finalisation

If you need to amend YTD amounts for an employee after a finalisation
declaration was made, it is still possible to remove the finalisation
indicator for that employee. To do so, go to
`Payroll --> Reporting --> STP Finalisation`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select the employee, and leave the
`Finalisation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox unticked.

![Amending YTD amounts for an employee.](australia/payroll-stp-amend.png)

When ready, click `Submit to ATO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
file the finalisation update to the ATO.

Once the correct YTD details are ready for that employee after
amendment, finalise that employee again.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The ATO expects employers to correct errors within 14 days of detection
or, if your pay cycle is longer than 14 days (e.g., monthly), by the
date you would be due to lodge the next regular pay event. Finalisation
amendments can be done through STP up to five years after the end of the
financial year.
::::

Finalising and amending finalisation for a single employee can also be
useful when rehiring an employee within the same financial year.

#### Full file replacements

An employer can make full file replacements of pay runs to replace the
last lodgement sent to the ATO if it turns out to contain significantly
inaccurate data.

To do so, open the last STP submission and click
`Replace File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, select which
payslips need to be reset by ticking the
`Reset Payslip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

![Replace file button.](australia/payroll-stp-reset-payslips.png)

Resetting payslips does not create new payslips or a new pay run, but
instead:

- The payslips batch is reset from `Paid`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} or `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
  `Confirmed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- The status of the reset payslips revert back to
  `Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- The correct payslips remain paid and matched against the original
  payment.
- A new STP submission is created to replace the former one. For
  traceability purposes, the former STP submission is not deleted but
  marked as replaced.

First, correct the reset payslips and create their draft entry. Once
done, the `Submit to
ATO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} reappears on the payslip batch
to process the full file replacement.

![Resubmitting a payslip batch.](australia/payroll-stp-resubmit.png)

When ready, submit the pay run to the ATO once again. Please note that
full file replacements are only meant as a last resort to amend a
substantial amount of erroneous data. When possible, the ATO recommends
correcting an incorrect payslips by submitting a correction as part of
the next pay run or via update event.

Moreover, it is not possible to submit a second full file replacement of
the same submission, and a full file replacement can only be done once
every 24 hours.

#### Zero out YTD values

In case of a mid-year change of several key identifiers, YTD values need
to be zeroed out, and then re-posted with the updated key identifier.

For the following **company identifiers**, all employees need to be
zeroed out:

- ABN
- Branch Code
- BMS ID

For the following **employee identifiers**, only individual employees
can be zeroed out:

- TFN
- Payroll ID

1.  Before updating any key identifiers, create a new STP submission by
    going to
    `Payroll --> Reporting --> Single Touch Payroll`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and:

    - Change the `Submission Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
      `Update`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
    - Tick the `Zero Out YTD`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
      checkbox.
    - Click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to specify
      which employees.
    - Click `Submit to ATO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

    ![Creating a new STP submission to zero out YTD values.](australia/payroll-stp-zero-out.png)

2.  Once that is done, modify the key identifier(s) to amend.

3.  Finally, go back to
    `Payroll --> Reporting --> Single Touch Payroll`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} to create and submit a new
    `Update`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, this time without
    ticking the `Zero Out YTD`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    checkbox. This will notify the ATO that the previously recorded YTD
    balances are to be adjusted to the new key identifiers.

## Payroll links to other apps

### Time Off

The `Time Off app <../../../hr/time_off>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
is natively integrated with the Payroll app in Odoo. Different types of
leaves will populate payslips based on the concept of *work entries*.

Go to `Time Off --> Configuration --> Time Off Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and for each type, configure the following two
fields under the `Payroll`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section:

- `Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: defines which
  work entry should be selected on the `Worked
  Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} table of the payslip.
- `Unused Leave Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: choose between
  `Annual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Long Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Personal Leave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If
  `Personal Leave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, the
  remaining leave balance for this time off type will not show up as an
  entitlement at the time of termination. Unused leaves of the type
  `Annual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} will include leave loading
  if the employee is eligible for it.

![Configuring time off types.](australia/payroll-time-off.png)

### Expenses

The `Expenses app <../../../finance/expenses>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is also natively integrated with the **Payroll** app in
Odoo. First of all, go to
`Expenses --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and enable
`Reimburse in Payslip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

When an employee on your payroll submits an approved expense to be
reimbursed, you can reimburse them using two ways:

- If the expense is to be reimbursed outside of a pay run, click
  `Post Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The payment
  must be made manually.
- If the expense is to be reimbursed as part of the next pay run, click
  `Report in Next
  Payslip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} instead.

![Two ways of reimbursing an expense.](australia/payroll-expenses-reimburse.png)

After an expense has been added to the next payslip, you can find it in
the `Other Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} table. This input
type is then computed as an addition to the net salary.

![The expense reimbursement on a payslip.](australia/payroll-expenses-payslip.png)

After paying the employee, the payslip\'s journal item related to the
employee\'s reimbursement is automatically matched against the
expense\'s vendor bill.

![The payslip\'s journal item related to the employee\'s expense reimbursement.](australia/payroll-expenses-journal.png)

## Advanced configurations

### Other input types {#payroll/l10n_au/other-input-types}

You can access other input types by going to
`Payroll --> Configuration --> Other
Input Types`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. There are 63 other
input types related to Australia. We do not recommend using the other
ones as part of your payroll solution, since they cannot be used in the
frame of STP. You can archive or delete them.

On each input type, the following fields are important:

- `Payment Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} classifies input
  types in six categories:
  1.  `Allowance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a separate amount
      you pay to your employees in addition to salary and wages. Some of
      these allowances are mandated by modern awards: laundry,
      transport, etc.

      :::: important
      ::: title
      Important
      :::

      [Contact us](https://www.odoo.com/help) if you plan to use
      allowances subject to varied rates of withholding (such as *cents
      per KM* or *travel allowances*) to see whether Odoo currently
      covers your business case.
      ::::

      :::: note
      ::: title
      Note
      :::

      \- As of Odoo 18, some allowances such as
      `Laundry: Allowance for approved
      uniforms`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are managed by two
      other inputs: one to lodge the amount paid up to the ATO limit,
      and the other one to lodge the amount exceeding the ATO limit.
      This is necessary for Odoo to compute PAYGW correctly.
      \- Some businesses may require to shift the reporting of an
      allowance from `OTE`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
      `Salary & Wages`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} depending on
      the employee. In this case, you must duplicate and re-configure an
      existing other input type. For example, `Work-Related
      Non-Expense`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} allowance is
      `OTE`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} by default.
      ::::

  2.  `Deduction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: union fees and
      child support deductions are considered deductions.

  3.  `ETP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: employment termination
      payments. These are either considered excluded or non-excluded
      (see [ATO\'s web page on ETP components
      taxation](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/jobs-and-employment-types/working-as-an-employee/leaving-your-job/employment-termination-payments-for-employees/how-etp-components-are-taxed)).

  4.  `Leave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: leave-related other
      inputs that are not pertaining to a single pay period (lump sum,
      cashing out leaves while in service, unused leaves, etc.).

  5.  `Lump Sum`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: return to work and
      lump sum E (for back payments) fall under this category.

  6.  `Other`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: other payments with
      their own specific logic.
- `PAYGW Treatment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} affects how Odoo
  withholds tax for this input type: `Regular`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `No PAYG Withholding`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, and `Excess Only`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  (for allowances).
- `Superannuation Treatment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `OTE`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Salary & Wages`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Not Salary & Wages`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `STP Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: only visible in
  `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, this
  field tells Odoo how to report the gross value of this payment to the
  ATO. We do not recommend changing the value of this field if it was
  already set by default.

Grouping other input types by `Payment Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} can help you understand the different scenarios in
which these inputs can be used.

![Other input types grouped by payment type.](australia/payroll-other-input-types.png)

### Work entry types {#payroll/l10n_au/work-entry-types}

A *work entry type* is a type of attendance for employees (e.g.,
attendance, paid leave, overtime, etc.). A few work entry types are
created by default in every Australian database.

![Default work entry types for the Australian localization.](australia/payroll-work-entry-types.png)

Before using Odoo\'s payroll solution for Australia, it is recommended
you trim work entry types to keep the ones you need only by going to
`Payroll --> Configuration --> Work Entry
Types`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}

For each type, make sure to configure the following fields for
Australia:

- `Is OTE`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: determines whether time
  spent in this category can be considered ordinary time earnings,
  meaning that the superannuation guarantee rate will apply (e.g.,
  regular attendance, paid leave, etc.).
- `Penalty Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: used to determine
  the percentage of penalty that applies to time spent in this category.
  It is important that you configure the penalty rate that applies in
  your state or industry according to the type of work (e.g., Saturday
  rate, Sunday rate, overtime rate, etc.).
- `STP Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: only visible in
  `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, this
  field tells Odoo how to report the time spent in this category to the
  ATO. We do not recommend changing the value of this field if it was
  already set by default.

![Configuring a work entry type.](australia/payroll-work-entry-types-configuration.png)

## Current limitations

As of Odoo 18, we do not recommend companies to use the Payroll app for
the following business flows:

- Income stream types: Foreign Employment Income
- Tax treatment category: actors & performers
- Death benefits reporting
- Reporting obligations for WPN (instead of ABN)
- Allowances subject to a varied rate of withholding (such as *cents per
  kilometer* allowance and *travel allowances*)

[Contact us](https://www.odoo.com/help) if you would like to make sure
whether Odoo fits your payroll requirements in Australia.

## Employment Hero integration {#payroll/l10n_au/employment-hero}

If your business is already up and running with Employment Hero, you can
use the connector as an alternative payroll solution. The Employment
Hero module synchronizes payslip accounting entries (e.g., expenses,
social charges, liabilities, taxes) automatically from Employment Hero
to Odoo. Payroll administration is still done in Employment Hero; Odoo
only records the journal entries.

### Configuration

1.  `Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
    Employment Hero Payroll module ([l10n_employment_hero]{.title-ref}).

2.  Configure the Employment Hero API by going to
    `Accounting --> Configuration -->
    Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. More fields
    become visible after ticking the `Enable Employment Hero
    Integration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

    ![Enabling the Employment Hero integration.](australia/payroll-employment-hero-settings.png)

    - Find the `API Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
      `My Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
      Employment Hero platform.

      ![Finding the Employment Hero API key under the My Account section.](australia/payroll-employment-hero-api-key.png)

    - The `Payroll URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is pre-filled
      with [https://keypay.yourpayroll.com.au]{.title-ref}.

      :::: warning
      ::: title
      Warning
      :::

      Do not change the pre-filled `Payroll URL`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"}.
      ::::

    - Find the `Business Id`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
      Employment Hero URL (e.g., [189241]{.title-ref}).

      ![Finding the Employment Hero Business ID in the URL.](australia/payroll-employment-hero-business-id.png)

    - Select any Odoo journal as the `Payroll Journal`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"} to post the payslip entries.

3.  Configure the tax by going to
    `Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}. Create the necessary taxes for the Employment
    Hero payslip entries. Fill in the tax code from Employment Hero in
    the `Matching Employment Hero Tax`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} field.

### The API explained

The API syncs the journal entries from Employment Hero to Odoo and
leaves them in draft mode. The reference includes the Employment Hero
payslip entry ID in brackets for the user to easily retrieve the same
record in Employment Hero and Odoo.

![Employment Hero journal entries in Odoo.](australia/payroll-employment-hero-journal.png)

By default, the synchronization happens once per week. It is possible to
fetch the records manually by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and, in the `Employment Hero`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, clicking `Fetch Payruns Manually`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Employment Hero payslip entries also work based on double-entry
bookkeeping. The accounts used by Employment Hero are defined in the
Payroll settings section.

![Finding the Employment Hero accounts.](australia/payroll-employment-hero-accounts.png)

For the API to work, you must create the same accounts as the default
accounts of your Employment Hero business (same name and same code) in
Odoo. You also need to choose the correct account types in Odoo to
generate accurate financial reports.

# Belgium

## Understanding the Belgian payslip {#payroll/l10n_be/payslip_explained}

### Overview

Providing employees with a clear, transparent payslip is essential for
compliance and employee satisfaction. This guide explains how to
interpret a Belgian payslip, detailing key components that impact salary
calculations and deductions.

### General information

The first section of the payslip contains the employee\'s general
details. It is crucial to verify the accuracy of the civil status and
the number of dependents, as these factors influence tax calculations.
Employers can ensure updates are made through their internal salary
configurator or employee profile management systems.

![How to read a payslip - General Information.](belgium/payslip-explained-01.png)

### Work entries

This section outlines time-off applications and their impact on salary.
The base salary typically remains constant unless unpaid leave is taken.
If an employee has taken unpaid leave, parental leave, or any unexpected
absence, their salary will reflect the corresponding deductions.

![How to read a payslip - Work Entries.](belgium/payslip-explained-02.png)

### Payroll calculation

The core of the payslip details various salary components, deductions,
and benefits. Below are the primary elements:

- **Benefits in Kind**: If applicable, benefits in kind (such as a
  mobile or internet subscription or a laptop) are subject to taxation
  and impact net remuneration.

  When a company car is provided for personal use, a taxable benefit
  (ATN) is added to the employee\'s salary. This is determined by:

  - The catalog value and age of the vehicle
  - The vehicle\'s CO2 emissions

  This benefit is subject to withholding tax and will be adjusted later
  in the payroll process.

- **Social Security contributions**: A mandatory 13.07% deduction from
  gross salary is allocated to the National Social Security Office
  (ONSS). This includes:

  - Pensions: 7.5%
  - Health Insurance for Care: 3.55%
  - Health Insurance for Benefits: 1.15%
  - Unemployment: 0.87%

  Additionally, the employer contributes on average 25% of the
  employer\'s contributions to the National Social Security Office.

- **Employment bonus**: A reduction in employee contributions based on
  gross salary, which is phased out if the salary exceeds a specific
  threshold.

  ::: seealso
  [More info on job
  bonuses](https://www.socialsecurity.be/employer/instructions/dmfa/fr/latest/instructions/deductions/workers_reductions/workbonus.html)
  :::

- **Withholding taxes**: Withholding tax rates are revised annually by
  the [SPF
  Finances](https://finances.belgium.be/fr/entreprises/personnel_et_remuneration/precompte_professionnel/calcul).

  The tax amount is influenced by:

  - Gross salary
  - Marital status (married, legally cohabiting, or single)
  - Household composition (children or other dependents)

  This serves as an advance payment on professional income tax.

- **Reduction in withholding tax**: A reduction based on gross salary,
  which is ignored if salary surpasses a specific amount.

- **Special Social Security contribution**: A household income-based tax
  applicable to all employees covered by social security.

- **Meal voucher deduction**: Employees receive meal vouchers valued for
  instance at €8 per workday, where:

  - The employer contributes €6.91
  - The employee contributes €1.09

  ::: example
  - 5 worked days -\> deduction of €5.45 ($5\times\text{€}1.09$)
  - 22 worked days -\> deduction of €23.98 ($22\times\text{€}1.09$)
  :::

  Variations in this deduction impact monthly net salary.

- **Representation fees**: An optional net salary component, allocated
  in two parts:

  - A fixed portion, independent of working hours
  - A prorated portion, adjusted for part-time schedules

- **Net salary**: The final amount deposited into the employee\'s bank
  account after deductions.

## December pay {#payroll/l10n_be/december_pay}

### Why a December settlement?

An employer must pay a vacation allowance to an employee in December
under two conditions:

- If the employee has reduced their working hours during the vacation
  year.
- If the employee is unable to take all their vacation days before the
  end of the year.

In principle, employers must ensure that employees take their annual
vacation before December 31. However, certain circumstances may prevent
employees from using all their vacation days. In these cases, the
employer must pay the simple vacation allowance for unused days before
the end of the year. Additionally, if the employee has not received the
double vacation allowance earlier in the year (typically in May or
June), they are entitled to receive it.

### Reduction of working hours

When an employee reduces their average working hours with the same
employer, the employer must pay the vacation allowance in December of
the year in which the reduction occurs, as if the employee had left the
company.

**Possible scenarios**:

- Transition to part-time work.
- Partial career break.
- Thematic leave on a part-time basis.
- Partial return to work after a full incapacity period.

The settlement is calculated based on the previous vacation year\'s
earnings and includes:

- **Simple vacation allowance**: 7.67% of the yearly gross salary from
  the previous year, including any fictitious salary for assimilated
  interruption days, minus the simple vacation allowance already paid
  during the vacation year.
- **Double vacation allowance**: 7.67% of the yearly gross salary from
  the previous year, including any fictitious salary for assimilated
  interruption days, minus the double vacation allowance already paid
  during the vacation year.

If all vacation days have been taken before the reduction in working
hours, no additional calculation is required.

### Inability to use vacation days

As a general rule, all vacation days must be used within the vacation
year. However, if an employee is unable to take all their vacation due
to force majeure or specific suspension reasons, the employer must pay
the following by December 31:

- **Simple vacation allowance** for unused days, based on the December
  salary.
- **Double vacation allowance** if it has not yet been paid, based on
  the December salary.

**Eligible reasons include**:

- Common illness or accident.
- Work accident or occupational disease.
- Maternity leave, paternity leave (converted maternity leave),
  prophylactic leave.
- Birth, adoption, or reception leave.
- Parental leave or protective maternity leave measures.

#### New rule (effective end of 2024)

Employees unable to take vacation due to the above reasons (except force
majeure or protective maternity leave measures) can carry over unused
days for up to 24 months. Since the vacation allowance is already paid
in December of the vacation year, no additional payment will be made
when the carried-over days are used.

### Employer payment responsibilities

The employer must pay any outstanding simple vacation allowance based on
7.67% of the gross salary from the previous year. However, an exit
vacation allowance based on the current year\'s gross salary is not due.

If an employee reduces their working hours and continues in the same
role the following year, an additional vacation allowance calculation
may be required in December.

### Example calculation

1.  In 2013, an employee works full-time (5 days per week).
2.  In 2014, the employee works full-time until June 30, then switches
    to part-time (5 half-days per week).
3.  The employee takes vacation in August 2014 under the new part-time
    regime (20 half-days over 4 weeks).
4.  They receive a simple vacation allowance for 20 half-days and a
    double vacation allowance equivalent to 92% of their monthly salary.
5.  In December 2014, the employee receives additional simple (7.67%)
    and double (7.67%) vacation allowances based on 2013\'s gross
    salary, minus previously paid amounts.
6.  In 2015, if the employee continues part-time, they receive vacation
    based on part-time hours plus 5 full-time vacation days from the
    2014 vacation year.
7.  A second settlement in December 2015 includes additional simple
    (7.67%) and double (7.67%) vacation allowances based on the 2014
    gross salary, minus previously paid amounts.

### How to do it in Odoo

On a classic `payslip <../payslips>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
issued in December, press the `Compute December
Holiday Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to open a
configuration wizard.

Based on the allocated and requested time off, the
`Simple Holiday Pay N-1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Double Holiday Pay N-1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
December payslip are computed (and editable for manual encoding). Click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm.

![December Pay Amount.](belgium/december-pay-02.png)

After validation, two additional inputs are stored on the payslip, and
the payslip is re-computed to take those new remunerations into account.

The simple holiday pay is included into the gross remuneration.

![December Pay Simple.](belgium/december-pay-04.png)

The double holiday pay is computed separately and included into the net
amount.

## Departure: holiday attests {#payroll/l10n_be/holiday_attests}

### Overview

In Belgium, when an employee leaves a company, the employer is required
to provide vacation attestations. These documents help the new employer
determine the employee\'s vacation entitlements and any vacation pay
due. Odoo facilitates the automatic generation of these attestations
based on payroll and time-off data.

### Types of attestations

Odoo generates two types of vacation attestations:

1.  **For the previous year (N-1)**: If the employee has not yet taken
    all the vacation days from the previous year.
2.  **For the current year (N)**: Covering the vacation rights accrued
    in the year of departure.

Each attestation includes details such as:

- The period the employee was employed.
- Agreed working time and any modifications.
- Gross amounts of single and double vacation pay paid.
- Social security contributions paid by the employer.
- Number of vacation days already taken.
- Additional (European) vacation pay and days.

### Calculation logic in Odoo

Odoo computes the attestations based on payroll and leave data. The main
calculations include:

1.  **Retrieving payroll and leave records**
    - The system identifies the employee\'s payroll records for the
      current and previous years.
    - It retrieves validated leave requests and allocations.
2.  **Computing gross remuneration**
    - The gross annual salary for both the current and previous years is
      computed from payroll records.
    - The average monthly salary is calculated for unpaid leave
      adjustments.
3.  **Time-off calculations**
    - The number of vacation days taken and allocated in the current
      year is determined.
    - Unpaid leave days are accounted for separately.
4.  **Fictitious remuneration calculation**
    - If unpaid leave was taken, Odoo computes a fictitious remuneration
      adjustment using the formula:

      [$$\text{Fictitious Remuneration} = (\text{Unpaid Leave Days} \times
      \text{Average Monthly Salary} \times 3) \div (13 \times 5)$$]{.overflow-scroll}
5.  **Generating the final attestation**
    - Odoo creates a payroll entry reflecting the vacation pay due.
    - The attestation document is generated and can be printed or
      exported.

Two payslips are created:

1.  **Payslip for the current year**
    ([termination_payslip_n]{.title-ref})

    This payslip covers the employee\'s last salary period in the year
    of termination.

2.  **Payslip for the previous year**
    ([termination_payslip_n1]{.title-ref})

    The one accounts the amount of money converted from the untaken time
    off of previous year.

Each payslip is generated using the appropriate payroll structure,
ensuring correct calculations for all entitlements and deductions.

Before computing the final payment, the system gathers necessary payroll
data:

1.  **Annual gross salary calculation**

    To estimate the employee\'s **annual gross salary**, the system
    looks for the most recent validated monthly payslip. If a payslip is
    found, the **gross salary** from that payslip is multiplied by 12 to
    get an annual estimate. If no payslip exists, the annual gross
    salary is set to **zero**.

2.  **European leave recovery**

    The system retrieves all **European leave days (LEAVE216)** taken by
    the employee during the current year. It then calculates the **total
    amount paid for these leaves** and determines how much should be
    deducted.

    The deduction follows these principles:

    - If an employee has taken **European holidays (additional vacation
      days)**, the amount paid in advance must be recovered.
    - The recovery is either:
      - Deducted from **the double vacation pay (85%)** for the next
        year.
      - Or, if the employee leaves, deducted from the final termination
        payslip.
    - If leave has been taken, the **termination certificate** must
      specify:
      - The **number of European leave days** already granted.
      - The **gross allowance** corresponding to these days.

    To ensure fairness, the system first checks whether a deduction has
    already been applied in the **double vacation pay**. If so, only the
    remaining amount is deducted from the final payslip.

    Once the required values are determined, they are recorded in the
    payslip as **additional payroll inputs**:

    - **Gross salary reference**: Includes the final salary amount plus
      any fictitious remuneration.
    - **European leave deduction**: Deducts the previously paid European
      leave amounts.
    - **Other inputs**: Allocates time off taken, taxable amounts, and
      any outstanding allocations.

    After setting these values, the system **computes the payslip** to
    ensure all deductions and payments are correctly applied.

    This process ensures that the final **termination payslip** takes
    into account all salary components, including **annual gross pay,
    European leave recovery, and any unpaid entitlements**. Odoo
    retrieves past payslips and time-off records to ensure compliance
    with **Belgian payroll regulations**.

By automating this process, Odoo minimizes manual intervention, reducing
errors and ensuring employees receive the correct termination payments.

### How does it work in Odoo?

In Odoo, to access the holiday attests process, go to the employee form
view and click on `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Action)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} then
`Departure: Holiday Attests`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
navigate to
`Payroll --> Reporting --> Departure: Holiday Attests`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

In the wizard that appears, you can see all the payslips over the
current and last year, the time off requests and allocations. You can
also encode the unpaid time off you would like to declare on that
holiday attest.

Once you\'re ready, click the
`Validate & Compute holiday attests`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button. Two payslips are generated for each considered period (N and
N-1).

Once validated, two `.pdf`{.interpreted-text role="file"} documents are
generated. One **classic payslip** and one **holiday attests** for the
future employer.

::: example

## Departure: notice period & termination fees {#belgium_payroll/notice_period}

This documentation explains how the employee departure process works in
the application, focusing on the notice period calculation and severance
pay when the employee does not serve their notice period.

### Overview

This module helps manage employee departures by determining the correct
notice period based on seniority, departure reasons, and specific
country regulations (Belgium). It also calculates severance pay when the
employee does not work during their notice period.

### Key features

- Automatic calculation of notice period start and end dates.
- Consideration of public holidays and company-specific schedules.
- Calculation of severance pay based on company policies and government
  rules.
- Generation of a final payslip including termination fees.

### Notice period calculation

The notice period depends on several factors:

- The employee\'s seniority in the company.
- The reason for departure (resignation, dismissal, retirement, etc.).
- Whether the employee works during the notice period or not.
- The salary level before January 1, 2014 (for some cases).

The notice period starts on the first Monday after the departure date
unless a specific rule applies (e.g., a mandatory waiting period of
three days for certain dismissals).

### Notice duration rules

The following table shows the duration of the notice period based on the
length of service:

#### For resigned employees

  ---------------------------------------------
  Seniority (months)    Notice Period (weeks)
  --------------------- -----------------------

  288+                  66+
  ---------------------------------------------

### Special case: employees hired before 2014

For employees who started before January 1, 2014, the notice period
calculation is divided into two parts:

#### Part 1: Seniority acquired before December 31, 2013

- **Lower-level employees** (annual gross salary ≤ €32,254): The notice
  period is 3 months for the first 5 years of seniority, increasing by
  1.5 months per additional year.
- **Higher-level employees** (annual gross salary \> €32,254): The
  notice period is 1 month per started year of seniority, with a minimum
  of 3 months.

#### Part 2: Seniority acquired from January 1, 2014 onwards

The standard notice period rules from 2014 apply to seniority acquired
after this date.

The total notice period is the sum of both periods calculated
separately.

### Severance pay calculation

If an employee does not serve their notice period, severance pay is
calculated based on:

- The remaining notice duration.
- The employee\'s last salary.
- Additional compensation such as bonuses, stock options, and insurance
  contributions.

The severance pay consists of:

- The current salary, which corresponds either to the full notice period
  that should normally be observed or the remaining part of it.
- Benefits acquired during the contract (e.g., meal vouchers, company
  car, mobile phone usage).

The current salary is determined as follows:

- The employee\'s gross monthly salary at the time of dismissal.
- All recurring bonuses, except for one-time bonuses (e.g., team work
  bonus, seniority bonus).
- Additional compensation for overtime hours worked over a longer
  period.
- Variable salary (average over the last twelve months).

The system automatically generates a termination payslip including these
calculations, ensuring compliance with Belgian labor laws.

### How does it work in Odoo?

In Odoo, to access the departure process, go to the employee form view
and click on `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Action)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} then
`Departure: Notice Period and payslip`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or navigate to
`Payroll --> Reporting --> Departure: Notice Period`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

In the wizard that appears, select the reason for departure, provide a
description of the departure, and specify the dismissal date. The
employee\'s seniority is calculated based on their contract history, and
the notice period is determined accordingly. You can also indicate
whether the employee will be working during the notice period.

![Departure Notice Wizard.](belgium/departure-notice-02.png)

If the employee is working during the notice period, there are no
termination fees to calculate, and the notice period will be recorded on
the employee\'s form. Click the `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

### Conclusion

This module simplifies the departure process by providing clear and
automatic calculations for the notice period and severance pay. It helps
HR teams ensure compliance and streamline the exit process for
employees.

## DIMONA {#payroll/l10n_be/dimona}

### What is the Dimona?

#### Obligation

All employers, both in the public and private sectors, are required to
electronically communicate the entry and exit of their personnel to the
National Social Security Office (Royal Decree of November 5, 2002).

This involves the immediate declaration of employment, also known as
DIMONA (Déclaration Immédiate -Onmiddellijke Aangifte). Its purpose is
to immediately notify social security institutions of the beginning and
end of an employment relationship between the worker and the employer.

The declarations submitted by the employer and immediately checked by
the NSSO feed into a database called the *personnel file*. The employer
can access it in a secure environment. There are numerous search
criteria: they can be based on characteristics and combinations of
characteristics.

Failure to comply with this reporting obligation may result in criminal
penalties as provided for in Article 181 of the Social Penal Code.

Furthermore, in case of omission of declaration, the employer will owe
the NSSO a solidarity contribution.

#### Concept and terminology

##### Employer-worker relationship

The relationship between the \"employer\" and the \"worker\" couple.
This relationship includes stable data (employer identification number,
worker\'s national identification social security number (NISS), start
date of the relationship, and optionally end date), which will be
maintained even in case of creation, closure, modification, or
cancellation of a period. This relationship begins with the worker\'s
first engagement and ends at the end of their last occupation. In the
personnel file, \"employer-worker\" relationships constitute the first
level of consultation. The second level encompasses all Dimona periods;

##### Dimona period

A period is created with each IN declaration, thus at the beginning of
each new occupation. It is closed by an exit date at the end of each
occupation. The employer-worker relationship, on the other hand, is
maintained until the end of the last occupation. Several Dimona periods
may or may not succeed each other within the same employer-worker
relationship.

Any changes generated by an OUT declaration, a modification (UPDATE), or
a cancellation (CANCEL) occur at this second level.

This Dimona period is identified by a \"period identification number\".
It is assigned to each IN declaration and constitutes the unique
identification key of a period for submitting OUT, modification, or
cancellation declarations.

##### Dimona number

A unique number assigned by the NSSO to each Dimona declaration (IN,
OUT, UPDATE, CANCEL,\...). For an IN declaration, it is the period
identification number. When declarations are submitted via file
transfer, multiple Dimona numbers are created: one number per employment
relationship included in the structured message;

##### Dimona characteristics

Mandatory data of a Dimona declaration. There are four: the industry
sector number, worker type, sub-entity (reserved for certain public
sector employers), and user (for temporary workers). Characteristics are
always linked to a period. In case of different characteristics,
multiple periods can coexist;

##### Receipt confirmation

Confirms for web users that the declaration has been received (appears
immediately on the screen);

##### Receipt acknowledgment

Electronic message for batch senders indicating whether the file is
usable for the NSSO. This \"receipt acknowledgment\" contains the ticket
number (`file identification number`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}) and
the file status: accepted or rejected depending on whether the file is
readable or not;

##### Notification

Electronic message with feedback on the processing of the declaration.
The notification is the immediate result of form and content checks. It
can be of three types: positive (Dimona accepted), negative (Dimona
rejected), or provisional (only in case of problems with worker
identification). The provisional notification will always be followed by
a positive or negative notification.

For the declaration of students under a student contract (STU), the
notification will also contain a warning if the student is declared for
more than 475 hours. If the declaration was made via a secure channel,
the exact number of days of excess will be communicated.

For the daily declaration of occasional workers in the hospitality
industry, the notification will also contain a warning if the worker is
declared for more than 50 days and/or for the employer quota, if more
than 100 days of occasional work have been declared.

Once you have received this notification, you have five working days to
contest the accuracy of the data mentioned therein. At the end of this
period, these data will be considered final. For any disputes, you must
contact the Eranova Contact Center (tel: 02 511 51 51, email:
<contactcenter@eranova.fgov.be>).

Note that if the employer is affiliated with an approved social
secretariat or a full-service secretariat, they may not receive any
notification. In this case, notifications are electronically transmitted
to the social secretariat or full-service secretariat, even for
declarations that the employer has submitted personally. However, the
employer has access to the personnel file, where they can view all data.

#### Channels

The Dimona declaration must be submitted in the form of an electronic
message via one of the following channels:

- web
- personnel file
- file transfer
- web service (REST)
- Dimona Mobile

The choice of one channel over another has no impact on the declaration.
Therefore, you can freely choose the channel you will use.

Any declaration modifications can also be made through any of these four
channels. The channel through which the original declaration was
submitted plays no role.

A Dimona declaration cannot be submitted via SMS.

### Dimona in Odoo

#### Manual

In Odoo, when you have the Belgian Payroll Localization installed, as
soon as you have a contract set to the running stage, it creates an
activity for the HR responsible that they need to introduce the Dimona
for today with the correct link to the Dimona Platform (the web channel
mentioned in the Channels section of this article).

![Dimona Activity.](belgium/dimona-01.png)

#### Automated

In Odoo, when you have the Belgian Payroll Localization installed, it is
also possible to install the module Belgium - Payroll - Dimona. This
module will allow you to perform the 4 main actions needed in the Dimona
(as seen in Section 1 of this article):

1.  Open the dimona
2.  Update the dimona
3.  Close the dimona
4.  Cancel the Dimona

These actions answer the different use case explained in Section 1.

##### Contract and employee data

Basically, it checks the contract and employee data needed to create,
update, close or cancel.

##### Error handling

If some information is missing or wrongly configured, the system will
return errors and you can take corrective action in order to make sure
your Dimona is correctly sent, updated, closed or canceled.

##### Synchronization status

The status of sync and errors are shown in the chatter of the contract.

##### Scheduled action

Finally, the cron checks every day, for all contracts that have the
status dimona waiting and triggers the necessary actions to update the
dimona status accordingly.

##### Technical configuration (outside Odoo)

Regarding the technical configuration, everything is described in the
module information with all the technical prerequisites. If your
customer or partner need further assistance with that, they need to
contact their IT department or representatives as this is not part of
Odoo configuration.

##### Functional configuration (within Odoo)

From the Odoo configuration point of view, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration
--> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and in the
`Belgian Localization`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section for
`ONSS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, configure the following:

- `ONSS Company ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: VAT Number of
  the Company
- `Registration Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: 9 digits
  code received from the NSSO (ONSS - RSZ)
- `DMFA Employer Class`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: 3 digits
  code received from the NSSO (ONSS - RSZ)
- `Expeditor Number ONSS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Not
  Mandatory (see technical documentation of the module for more
  information)
- `PEM Certificate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `PEM Passphare`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `KEY file`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: check the module
  information for explanation

## DmfA - Multifunctional Declaration {#payroll/l10n_be/dmfa}

### Overview

DmfA stands for \"Déclaration Multifonctionnelle\" or \"Multifunctionele
Aangifte.\" It has replaced the quarterly ONSS declaration since the
first quarter of 2003. Through this declaration, employers submit salary
and working time data for their employees.

These data are processed in a way that allows all social security
institutions to work with the same information. The declaration is
called \"multifunctional\" because it is used not only for social
security contribution calculations and reductions but also as a data
source for institutions managing social security rights and benefits.

Sectors utilizing DmfA data include:

- Health insurance
- Unemployment benefits
- Pensions
- Occupational risks (Fedris)
- Family allowances
- Annual leave

All employers registered with ONSS must submit a DmfA declaration.

### Relationship with Dimona and DRS

DmfA is closely linked to two other mandatory declarations:

#### Dimona (immediate declaration)

Dimona records the start and end of an employment relationship with an
employee.

#### DRS (social risks declaration)

During an employment relationship, various social risks may arise, such
as termination, workplace accidents, or long-term illness. When a social
risk occurs, social security institutions require additional information
beyond that provided by DmfA and Dimona.

DRS is now primarily an electronic declaration, though paper submissions
remain possible.

### Who submits the DmfA declaration?

#### Self-declaration options

Employers can submit their DmfA declaration themselves via:

1.  **Web Submission:** Suitable for employers with a small workforce.
    Declarations are entered directly through the social security
    portal.
2.  **Batch Submission:** Designed for large employers or organizations
    handling multiple declarations (e.g., social secretariats, payroll
    software providers). Declarations are submitted via file transfer
    (FTP, SFTP, etc.).

#### Advantages of web submission

- **Automatic access to the company\'s employee list**: Based on Dimona
  data. If an employee is missing, they must first be declared via
  Dimona. After 24 hours, the employee list is updated, allowing for an
  accurate DmfA submission.
- **Automatic calculation of net payable amount**: Once all required
  data is entered, the system calculates the total payable amount.
- **Reduction calculations**: The system calculates applicable
  reductions, except for reductions under code \"0001\" (personal
  contribution reductions for low-income workers). Employers need to
  check the relevant boxes and, if necessary, provide additional
  details.

#### Advantages of batch submission

- **Submission of large volumes of declarations**: Ideal for
  organizations managing multiple payrolls.
- **Quick response on acceptance status**: Employers receive immediate
  feedback on whether their declaration has been accepted.
- **Error reporting**: The system generates a report on detected
  anomalies, regardless of acceptance status.
- **Automatic correction of calculation errors**: When possible, errors
  are corrected automatically, and employers are notified of
  adjustments.

### Third-Party submission options

Employers who do not wish to submit the DmfA themselves can delegate the
task to:

1.  **Accredited Social Secretariats**: These organizations handle
    payroll and declaration tasks on behalf of employers.
2.  **Service Providers**: These may be companies or individuals with
    whom the employer has a contractual agreement to manage payroll
    declarations securely.

For more information on accredited social secretariats or service
providers, please refer to the relevant [official DmfA
documentation](https://www.socialsecurity.be/site_fr/employer/applics/dmfa/index.htm).

### Configuration

The declaration is generated under
`Payroll app --> Reporting --> Belgium --> DmfA`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} as is supposed to work properly after several
required configuration steps.

#### Company

To generate a valid DmfA declaration, specific company and
employer-related information is required, (under
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}). These include:

- `ONSS Company ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `ONSS Registration Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `DMFA Employer Class`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `ONSS Certificate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: certificate for
  signature file generation (required for batch declarations)
- VAT `Company Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Revenue Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `FFE Employer Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (Fonds de
  Fermeture d\'Entreprise)

#### Employee

Additionally, each employee must be assigned to a valid working address,
identified with a DmfA code, in their employee record. This operating
unit must be linked to a valid ONSS identification number to ensure
compliance with declaration requirements. Failing to configure this
properly may result in errors during the declaration submission process.

On the employee form, the `Work Address`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} must be defined.

Under
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> DMFA: Work Locations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, you can link the work address to a ONSS
identification number.

![DmfA - Work Location ONSS ID.](belgium/dmfa-07.png)

#### Work entry type

A DmfA code should be defined for each work entry type that is declared.
Under
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Work Entries --> Work Entry Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, specify the `DMFA code`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

#### Potential configuration errors

During the declaration generation process, configuration issues may
arise, triggering errors such as:

- Terminated employees without or with invalid start/end notice period
- Invalid NISS number for some employees
- Work addresses not linked to an ONSS identification code
- Work entry type missing a corresponding DmfA code
- Other inconsistencies in employer or employee records

Employers should ensure accurate configuration to avoid delays and
rejection of their declarations.

#### Web declaration

![DmfA - Web Declaration.](belgium/dmfa-03.png)

A web declaration generates a PDF summarizing the company\'s general
information, as well as all employee data that must be manually entered
into the system. This includes:

For the company:

![DmfA - PDF Company.](belgium/dmfa-01.png)

#### Batch declaration

![DmfA - Web Declaration.](belgium/dmfa-05.png)

Batch declarations require technical knowledge, including SSH keys, SFTP
servers, and electronic signatures. Employers should refer to the
[official batch
documentation](https://www.socialsecurity.be/site_fr/employer/applics/dmfa/batch/home.htm)
and [process
overview](https://www.socialsecurity.be/site_fr/employer/applics/dmfa/batch/outline.htm).

A batch submission generates three files:

1.  **Declaration file** (e.g., FI.DMFA.112768.20250109.00014.R.1.1)
2.  **Launch file** (e.g., GO.DMFA.112768.20250109.00014.R.1)
3.  **Electronic signature file** (e.g.,
    FS.DMFA.112768.20250109.00014.R.1.1) (only for real declarations,
    not tests)

The full process includes creating, sending, validating, and potentially
correcting declarations. Rejections and anomalies must be addressed
before final acceptance.

![DmfA - Web Declaration.](belgium/dmfa-09.png)

1.  **Creation of the Declaration**
    - Create an XML document containing employee benefit data,
      remuneration, and contributions for the company.
    - More information on XML files can be found in the *Specifications*
      page.
2.  **Sending the Declaration**
    - Use FTP or SFTP for sending the file. Access requires prior
      authorization for secure zone access by a local manager.
    - Detailed instructions are available on the [Introduce and Modify
      (via batch)](https://www.socialsecurity.be).
3.  **File Acknowledgment Receipt**
    - **Positive Receipt**: Indicates the file can be processed.
      However, this does not guarantee acceptance.
    - **Negative Receipt**: Indicates issues with the file structure or
      access rights.
4.  **Notification and Ticket Number for the Declaration**
    - A positive notification is sent for each accepted declaration.
    - Negative notification: Provides information on encountered
      anomalies.
5.  **Sending PID**
    - Employers and SSA will receive PID and version numbers via batch
      for declarations.
6.  **Modification Notification with System Corrections**
    - If corrections are made, a modification notification is sent with
      corrected values.

## Double holiday pay {#payroll/l10n_be/double_holiday_pay}

Double holiday pay is an additional bonus paid to employees and workers
during their annual leave. The amount depends on the employee\'s or
worker\'s salary.

### How is double holiday pay calculated?

For employees, double holiday pay amounts to 92% of their gross salary
for the month when they take their main annual leave. This amount is
calculated based on the number of months worked or considered equivalent
in the previous year.

### Impact of additional or European leave

If you take additional or European leave, your employer will pay you
regular holiday pay for that leave. However, the following year, this
amount will be deducted from your double holiday pay. This is because
additional leave is considered an advance on the next year\'s legal
leave.

### Factors affecting the calculation

1.  **Months Worked**: The calculation is based on the number of months
    you worked in the previous year.
2.  **Absences**: If you had unpaid absences, they may reduce your
    double holiday pay.
3.  **Variable Revenues**: Bonuses and commissions earned in the
    previous year can impact the total amount of double holiday pay.
4.  **Withholding Taxes**: The double holiday pay is subject to income
    tax deductions, which depend on your annual earnings and family
    situation.

### Withholding tax calculation

The withholding tax is calculated using a progressive rate system. The
process involves:

1.  **Identify the Employee\'s Annual Taxable Revenue**:
    - Compute the annualized salary, including benefits in kind (e.g.,
      company car, internet, mobile phone, laptop).
    - Apply reductions for dependent children.
2.  **Apply Tax Rates**:
    - Use predefined tax brackets to determine the base withholding tax
      rate.
    - If applicable, apply a reduction based on the number of dependent
      children.

#### Tax brackets

The withholding tax is applied progressively based on the following
brackets (as of 2025):

  ------------------------------------------
  Lower Bound    Upper Bound    Tax Rate
  -------------- -------------- ------------
  0.00           10,415.00      0.00%

  10,415.01      13,330.00      19.17%

  13,330.01      16,960.00      21.20%

  16,960.01      20,340.00      26.25%

  20,340.01      23,020.00      31.30%

  23,020.01      25,710.00      34.33%

  25,710.01      31,070.00      36.34%

  31,070.01      33,810.00      39.37%

  33,810.01      44,770.00      42.39%

  44,770.01      58,460.00      47.44%

  58,460.00      ∞              53.50%
  ------------------------------------------

#### Tax exemption

A withholding tax exemption is granted when the normal annual gross
income does not exceed a specific threshold, which is determined based
on the number of dependent children \[2\].

A disabled dependent child counts as two.

The method involves referring to a two-column table:

- **Column 1**: Indicates the number of dependent children.
- **Column 2**: Specifies the maximum allowable normal annual gross
  income, based on the number of dependent children listed in Column 1,
  which must not be exceeded to qualify for full or partial exemption
  from withholding tax.

After determining the annual gross income, two scenarios may arise:

1.  If the annual income exceeds the threshold, no exemption is granted.
2.  If the annual income does not exceed the threshold, an exemption
    will be applied.

The amount of this exemption corresponds to the difference between the
annual gross income and the threshold amount.

Of course, if this difference exceeds the base withholding tax amount,
no withholding tax will be due.

  ------------------------------------------
  No. of Children   Max Revenue (EUR)
  ----------------- ------------------------
  1                 18,400.00

  2                 21,930.00

  3                 28,270.00

  4                 35,330.00

  5                 42,390.00

  6                 49,450.00

  7                 56,510.00

  8                 63,570.00

  9                 70,630.00

  10                77,690.00

  11                84,750.00

  12                91,810.00
  ------------------------------------------

#### Tax reductions

When there is no justification for fully or partially exempting the
exceptional allowance from withholding tax, it is still possible to
grant a reduction in withholding tax.

To determine eligibility for this reduction, one must check whether the
normal annual gross salary exceeds a certain higher threshold, which
varies according to the number of dependent children \[3\]. This
threshold is higher than the one used for exemption purposes.

A disabled child counts as two.

The method involves referring to a three-column table:

- **Column 1**: Indicates the number of dependent children (up to a
  maximum of 5).
- **Column 2**: Specifies the percentage reduction in withholding tax,
  based on the number of dependent children listed in Column 1, which
  must not be exceeded to qualify for the reduction.
- **Column 3**: Shows the threshold amount that must not be exceeded,
  corresponding to the number of dependent children listed in Column 1.

Two scenarios may arise:

1.  If the threshold amount is exceeded, no reduction will be granted.
2.  If the threshold amount is not exceeded, a reduction will be applied
    to the withholding tax amount, up to a percentage rate determined in
    Column 2.

For employees with dependent children, tax reductions apply as follows:

  -----------------------------------------------------
  No. of Children   Reduction (%)      Max Revenue
  ----------------- ------------------ ----------------
  1                 7.5%               28,245.00

  2                 20.0%              28,245.00

  3                 35.0%              31,070.00

  4                 55.0%              36,720.00

  5+                75.0%              39,550.00
  -----------------------------------------------------

#### Final tax calculation

The final withholding tax amount is:

[$$\text{Tax} = \text{Gross Double Holiday} \times \text{Applicable Tax Rate} -
\text{Reduction (if applicable)}$$]{.overflow-scroll}

The resulting tax is deducted from the gross double holiday salary to
determine the net amount payable to the employee.

The calculation considers work duration, absences, variable revenue, and
applicable withholding taxes. Odoo automates these calculations to
ensure compliance with Belgian labor laws and tax regulations.

helps in better financial planning for the holiday period.

## Eco vouchers {#payroll/l10n_be/eco_vouchers}

### Overview

Eco vouchers are a tax-free employee benefit designed to support the
purchase of environmentally-friendly products and services. These
vouchers are ordered via external providers and are exempt from social
security contributions.

### Eligibility & allocation

Employees who have worked during the **reference period (01/06/N-1 -
31/05/N)** are eligible for up to **250€** in eco vouchers, which are
granted at the beginning of **July**.

::: example
For 2025, employees must have worked between **01/06/2024 and
31/05/2025** to qualify.
:::

For employees who join during the reference period, the voucher amount
is prorated based on their worked days.

::: example
An employee hired on **06/01**, having worked **6 out of 12 months**,
would receive:

[$$250\text{€} \times (6/12) = 125\text{€}$$]{.overflow-scroll}
:::

For part-time employees, the amount is adjusted as follows:

  Work Regime   Voucher Amount (€)
  ------------- --------------------
  4/5           250€
  3/5           200€
  1/2           125€
  \< 1/2        100€

::: example
If an employee starts on **1st September** in **full-time** and then
switches to **half-time** on **1st April 2024**, the calculation will
be:

[$$250\text{€} \times (7/12) + 125\text{€} \times (2/12) = 166\text{€}$$]{.overflow-scroll}
:::

### Exceptions & adjustments

If an employee worked full-time for the entire reference period but did
not receive **250€**, certain non-assimilated leave days may have
affected the calculation.

The following leave types are **not** considered for eco-voucher
entitlement:

- **Unpaid leaves**
- **Sick leave compensated by mutual insurance** (after 30 days of work
  incapacity)

### Usage & validity

Eco vouchers are valid for **24 months** from the date of issuance.

::: seealso
The list of eligible products and services that can be purchased with
eco vouchers is available here:

## End of year bonus {#belgium_payroll/end_of_year_bonus}

This document explains the calculation of the thirteenth-month salary
(year-end bonus) in Belgium within Odoo. The calculation considers the
employee\'s contracts, working time rates, and applicable taxes.

### Calculation of the thirteenth-month salary

#### Eligibility criteria

- The employee must have worked for at least **six complete months** in
  the year.
- Both full-time and part-time employees are eligible, with prorated
  calculations based on work time.

#### Salary calculation

The thirteenth-month salary is computed as follows:

1.  **Determine the basic salary**:
    - Retrieve the employee\'s contractual wage.
    - Identify the applicable work rate.
2.  **Compute eligible months**:
    - If explicitly provided ([MONTHS]{.title-ref} input), use the given
      number of months.
    - Otherwise, calculate the number of complete months worked.
    - Prorate the salary for partial-year work.
3.  **Adjust for absences**:
    - Deduct unpaid absences to obtain the presence prorata.
    - Consider up to 60 days of sick leave as paid time off.
4.  **Include variable revenues**:
    - If explicitly provided ([VARIABLE]{.title-ref} input), use the
      given value.
    - Otherwise, calculate the average variable revenue over the last
      year.
5.  **Final amount**:
    - The final thirteenth-month amount is the sum of the prorated fixed
      salary and average variable revenues.

### Withholding tax calculation

The withholding tax is calculated using a progressive rate system. The
process involves:

1.  **Identify the employee\'s annual taxable revenue**:
    - Compute the annualized salary, including benefits in kind (e.g.,
      company car, internet, mobile phone, laptop).
    - Apply reductions for dependent children.
2.  **Apply Tax Rates**:
    - Use predefined tax brackets to determine the base withholding tax
      rate.
    - If applicable, apply a reduction based on the number of dependent
      children.

#### Tax brackets

The withholding tax is applied progressively based on the following
brackets (as of 2025):

  ------------------------------------------
  Lower Bound    Upper Bound    Tax Rate
  -------------- -------------- ------------
  0.00           10,415.00      0.00%

  10,415.01      13,330.00      23.22%

  16,960.01      20,340.00      30.28%

  20,340.01      23,020.00      35.33%

  23,020.01      25,710.00      38.36%

  25,710.01      31,070.00      40.38%

  31,070.01      33,810.00      43.41%

  33,810.01      44,770.00      46.44%

  44,770.01      58,460.00      51.48%

  58,460.00      ∞              53.50%
  ------------------------------------------

#### Tax exemption

A withholding tax exemption is granted when the normal annual gross
income does not exceed a specific threshold, which is determined based
on the number of dependent children \[2\].

A disabled dependent child counts as two.

The method involves referring to a two-column table:

- **Column 1**: Indicates the number of dependent children.
- **Column 2**: Specifies the maximum allowable normal annual gross
  income, based on the number of dependent children listed in Column 1,
  which must not be exceeded to qualify for full or partial exemption
  from withholding tax.

After determining the annual gross income, two scenarios may arise:

1.  If the annual income exceeds the threshold, no exemption is granted.
2.  If the annual income does not exceed the threshold, an exemption
    will be applied.

The amount of this exemption corresponds to the difference between the
annual gross income and the threshold amount.

Of course, if this difference exceeds the base withholding tax amount,
no withholding tax will be due.

grant a reduction in withholding tax.

To determine eligibility for this reduction, one must check whether the
normal annual gross salary exceeds a certain higher threshold, which
varies according to the number of dependent children \[3\]. This

Two scenarios may arise:

1.  If the threshold amount is exceeded, no reduction will be granted.
2.  If the threshold amount is not exceeded, a reduction will be applied
    to the withholding tax amount, up to a percentage rate determined in
    Column 2.

For employees with dependent children, tax reductions apply as follows:

  -----------------------------------------------------
  No. of Children   Reduction (%)      Max Revenue
  ----------------- ------------------ ----------------
  1                 7.5%               28,245.00

  5+                75.0%              39,550.00
  -----------------------------------------------------

#### Final tax calculation

The final withholding tax amount is:

[$$\text{Tax} = \text{Gross Thirteenth Month} \times \text{Applicable Tax Rate} -
\text{Reduction (if applicable)}$$]{.overflow-scroll}

The resulting tax is deducted from the gross thirteenth-month salary to
determine the net amount payable to the employee.

The calculation considers work duration, absences, variable revenue, and
applicable withholding taxes. Odoo automates these calculations to
ensure compliance with Belgian labor laws and tax regulations.

## Holiday pay recovery {#payroll/l10n_be/holiday_pay_recovery}

This document explains how Odoo calculates the recovery of holiday pay
(both simple and double) for employees in Belgium who have changed
employers. When an employee moves from one company to another, their
previous employer may have already paid their holiday pay for the
previous year. This amount needs to be recovered by the new employer,
and this guide outlines how this is managed in Odoo.

### Understanding holiday pay in Belgium

In Belgium, employees are entitled to annual leave and corresponding
holiday pay, which consists of:

- **Simple holiday pay**: Regular salary payments for the days of leave
  taken.
- **Double holiday pay**: An additional payment, typically equal to
  approximately 92% of the gross monthly salary, given when employees
  take their annual leave.

When an employee changes jobs, their previous employer may have already
paid these amounts. To avoid double payment, the new employer needs to
recover the amounts already paid.

### Recovery of simple holiday pay

The recovery of simple holiday pay in Odoo is based on the following
criteria:

1.  The recovery applies if the employee has taken leave in the current
    year and their previous employer already paid the holiday pay.
2.  The calculation considers the number of leave days taken and the
    hours worked per week.
3.  The recovery process is split into:
    - **Year N**: The current year\'s holiday pay recovery.
    - **Year N-1**: The recovery of holiday pay from the previous year.

The system checks:

- If the employee\'s first contract date with the company was in the
  previous year.
- If the employee has a pending holiday pay recovery amount.
- If the recovery has not already been processed.
- If the employee has taken annual leave.

If all conditions are met, Odoo calculates the amount to be deducted
from the payroll to account for the holiday pay already received from
the previous employer.

### Recovery of double holiday pay

The recovery of double holiday pay follows these steps:

1.  The system verifies the employee\'s contract and determines their
    employment duration.

2.  The gross salary is calculated based on the employee\'s contract.

3.  The number of months worked in the previous year is identified.

4.  A threshold amount is computed as follows:

    [$$\text{Threshold} = \text{Current monthly salary} \times \text{Months worked in previous year}
    \times \text{Occupation rate} \times 7.67%$$]{.overflow-scroll}

    If the amount on the holiday certificate from the previous employer
    is lower than this threshold, no limit applies.

5.  The system recovers the lower of:

    - The calculated threshold.
    - The actual amount paid by the previous employer.

If the employee has worked for more than 12 months in the current
company, no double holiday pay needs to be recovered.

### How to configure in Odoo

In the employee form view, under the `Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, you can enter the various amounts from holiday
attests provided by the new employee.

![Holiday Pay Recovery Configuration.](belgium/holiday-pay-recovery-01.png)

For simple holiday pay recovery, you need to enter:

- The `Number of days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for paid leave
- The `Amount to recover`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} by the
  employee

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Recovered Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field displays
the amount already recovered.
::::

For double holiday pay recovery, you must enter a **line for each
employer\'s holiday attest**. Each line should include:

- The `# Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (number of months)
  the employee worked for that employer
- The `Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} provided to the
  employee
- The `Occupational Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

Odoo uses this data to compute a **recovery limit**. If the employee now
has a lower salary, the full amount cannot be recovered.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Be careful not to mix holiday attests for the current year (N) and the
previous year (N-1).
::::

For simple holiday pay recovery, the system deducts the amount from each
legal time-off period until:

1.  The **total amount** has been fully recovered, or
2.  The **number of time-off days** has been matched (if the employee\'s
    current salary is lower than before).

![Holiday Pay Recovery Simple Payslip.](belgium/holiday-pay-recovery-02.png)

Once the **payslip** is validated and paid, the recovered simple holiday
pay is reflected in the employee form view.

![Holiday Pay Recovery Simple Amount.](belgium/holiday-pay-recovery-03.png)

On the double holiday payslip, click
`Compute Double Pay Recovery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open
a wizard that helps calculate the recoverable amount.

In the `Double Pay Recovery Computation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} wizard, you\'ll find:

- The relevant holiday attests listed in the
  `Occupation Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- The `Double Pay To Recover`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} amount
  based on the threshold

This amount is **editable** if manual adjustments are needed.

![Holiday Pay Recovery Double Wizard.](belgium/holiday-pay-recovery-05.png)

Once validated, the double pay recovery is applied to the payslip.

![Holiday Pay Recovery Double Amount.](belgium/holiday-pay-recovery-06.png)

Odoo automates the recovery of both **simple** and **double** holiday
pay, ensuring compliance with **Belgian labor laws**. By analyzing
contract details, employment duration, and past payments, Odoo
calculates the necessary deductions and prevents duplicate holiday pay
payments.

## Individual accounts {#payroll/l10n_be/individual_accounts}

### Introduction

The individual account provides workers with a detailed overview of
their earnings, deductions (such as social security contributions,
withholding tax, etc.), and the working days performed, on a pay period
basis. Additionally, it contains all relevant administrative data
related to remuneration.

### Required information in the individual account

The individual account must include several mandatory details as
determined by Royal Decree.

**Employer identification:**

- Name, address, ONSS number, ONVA number
- Relevant joint committee (or sub-committee)
- Name of the holiday fund for workers
- Insurer for work-related accidents
- Approved social secretariat
- Relevant affiliation numbers

**Worker identification:**

- Name, address, date of birth, gender, tax status
- Type of employment contract, job title, professional qualification
- Workplace location (or note if working at multiple locations)
- Start and end date of employment
- Employee ID number, starting salary
- Remuneration components and payment periodicity

**Remuneration components:**

- Per pay period (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly):
  - Number of working days and hours (regular, additional, and overtime)
  - Days of work interruption and reasons (illness, vacations, public
    holidays, replacement days, compensatory rest days, etc.)
  - Fixed or hourly salary, variable remuneration, bonuses, meal
    vouchers, eco vouchers, holiday pay (including early holiday pay if
    applicable), severance pay, year-end bonuses (as per sectoral or
    other collective labor agreements), benefits in kind and their
    estimated value
  - Gross amount of all remuneration components
  - Amounts subject to social and tax deductions
  - Various social and tax deductions: personal ONSS contributions,
    withholding tax, special social security contributions
  - Net amount payable to the worker
  - Other payments made by the employer, including reimbursement of
    travel expenses, allowances, and other payments
- Per quarter:
  - Number of actual working days
  - Days of work interruption by reason
  - Total remuneration subject to social security contributions
  - Employee social security contribution amounts
- Per year:
  - Total amounts subject to social security contributions
  - Employee social security contribution amounts
  - Taxable remuneration and other amounts
  - Withholding tax amount

### Responsibility for establishing and updating the individual account

Belgian employers using **Odoo Payroll** can generate the individual
accounts of their workers.

However, to ensure accurate record-keeping, employers must:

- Ensure payment of sector-mandated year-end bonuses
- Ensure that all public holidays, legal vacation days, and compensatory
  rest days are taken before the end of the year
- Plan collective vacation and replacement public holidays in advance
- Pay workers their holiday pay (including early holiday pay if
  applicable)
- Distribute due eco vouchers
- Pay any required travel expenses between home and work

If these obligations are met, the corresponding data will be included in
the individual account.

### Storage and retention period of the individual account

The individual account is a social document that must be kept by the
employer for a specified period after its creation.

Employers may store individual accounts:

- At the ONSS-registered address
- At a workplace
- At their home or registered office if located in Belgium; otherwise,
  at the residence of a designated agent in Belgium
- At the office of the approved social secretariat, if affiliated

Records must be kept legible and in a format allowing efficient
oversight. The retention period is **five years** from the end of the
annual closing of the account.

### When must workers receive a copy of their individual account?

Each worker must receive a copy of their individual account:

- **During employment:** Before March 1 of the following year
- **At the end of employment:** Within two months following the end of
  the quarter in which the contract ended
- **If additional payments occur after contract termination:** A copy
  reflecting the additional payment must be provided within two months
  of the payment

Additionally, employers must issue a **simplified individual account**
with certain worker and employer details within two months of the
worker\'s employment start date.

Any modifications to mandatory details, such as job function or
workplace location, must be communicated in writing (e.g., an updated
simplified individual account) within one month of the effective change
date.

### Generate individual accounts in Odoo

Navigate to
`Payroll app --> Reporting --> Belgium --> Individual Accounts`{.interpreted-text

available and are generated 30 by 30, this could take some time
according to the number of employees.

On the first page, the `Employer Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and the `Employee Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is listed.

![Individual Account PDF Header.](belgium/individual-account-03.png)

The next page displays all the employee worked days and payslip lines,
month by month, split by structure (e.g., End of year bonus and monthly
pay).

## Intellectual property and 273 sheets {#payroll/l10n_be/273_sheets}

### Introduction

The 273S declaration is used for the **Prepayment on Mobile Income
(Pr.M)**, which concerns the taxation of **Author\'s Rights** and
**Neighboring Rights** (also known as **Revenus Mobilier**). These are
specific types of income that are subject to particular tax treatment in
certain jurisdictions.

This document provides users with essential information about how the
273S declaration functions within Odoo for reporting income derived from
these rights, including applicable tax rates and conditions.

### Tax rates and calculation

The net income from Author\'s Rights and Neighboring Rights is taxable
at a specific rate of **15%**. However, the effective tax rate can vary
based on the application of flat-rate deductions. These flat rates
reduce the taxable amount, leading to a lower effective tax rate for
lower incomes.

Key points of taxation:

- **Effective tax rate**:
  - For incomes below the first flat-rate threshold, the effective tax
    rate can be as low as **7.5%**.
  - For incomes reaching the flat-rate ceiling of **37,500 EUR**
    (indexed annually), the rate can increase to **12%**.
- **Additional taxes**: Income from Author\'s Rights and Neighboring
  Rights must be declared in the personal income tax declaration. As a
  result, municipal surcharges may also apply to the tax due.

The **prepayment** of the tax is handled via a withholding tax on the
income. The debtor of the income (e.g., the employer or company paying
the royalties) must submit the 273S declaration to the tax authorities.
This withholding tax rate is generally **15%**, but for incomes
exceeding the indexed ceiling of **37,500 EUR**, the rate increases to
**30%**.

### Benefits of Author\'s Rights in employment contracts

Companies can offer tax-advantageous remuneration to their directors or
employees by granting **Author\'s Rights**. These rights are subject to
a **15% withholding tax**, but there are flat-rate deductions that make
this tax treatment very favorable, especially when incomes are lower.

Important considerations:

- **Creative works**: To qualify for Author\'s Rights protection, the
  work must be creative, original, and fixed in a tangible form. Simple
  ideas or concepts are not eligible.
- **Exploitation requirement**: From January 1, 2023, a new regulation
  mandates that transferred or licensed protected works must be
  exploited, meaning they must be used for public communication,
  execution, representation, or reproduction.
- **Eligibility for tax benefits**: To benefit from the favorable tax
  regime, the rights holder must meet specific criteria, such as:
  - Holding an \"Artistic Work Certificate.\"
  - Licensing or transferring rights to a third party for public
    communication or reproduction.
- **Income ratio restrictions**: The proportion of income from Author\'s
  Rights in relation to regular salary will be capped at **30%**, with
  **70%** of the total income being subject to regular income tax.
- **Income cap**: The absolute ceiling for qualifying income under this
  regime remains **37,500 EUR** (indexed at **70,220 EUR** for the 2024
  income year).

If your average income from the last four years exceeds this ceiling,
you will no longer be eligible for the advantageous tax regime.

- **Ruling Request**: For greater clarity on the scope and remuneration
  of the transfer of Author\'s Rights, an advanced agreement with the
  tax authorities (referred to as a **ruling**) can be requested.

### Tax treatment of Author\'s Rights income

Since 2008, income from the transfer or licensing of Author\'s Rights
has benefited from a favorable tax treatment. Specifically, the income
is subject to:

- **15% Withholding Tax** up to an indexed ceiling of **70,220 EUR**
  (2023 income year).
- **Flat-Rate Deductions**:
  - **50% flat-rate deduction** applies to the first **18,720 EUR** of
    income.
  - **25% flat-rate deduction** applies to the next **18,730 EUR** (from
    **18,720 EUR to 37,450 EUR**).

Example of tax impact:

For example, if a company director receives **10,000 EUR** in Author\'s
Rights income, they will pay **750 EUR** in tax (15% of the income after
the flat-rate deductions), leaving them with a net income of **9,250
EUR**. This results in an effective tax rate of **7.5%** on the
Author\'s Rights income.

### Odoo integration for Declaration 273S

Odoo users can efficiently manage the submission of the **273S
Declaration** for Author\'s Rights and Neighboring Rights income via the
**Odoo Payroll** module. Here\'s a quick overview of how this can be
done:

#### Set up Author\'s Rights in Odoo

On the employees form view, make sure the
`Intellectual Property`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox is
enabled, and the allocated salary percentage is specified as well.

Once a payslip is generated, the
`IP (intellectual property)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} part is
computed based on the intellectual property percentage and the gross
salary. The tax is computed accordingly based on the revenue amount.

![Intellectual Property Payslip 1.](belgium/273s-07.png)

![Intellectual Property Payslip 2.](belgium/273s-08.png)

#### Generate the 273S form

Odoo can generate the 273S form automatically based on the income data
entered into the system. Ensure that all required details, including the
amount of income subject to the tax, are accurately entered.

Navigate to
`Payroll app --> Reporting --> Belgium --> 273S Sheet`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to create a `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} record.

Select the reference `Year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then click
`Export XML file`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to generate the
declaration. Click `Export PDF File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to generate the printed details.

![273S Wizard File Generation.](belgium/273s-03.png)

On the first PDF section, the company information and the global
declaration is listed.

![273S PDF Company Info.](belgium/273s-04.png)

On the second section, the employees specific information is listed.

![273S PDF Employee Info.](belgium/273s-05.png)

#### File the 273S Declaration

After generating the XML file, the company or the debtor of the income
can submit it to the tax authorities directly from MyMinfin. Keep track
of the filing and payment deadlines to ensure timely submission and
compliance.

### Conclusion

The **273S Declaration** is an essential tool for companies and
individuals benefiting from the favorable tax regime on Author\'s Rights
and Neighboring Rights. By leveraging Odoo\'s tax management features,
users can ensure compliance while optimizing their tax liabilities.

For further assistance, please consult a tax professional.

## Representation fees {#payroll/l10n_be/representation_fees}

### Introduction

Representation fees must be **allocated on the payslip** between
**serious and non-serious representation costs**. By default, the
threshold is set at **€283.73**, but it can be adjusted based on what
the company can **legally justify**.

The representation fees is configured on the employee\'s contract form
in the `Expense
Fees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

On the payslip, two or one line are displayed in the case the
representation fees amount exceeds the threshold or not.

### Breakdown of the threshold

Only part of the representation costs are pro-rated because certain
costs are **fully covered** by the company. These fixed costs include:

[$$\begin{aligned}
\text{€}283.73\text{ Total} = \begin{cases}
+ \text{ €148.73 (Tax, since 2021 - coronavirus)} \\
+ \text{ €30 (Internet)} \\
+ \text{ €25 (Phone)} \\
+ \text{ €80 (Car management fees)} \\
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}$$]{.overflow-scroll}

The **serious portion** of the representation costs is **not prorated**,
while the **non-serious portion** is prorated based on working time.

Navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Salary --> Rule Parameters`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and search for the [CP200: Representation Fees
Threshold]{.title-ref} record. Then, adapt the current value or
introduce a new one from a given date.

![Representation Fees Threshold.](belgium/representation-fees-01.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note

It is possible to define, based on job position, which jobs are eligible
to certain criteria in the `Payroll`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab.

![Representation Fees Job Position.](belgium/representation-fees-04.png)
::::

### Calculation of representation fees

#### Conditions for payment

Representation fees are only granted if:

- The employee **receives a basic salary**, and
- The employee has **worked at least part of the time**, unless a
  **salary simulation** is in progress.

If the employee is on **full leave** (without any working days), they
are **not eligible** for representation fees.

#### Determining the work time rate

- The number of **working days per week** is extracted from the
  employee\'s contract.
- If the employee has periods of **incapacity for work** (e.g.,
  illness), the calculation adjusts the **work time rate** accordingly:
  - The total **incapacity hours** are determined.

  - If the company follows a **biweekly schedule**, the incapacity hours
    are divided by **two**.

  - The incapacity **rate** is calculated as:

    [$$\text{incapacity rate} = 1 - \frac{\text{incapacity hours}}{\text{total weekly hours}}$$]{.overflow-scroll}

  - The **final work time rate** is then adjusted by multiplying it with
    the incapacity rate.

#### Applying the threshold and pro-rating rules

- The **default threshold (€283.73)** is applied unless adjusted by the
  company.
- If the employee has **worked a full-time schedule**, they receive the
  **full representation fees** without reduction.
- If the employee works **part-time** (contractual or due to time
  credit), only the **non-serious portion** of the fees is prorated.
  - The prorated formula for non-serious expenses is:

    [$$\text{adjusted amount} = \text{threshold} + (\text{total fees} - \text{threshold}) \times
    \frac{\text{work time rate}}{100}$$]{.overflow-scroll}
- If the employee has **missing workdays**, the final amount is further
  adjusted:
  - First calculate the **daily reduction**:

    [$$\text{daily reduction} = \frac{(\text{total amount} - \text{threshold}) \times 3}{13 \times \text{days per week}}$$]{.overflow-scroll}

  - Then calculate the **final amount**:

    [$$\text{final amount} = max(0, \text{total amount} - \text{daily reduction} \times
    \text{missing days})$$]{.overflow-scroll}

#### Final calculation

- If the employee meets all conditions, the final representation fees
  amount is **rounded to two decimal places** for payroll purposes.
- Employees working a full schedule receive **full reimbursement**,
  while those working **reduced hours** have the **non-serious portion
  prorated** accordingly.

### Conclusion

This calculation ensures **fair allocation** of representation fees by
distinguishing between **fixed serious costs** and **prorated
non-serious costs**. The company can adjust the **threshold (€283.73 by
default)** based on **justifiable business expenses**.

Employees working **full-time** receive their full representation fees,
while those working **part-time or with absences** only receive a
**pro-rated portion** of the non-serious fees.

## Sick time off and relapse {#payroll/l10n_be/sick_time_off}

In Belgium, sick leave is managed according to two main regimes:

- **With guaranteed salary**: The employer continues to pay the
  worker\'s salary for a specified period.
- **Without guaranteed salary**: The worker receives benefits from the
  mutual insurance company after the guaranteed salary period.

### Sick leave with guaranteed salary

The guaranteed salary is a period during which the employer continues to
pay the salary of the worker who is unable to work.

**Employees**: The employer pays 100% of the salary during the first
full month of incapacity. After this period, if the incapacity
continues, the worker falls under the mutual insurance regime.

### Sick leave without guaranteed salary

After the guaranteed salary period, the ONEM (National Employment
Office) or the mutual insurance company takes over.

- **Long-term illness**: An incapacity lasting more than 30 days leads
  to benefits from the mutual insurance company.
- **Relapse**: If a worker returns to work and then becomes ill again
  for the same reason within 14 days, this may be considered a relapse,
  and the rules for guaranteed salary may be adjusted.

### Management in Odoo

In Odoo, sick leave is automatically managed if the absences are related
to the *Sick Time Off* work entry type.

- **Recording time off**: The employee records their absence through the
  **Time Off** module.
- **Automation of work entries**: If the request is approved, Odoo
  automatically generates the corresponding Work Entries.
- **Impact on payroll**: The guaranteed salary is automatically
  calculated according to the rules configured based on the worker\'s
  status (employee).
- **Compensation after the guaranteed salary**: Once the guaranteed
  salary period has expired, Odoo adjusts the Work Entries to reflect
  the transition to the mutual insurance company.

Thus, Odoo ensures a smooth and compliant management of sick leave
according to Belgian regulations.

## Social Balance Sheet {#payroll/l10n_be/social_balance_sheet}

### Introduction

The *Social Balance Sheet* was introduced by the law of December 22,
1995, as part of measures for the implementation of the multi-year
employment plan. Companies required to file annual accounts (including
some that are not obligated to publish such accounts - see the [National
Bank of Belgium website](https://www.nbb.be) for details) must also
prepare and submit a Social Balance Sheet to the National Bank of
Belgium.

The Royal Decree of August 4, 1996, incorporates the Social Balance
Sheet into the annual accounts, specifically as an annex. This makes it
an integral part of a company\'s financial statements.

### Contents of the Social Balance Sheet

The content of the Social Balance Sheet is determined by the Royal
Decree of January 30, 2001, implementing the Company Code. The Social
Balance Sheet consists of several sections:

- Sections I and II: Information on employed persons and personnel
  movements during the fiscal year.
- Section III: Initiatives related to training.

Since the Social Balance Sheet is part of a company\'s annual accounts,
the works council receives this information as part of its mission
regarding economic and financial information.

Additionally, the works council receives data on employment-related
benefits along with annual employment-related information (Trillium).
These details were fully integrated into the Social Balance Sheet until
2008.

### Scope of the Social Balance Sheet

The Social Balance Sheet contains specific data related to workforce
composition, staff turnover, and training programs. Some organizations
not required to publish annual accounts must still file a separate
Social Balance Sheet. This applies primarily to certain hospitals and
private legal entities employing at least 20 full-time equivalents
(FTEs).

Any company, association, or foundation with at least 20 workers on an
annual average (in FTE) must complete and submit the Social Balance
Sheet.

The Social Balance Sheet is part of:

- \"Other documents to be filed under the Company and Associations
  Code\" (for companies);
- \"Explanatory Notes\" (for associations and foundations).

### Obligations by entity type

#### Companies, associations, and foundations required to publish a Social Balance Sheet

For Belgian companies employing at least one FTE:

- **Standardized model**: This schema includes a \"Social Balance
  Sheet\" section, which must be completed.
- **Specific model**: If the model used does not include a Social
  Balance Sheet, it must be provided separately.

For Belgian associations and foundations employing at least 20 FTEs:

- **Standard model**: Includes a \"Social Balance Sheet\" section that
  must be completed.
- **Specific model**: A separate Social Balance Sheet must be submitted
  if the chosen model does not include one.

Associations and foundations with fewer than 20 FTEs may voluntarily
complete the Social Balance Sheet but are not legally required to do so.

For foreign companies, such as branches of foreign corporations and
foreign non-profit organizations (ASBL) with activities in Belgium, the
Social Balance Sheet applies only to their Belgian operations.

The Social Balance Sheet is made publicly available by the Central
Balance Sheet Office as part of the financial statements submission.

#### Entities required to file a separate Social Balance Sheet

Certain organizations that do not need to publish annual accounts must
still submit a Social Balance Sheet to the Central Balance Sheet Office.
This data is used exclusively for statistical purposes and is not made
publicly available. Submission in these cases is free of charge.

This exception applies to:

- **Hospitals**, unless they are structured as limited liability
  companies or large ASBLs, which must submit full financial statements,
  including the integrated Social Balance Sheet.
- **Private legal entities** that are not required to submit annual
  accounts but have at least 20 employees.

The required model depends on the entity type:

- **Hospitals** must use the full or abridged Social Balance Sheet model
  based on their size.
- **Foreign entities** must use the full or abridged Social Balance
  Sheet model, based on the size of their Belgian establishments.
- **Private legal entities** with at least 50 employees must use the
  full model, while those with 20-49 employees may use the abridged
  model.

## Time off {#payroll/l10n_be/time_off}

### Legal time off {#payroll/l10n_be/legal_time_off}

This guide provides an overview of the basic rules governing legal
holiday entitlements in Belgium for employers using Odoo.

#### Holiday entitlement calculation

Your holiday entitlement for the current year (N) is determined by the
number of months worked in Belgium during the previous year (N-1).

**Calculation details:**

- Employees earn **2 days of leave per month** based on a 6-day work
  week.
- The entitlement is adjusted for a 5-day work week:
  $(\text{Total Days} \div 6) \times 5$.

::: example
If an employee worked **7 months** in the previous year (N-1):

- **6-day work week:** $7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ days}$
- **5-day work week:** $14 \div 6 \times 5 = 11.67 \text{ days}$
:::

**Partial Month Calculation:**

- Worked **1st to 10th**: Full month counted.
- Worked **11th to 19th**: Half month counted.
- Worked **20th onwards**: Month not counted.

**Rounding Rules:**

- Less than **0.35**: Round to **0**.
- Between **0.35 - 0.74**: Round to **0.5**.
- **0.75 and above**: Round to **1**.

For a full-time employee, this typically results in **11.5 days of legal
holiday** entitlement.

#### Maximum holiday entitlement

Employees are entitled to a maximum of **4 weeks** of holiday based on
their working schedule. If an employee switches between full-time and
part-time work, their entitlement is adjusted accordingly.

**Calculation details:**

- **5-day work week**: $4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ days}$
- **4-day work week**: $4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ days}$
- **3-day work week**: $4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ days}$

::: example
If an employee joined **Odoo on January 1, 2024**, and plans to switch
to a **3-day work week from April 1, 2024**:

**Step 1: Calculate holiday entitlement for 2024**

- The employee worked **9 months in 2023**.
- **6-day work week basis**: $9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ days}$
- Adjusted for **5-day work week**:
  $18 \div 6 \times 5 = 15 \text{ days}$

**Step 2: Verify maximum holiday entitlement**

- For a **5-day work week**, the maximum entitlement is **20 days**.
- Since the employee is entitled to **15 days**, they remain within the
  limit.

**Step 3: Adjust entitlement for the new work schedule**

- From April 1, 2024, the employee moves to a **3-day work week**.
- Maximum entitlement for a **3-day work week**:
  $3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ days}$.
- If no leave is taken before April 1, the employee may take up to **12
  days** from their 15-day entitlement.
- The **remaining 3 days** will be settled at the end of the year.
:::

This ensures compliance with Belgian legal leave regulations and allows
employers to manage holiday entitlements effectively within Odoo.

#### Legal time off allocation

This is possible to generate the legal time off for all your employees
at the beginning of a new year using the wizard in
`Payroll app --> Reporting --> Belgium --> Paid Time Off
Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Based on your employees occupation over last year, the number of
available time off is pre-computed for each employee.

![Paid Time Off Allocation Wizard.](belgium/paid-time-off-allocation-01.png)

Once validated, a draft allocation is generated for each single
employee, waiting a manual confirmation that can be done in batch.

![Paid Time Off Allocations.](belgium/paid-time-off-allocation-02.png)

### European time off {#payroll/l10n_be/european_time_off}

#### How does it work?

If you were not subject to Belgian ONSS contributions before joining our
company and do not have entitlement to legal holidays, or if your
entitlement is incomplete, you can apply for European leave.

To qualify for European leave in a given year, you must work for at
least 3 months during that year, whether with us or another employer.
Once you have met this requirement, you will earn 5 days of European
leave. Subsequently, you will accumulate additional days of vacation
each month as follows:

- After 3 months: 5 days
- After 4 months: 7 days
- After 5 months: 9 days
- After 6 months: 10 days
- After 7 months: 12 days
- After 8 months: 14 days
- After 9 months: 15 days
- After 10 months: 17 days
- After 11 months: 19 days

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The total of legal leave and European leave cannot exceed 20 days per
year. You must use all your legal holidays before taking European leave.

European leave entitlement expires on December 31st of the year it is
earned and cannot be carried over to the following year. To qualify for
European leave in a new year, you must complete another 3 months of
work.
::::

#### How are these days paid?

European leaves are paid holidays taken in advance of your \"Double
Holiday Pay\" (the June extra pay) for the following year. Essentially,
the more European leave days you take in a given year, the less you will
receive as June extra pay in the following year.

## Working schedule change {#payroll/l10n_be/working_schedule_change}

This guide explains how to modify an employee\'s working time schedule
in the Belgian payroll module of Odoo. Changing an employee\'s working
hours affects their wage calculation, time-off allocation, and contract
terms.

### Steps to change an employee\'s working schedule

1.  Navigate to the employee\'s contract
    (`Payroll app --> Contracts`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}), and select the contract of the employee
    whose working schedule you want to modify.
2.  Click on `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    `(Action)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select
    `Working Schedule Change`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
    wizard displays the current contract details and allows you to set
    new working time parameters.
3.  Set the new working schedule:
    - Choose the new `Working Schedule`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"} from the available resource calendars.
    - Define the `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
      change (mandatory).
    - If applicable, specify an `End Date`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"}.
    - If the `Part Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox is
      selected, any difference between the reference calendar and the
      employee\'s new calendar will be covered using the *Absence Work
      Entry Type*. This ensures that the employee\'s monthly salary
      remains the same, regardless of the number of absence days in a
      given month. This setup is required for configuring *Time Credit*,
      *Parental Leave*, or *Medical Half-Time* correctly.
4.  Adjust the employee\'s wage:
    - The wizard automatically computes the full-time equivalent wage
      based on the new working schedule.
    - You can review and modify the new wage if necessary.
5.  Manage time off allocation:
    - Select the relevant `Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"}.

    - Odoo automatically adjusts the employee\'s time-off entitlement
      based on the new working schedule using the following formula:

      [$$\text{New Time Off Allocation} = \max(\min(\text{ Computed Allocation},
      \text{ Max Allocation}) + \text{ Leaves Taken}, \text{ Leaves Taken})$$]{.overflow-scroll}

      - **Computed Allocation** is the expected leave allocation based
        on the new schedule.
      - **Max Allocation** is the maximum number of days allowed under
        the new working time.
      - **Leaves Taken** ensures the employee does not receive fewer
        days than already used.
6.  Decide on a follow-up contract
    - If the working time change is temporary, you can enable
      `Post Change Contract
      Creation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to automatically
      create a contract that resumes the previous working schedule after
      the specified end date.
7.  Validate the changes
    - Click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to apply the
      new working schedule.
    - If the new schedule is the same as the current one, an error will
      be displayed.
    - The system will create a new contract with the updated working
      time and wage.
    - If a previous contract existed, it will be closed with an end date
      before the new contract begins.

### Result

- The employee\'s new working schedule is recorded.
- Wage and time-off entitlements are adjusted accordingly.
- A follow-up contract is created if applicable.

## Work entries exports {#payroll/l10n_be/work_entries_exports}

### What are work entries?

In the context of payroll, *work entries* typically refer to records or
documentation related to an employee\'s work hours and earnings for a
specific pay period. These entries are crucial for accurately
calculating and processing employee compensation.

Work entries in the context of payroll are essential for both employees
and employers. They provide a transparent and accurate record of an
employee\'s compensation and deductions, ensuring that employees are
paid correctly and that tax and legal requirements are met. Payroll
software and systems are commonly used to manage and automate these work
entries, making the payroll process more efficient and accurate.

### Main concepts

#### General

In Odoo, work entries mainly refer to *time entries* (attendance
tracking), these are work entries that consist of time records, which
include the number of hours worked by an employee during a given pay
period. These entries may specify regular working hours, overtime hours,
and any other relevant time-related information, such as breaks, paid
time off, unpaid time off, parental leave, credit-time, etc.

Work entries serve a dual role in payroll management. First, they enable
organizations to independently compute employee payslips. Second, they
facilitate the transmission of pertinent data to external payroll
service providers, who then use this information to calculate and
generate the payslips.

#### Work entries

- They have a Name: used to identify the type of entry (e.g.,
  Attendance, Paid Time Off, etc.).
- They have a Payroll Code: used in Odoo\'s salary rules computations
- They have an External Code: used to provide the correct Work Entry
  code to an external payroll service provider.
- They are generated based on the configuration of the contract and the
  time off types
- They have a duration, a start and end date, a state and are always
  linked to an employee.

#### Work entry types

- They are the main source of configuration for your work entries.
  Thanks to your different types of work entries, you\'ll be able to
  differentiate the time records of your employees.
- They have a name.
- They contain a code, external code, payroll code and a color for
  visual tracking.
- They allow other types of configurations such as how they are
  displayed in payslips, decide whether this type of work entry should
  be considered as paid or unpaid (eg. unpaid leave), decide whether
  this type of work entry has a link with time off, is valid for some
  advantages or how it should be reflected in your reporting.

#### Time off types

As mentioned above, since work entry types can be linked to a time off
type, you are also able to define the work entry type for each time-off
type. On the time off type you have a many2one relation with the work
entry type.

### Steps to generate the work entries of your staff

1.  Create all the employees

2.  Create a contract and set its status to `Running`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} for each employee.

    In the contract, choose the `Work Entry Source`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}. It tells the system how work entries for an
    employee should be generated. It can be based on:

    - `Working Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Odoo uses
      the predefined working hours and days set in the employee\'s
      working schedule to generate work entries. This is useful for
      regular, predictable shifts.
    - `Attendances`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Work entries are
      generated from the employee\'s attendance records (i.e., when they
      check-in and check-out).
    - `Planning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Work entries are
      created based on the validated shifts or slots allocated to the
      employee in the **Planning** app (often used for scheduling roles
      like retail shifts, restaurants, etc.).

3.  Generate the work entries each month

    Odoo automatically creates the work entries in the **Payroll** app
    based on the work entry source of the contract and the different
    time-offs taken. You can edit the work entries manually. You can
    always decide to regenerate work entries manually but be careful if
    you already made some manual changes, Odoo will regenerate the work
    entries based on what it knows (e.g., your working schedule and time
    off).

4.  Managing conflicts

    Conflicts are pointing to entries that can\'t be validated without
    your intervention. This means you\'ll have to qualify the entry and
    decide which is the correct entry to be defined for the time period
    if you want to be able to generate the payslip or validate the
    entries. Conflicts arise when there are overlapping entries or when
    Odoo detects that there is a time off request still pending for
    validation. For instance, if an employee is marked as attending work
    and at the same time there\'s a paid leave request to be validated
    for the same period, that\'s a conflict.

    Conflicts can be managed by filtering on the conflicting entries and
    resolving the discrepancy. Since **Odoo 16.4**, Odoo filters by
    default on conflicting entries. For prior versions, you can still
    filter manually on conflicting entries or use the conflicting menu
    item.

5.  Once the conflict is resolved you can either proceed to generate the
    payslips for your employees or export your work entries to the right
    entity.

### Export work entries

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

This section is about exporting work entries to SD Worx, but the
configuration and behavior is similar for other exports to Partena,
Group S and UCM.
::::

#### Introduction

This sheet is here to help you learn how Odoo\'s **SD Worx**
([l10n_be_hr_payroll_sd_worx]{.title-ref}) module simplifies payroll by
enabling easy export of work entries. This guide provides quick steps to
generate `.txt`{.interpreted-text role="file"} files for direct import
into SD Worx calendars, saving time and ensuring accuracy.

First and foremost, it\'s important to understand there is no direct
integration between Odoo and SD Worx. There is no automatic exchange of
information, either way. Odoo does not communicate directly with SD
Worx, and the reverse is also true.

#### How does it work?

In reality, Odoo provides a standardized export in .txt format for
employees\' work entries, allowing the generation of a file that
conforms to a specific format for inputting these entries into the SD
Worx software.

#### What does it mean in terms of data management?

Since there is no direct integration between both systems, it implies
that certain data will need to be manually entered into both systems.
For instance, when you create a new employee in Odoo, you\'ll also need
to manually create the employee in SD Worx (and vice versa). This manual
data entry requirement extends to various aspects such as contracts,
work schedules, salary details, and personal information about
employees.

Essentially, all the information necessary for SD Worx to calculate
salaries and generate payslips must be manually inputted into both
systems.

#### What\'s the advantage of exporting to SD worx?

Odoo is an integrated software that can comprehensively handle all
variable payroll elements, including employee personal information,
contract details, various time-off types, and other work entry
categories. Through Odoo\'s integration capabilities, you can access all
this crucial data in one centralized location, making it easily
accessible for your HR team and employees.

This integration not only ensures data accuracy but also maintains
consistency, reducing the likelihood of errors when transmitting work
entry information to your external payroll provider. With the module in
place, a single click generates a `.txt`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
file that\'s ready for direct import into SD Worx, streamlining the
entire data transmission process.

#### Steps to set up the SD Worx module

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

You must be logged into a Belgian company for the following steps to
work.
::::

1.  `install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
    **Belgium - Payroll - Export to SD Worx**
    ([l10n_be_hr_payroll_sd_worx]{.title-ref}) module.
2.  Go to `Payroll app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} to fill in the `SD
    Worx code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. This is the
    company\'s SD Worx code, you get it directly from the SD worx
    software. When you create a company, it has a unique identifier
    which you need to set in the field.
3.  For each employee, under the `Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} tab, fill in the `SDWorx code`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field.
4.  For work entry types, under the `Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} tab, fill in the `SDWorx code`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field as well.

You can now export your work entries in the SD Worx
`.txt`{.interpreted-text role="file"} format by opening the wizard under
`Payroll app --> Reporting --> Belgium --> Export Work Entries to SDWorx`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

The file contains a series of lines such as the following line of text:
[1111110000024K2023042370100360]{.title-ref}

Each line represents a work entry, and the structure is outlined below:

- [111111]{.title-ref} -\> Company SD Worx code
- [0000024]{.title-ref} -\> Employee SD Worx code
- [K]{.title-ref} -\> Delimiter
- [20230423]{.title-ref} -\> Date
- [7010]{.title-ref} -\> SD Worx work entry code
- [0360]{.title-ref} -\> Duration (edited)

Once the `.txt`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file is exported, it can
be directly imported in this format into the SD Worx software. Doing so
updates the calendars of each collaborator.

## 274.XX sheets {#payroll/l10n_be/274xx_sheets}

This section provides an overview of Declaration 274, its components,
and how it is handled within Odoo.

### Declaration 274.10

Withholding tax is an advance payment on professional income tax. It is
calculated based on guidelines established by the tax administration.
While reducing withholding tax is generally not allowed, employees may
request to pay more in order to better match their final tax liability.

Withholding tax must be deducted from both employees\' and company
directors\' income. If the withholding tax is insufficient, advance tax
payments must be made to avoid additional tax penalties.

In practice, some employees do not inform their employer of personal
changes (e.g., having a child), which can affect tax calculations.

Withholding tax must be declared and paid either quarterly or monthly
using form 274. These declarations must be submitted via the FINPROF
application by the 15th of the month following the reporting period.

Taxable income and corresponding withholding tax must be recorded in
fiscal remuneration forms 281.x and summary statements 325x. Employers
failing to report these correctly may be subject to a 309% penalty on
undisclosed amounts.

The tax administration compares the declared amounts in form 274 with
the amounts reported in the fiscal forms. If withholding tax payments
are insufficient, the company may be charged the difference. If a 274
form is submitted without corresponding tax payment, additional tax
penalties will apply.

It is crucial to adhere to all administrative guidelines to avoid
unexpected tax charges.

### Declarations 274.32, 274.33, 274.34

#### Withholding tax exemptions for research employees

Companies employing scientific researchers may qualify for withholding
tax reductions under specific conditions:

- **Form 281.32** applies to civil engineers and PhD holders.
- **Form 281.33** applies to employees holding a master\'s degree.
- **Form 281.34** applies to employees holding a bachelor\'s degree.

Employers engaged in scientific research may be eligible for an
exemption from withholding tax payments. To qualify, they must register
their R&D projects with Belspo. From August 1, 2023, this registration
must occur before the project begins.

#### Tax exemption details

This tax incentive allows companies to retain 80% of the withholding tax
deducted from researchers\' salaries. However, the exemption rate
differs for researchers based on their qualifications:

- PhD and master\'s degree holders: Full 80% exemption.
- Bachelor\'s degree holders: 50% of the full exemption amount.
- For non-SME companies, this limit is further reduced to 25%.

The exemption applies only to the portion of working time dedicated to
scientific research, covering fundamental research, industrial research,
or experimental development.

This exemption does not affect the net salary of employees.

#### Capping rules

The total exemption granted to researchers with a bachelor\'s degree is
limited to 25% of the exemption granted to PhD and master\'s degree
holders. For small companies (as defined in Article 15 §§ 1-6 of the
Companies Code), this limit is doubled. These rules have remained
unchanged since January 1, 2020.

### How it works in Odoo

Odoo automates the calculation and declaration of withholding tax
exemptions using predefined payroll structures. Below is an explanation
of how the system processes these exemptions.

Navigate to
`Payroll app --> Reporting --> 274.XX Sheets`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to create a new declaration.

Select the reference `Year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the different amounts
are computed accordingly.

1.  **Payroll calculation**
    - Odoo calculates gross salary and total withholding tax.
    - It accounts for specific payroll components, including December
      double bonuses.
2.  **Filtering eligible payslips**
    - Payslips linked to research-related contracts are considered.
    - Employees are categorized based on their qualifications (PhD,
      master\'s, or bachelor\'s degrees).
3.  **Exemption calculation**
    - The withholding tax exemption is calculated at 80% of the withheld
      amount.
    - Exemptions for bachelor\'s degree holders are capped according to
      regulations.
4.  **Final adjustments**
    - The system ensures compliance with legal capping rules.
    - If necessary, adjustments are made based on the total exemption
      granted.

### Submitting the XML declaration

After generating the XML file, it must be submitted to the Belgian tax
authorities. Ensure you are familiar with the [official submission
process](https://finances.belgium.be/fr/E-services/Belcotaxonweb/documentation-technique).

The XML files containing the fiscal data to be sent via the
Belcotax-on-web (BOW) application must be converted to the .bow format.

This conversion requires the use of a validation module available under
the *Technical Documentation* section.

The validation module has two prerequisites:

- Java 8 must be installed.
- The certificate authority that signed the validation module must be
  recognized.

## 281.45 Declaration {#payroll/l10n_be/28145_declaration}

# Egypt

The Egypt **Payroll** localization package enables payroll processing
that fully complies with Egyptian labor laws. It calculates progressive
income tax, employee- and employer-paid social security, and core salary
components, including housing and transportation allowances.

## Configuration

`Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the following
modules to get all the features of the Egypt **Payroll** localization:

  Name                                                                   Technical name                             Description
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `Egypt - Payroll`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}                   [l10n_eg_hr_payroll]{.title-ref}           Payroll module includes all salary rules, leave logic, and compensation rules compliant with Egyptian Labor Law.
  `Egypt - Payroll with Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}   [l10n_eg_hr_payroll_account]{.title-ref}   Adds account mappings related to payroll calculations.

::: seealso
`Egypt fiscal localization documentation <../../../finance/fiscal_localizations/egypt>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Egyptian employee contracts

Once an employee has been
`created in the database <../../employees/new_employee>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, a
`contract must be created <payroll/new-contract>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

To check if the user already has a contract, navigate to the
**Employees** app, then click on the employee\'s Kanban card. The
`fa-book`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Contracts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button displays a red zero when no contract
exists. Otherwise, it displays
`In contract since (contract start date)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in green.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Contracts can also be found by navigating to
`Employees app --> Employees -->
Contracts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. All contracts appear
in a list view, grouped by status.
::::

Populate the following contractual information in the
`Salary Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
contract:

- `Social Insurance Reference Amount`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: Used as the base amount for calculating the
  `social insurance employee and employer portions
  <payroll/payroll_localizations/social-insurance>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- `Number of Leave Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Used for
  calculating the `provision amount for the annual
  leave for the employee <payroll/payroll_localizations/provisions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- `Provision Number of Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  Corresponds with the number of days used in the calculation of the
  `provision value of the end of service for the employee
  <payroll/payroll_localizations/provisions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- `Total Number of Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Refers to
  the number of days used to calculate the
  `end-of-service benefit paid to the employee when their employment with the company ends
  <payroll/payroll_localizations/end-of-service>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

## Social insurance {#payroll/payroll_localizations/social-insurance}

Social insurance rules calculate the contribution amounts that are to be
paid by the employer and employee to the
`NOSI (National Organization for Social Insurance)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. This is only available for Egyptian employees.

The employer contributes 18.75% of the social insurance reference amount
for the employee. On the other hand, the employee contributes 11% of
their insurance reference amount, and that amount gets deducted from the
payslip amount.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The social insurance reference amount is set per employee in their
contracts.
::::

## Leaves

The following leave types are available to employees working in Egypt:
`Annual leave
<payroll/payroll_localizations/annual>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`Sick leave <payroll/payroll_localizations/sick>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`Unpaid leave <payroll/payroll_localizations/unpaid>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and `Other leave types
<payroll/payroll_localizations/other>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

### Annual leave {#payroll/payroll_localizations/annual}

Employees are eligible for 21 days of annual leave, and if the employee
requires more days, they have to be
`requested from HR managers <time_off/request-allocation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} accordingly.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Since the annual leave is fully paid, it is not connected to a salary
rule, but it will appear on the worked days on the payslip form and on
the PDF printout.
::::

### Sick leave {#payroll/payroll_localizations/sick}

Three cases exist for sick leaves in terms of the amount to be deducted
from the employee:

- `Fully paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: first 30 calendar
  days each year (affects only working entries; no payroll deduction).

  **Payroll computation** =(Daily Wage)

- `75% paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: next 60 days; payroll
  rule deducts 25% of an employee\'s salary.

  **Payroll computation** =(Daily Wage \* 0.25)

- `0% paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: after 90 days; payroll
  rule deducts 100% of an employee\'s salary.

  **Payroll computation** =(Daily Wage \* 0.00)

### Unpaid leave {#payroll/payroll_localizations/unpaid}

Deductions are applied on the employee\'s salary based on the number of
unpaid leave days taken, and it is calculated by dividing the monthly
salary for the employee by 30 to get the daily salary and then
multiplying it by the number of unpaid leave days taken.

### Other leave types {#payroll/payroll_localizations/other}

These are leave types considered fully paid and do not affect the end
payslip, but are tracked in the working entries:

- Maternity leave
- Hajj leave
- Death leave

## Income tax

In Egypt, employees are subject to a progressive income tax system,
where tax rates increase with higher annual income brackets.

### Tax brackets

Depending on the annual income of the employee, the following rates
apply:

+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
| Taxable | \<600k  | 600k -  | 700k -  | 800k -  | 900k -  | \>1.2M  |

+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+

### Exemptions

Employees are eligible to an EGP 20,000 personal exception on their
gross income.

## Overtime

Depending on the time of day and the time at which the overtime is
recorded in, the additional amount to be paid to the employee can be as
follows:

- During daytime hours on working days, the amount is 1.35x times the
  employee\'s hourly wage.
- During nighttime hours on working days, the amount is 1.70x times the
  employee\'s hourly wage.
- On rest days and public holidays: The amount is 2.0x times the
  employee\'s hourly wage.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Overtime hours are registered as other inputs directly on payslips.
::::

## Provisions {#payroll/payroll_localizations/provisions}

Provisions are the amounts computed by the employer to account for the
payments made to the employee for
`EOS (end-of-service)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} benefits or annual
leave. And it is computed on a monthly basis.

### End of service benefit provision

It is computed by dividing the end of service Provision Number of Days
by 12 and multiplying the result by the daily salary for the employee.

[$$\text{Payroll computation} = \frac{\text{Provision Number of Days}}{12} \times \frac{\text{Wage} + \text{Allowances}}{30}$$]{.overflow-scroll}

### Annual leave provision

It is computed by dividing the number of leave days by 12 and
multiplying the result by the daily salary for the employee.

[$$\text{Payroll computation} = \frac{\text{Number of Leave Days}}{12} \times \frac{\text{Wage} + \text{Allowances}}{30}$$]{.overflow-scroll}

## End of service {#payroll/payroll_localizations/end-of-service}

At the end of the service slip that is generated for the employee, there
are the following points that are unique only to the payslip:

### Unused leaves compensation

The number of available annual leaves is shown on the employee\'s
record. It is based on the annual leave type defined in the Payroll
settings. It is calculated as the total remaining allocations for that
specific leave type assigned to the employee.

That number is then multiplied by the daily rate for the employee and
added as an allowance on their payslip.

### End of service benefit

It is calculated by multiplying the daily wage of the employee by the
number of days for the end of service that is set in the employee\'s
contract.

[$$\text{Payroll computation} = \frac{\text{Wage + Allowances}}{30} \times \text{End of Service Number of Days}$$]{.overflow-scroll}

## Out of contract

Out-of-contract days are the days that fall within the payslip period
but are not included in the employee\'s contract period. The
corresponding amount is added as a deduction on the payslip and is
calculated by multiplying the number of out-of-contract days by the
employee\'s daily wage.

[$$\text{Payroll computation} = \frac{\text Wage + Allowances}{\text{Days in the Month}} \times \text{Out of Contract Days}$$]{.overflow-scroll}

# Employment Hero Payroll

The [Employment Hero](https://employmenthero.com/) module synchronises
payslip accounting entries (e.g., expenses, social charges, liabilities,
taxes) automatically from Employment Hero to Odoo. Payroll
administration is still done in Employment Hero, but the **journal
entries** are done in Odoo.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

KeyPay was rebranded as **Employment Hero** in March 2023.
::::

## Configuration {#employment_hero/configuration}

1.  `Activate <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
    `Employment Hero Payroll`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} module
    ([l10n_employment_hero]{.title-ref}).

2.  Configure the **Employment Hero API** by going to
    `Accounting --> Configuration
    --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. More fields
    become visible after clicking on `Enable Employment Hero
    Integration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

    ![Enabling Employment Hero Integration in Odoo Accounting displays new fields in the
    settings](employment_hero/employment-hero-integration.png)

    - The API Key can be found in the `My Account`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"} section of the Employment Hero platform.

      ![\"Account Details\" section on the Employment Hero dashboard](employment_hero/employment-hero-myaccount.png)

    - The **Payroll URL** is left empty by default to avoid any
      confusion. Please fill it according to the documentation specific
      to the localization.

    - Choose any Odoo journal to post the payslip entries.

3.  Configure the tax by going to
    `Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}. Create the necessary taxes for the Employment
    Hero payslip entries. Fill in the tax code from **Employment Hero**
    in the `Matching Employment Hero Tax`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field.

## How does the API work?

The API syncs the journal entries from Employment Hero to Odoo and
leaves them in draft mode. The reference includes the Employment Hero
payslip entry ID in brackets for the user to easily retrieve the same
record in Employment Hero and Odoo.

![Example of a Employment Hero Journal Entry in Odoo Accounting (Australia)](employment_hero/employment-hero-journal-entry.png)

By default, the synchronisation happens once per week. The records can
be fetched manually by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and, in the `Enable
Employment Hero Integration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option,
click on `Fetch Payruns Manually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Employment Hero payslip entries also work based on double-entry
bookkeeping.

The accounts used by Employment Hero are defined in the section
`Payroll settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Chart of Accounts menu in Employment Hero](employment_hero/employment-hero-chart-of-accounts.png)

For the API to work, create the same accounts as the default accounts of
the Employment Hero business (**same name and same code**) in Odoo. The
correct account types must be chosen in Odoo to generate accurate
financial reports.

## Generate payslips {#payroll/l10n_hk/running_payslips}

Once the employees, and their contracts, are configured, payslips can be
generated in the *Payroll* app.

Odoo provides **four** different salary structures under CAP57
regulation:

1.  `CAP57: Employees Monthly Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    to process the monthly employee salary.
2.  `CAP57: Payment in Lieu of Notice`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}: to process final payment upon contract termination
    using `ADW (Average Daily Wage)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
3.  `CAP57: Long Service Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    applicable to employees with more than five years of service upon
    contract termination.
4.  `CAP57: Severance Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    applicable to employees with more than two years of service upon
    contract termination.

Before running the payslips, the accounts used in the salary rule can be
adjusted by navigating to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Rules`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![Hong Kong Salary Rules.](hong_kong/hk-salary-rules.png)

Odoo can create pay runs in two ways: via
`batch <payroll/l10n_hk/batch_payslips>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
or `individual <payroll/l10n_hk/individual_payslips>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} payslips.

### Batch payslips {#payroll/l10n_hk/batch_payslips}

This method of payslip generation is used for recurring payments, since
multiple employee payslips can be managed at once. Go to
`Payroll app --> Payslips --> Batches`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

1.  Click on `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
2.  Enter a `Batch Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (e.g.
    [2024 - Jan]{.title-ref}) and `Period`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} (e.g. [01/01/2024]{.title-ref}
    -[01/31/2024]{.title-ref}).
3.  Click on `Generate Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
4.  Choose which `Salary Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    to use for this batch. The department filter allows the batch to
    only apply to a specific group of employees.
5.  Click on `Generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
6.  A `Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button is
    created automatically.

Next, click `Create Draft Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
generate a draft journal entry found in the
`Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of each payslip. A
`Confirmation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears
asking `Are you sure you want to proceed?`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Click `Ok`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
create the journal entries.

### Individual payslips {#payroll/l10n_hk/individual_payslips}

Go to `Payroll app --> Payslips --> All Payslips`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

This method of payslip generation is commonly used to handle
non-recurring payments (e.g.
`CAP57: Payment in Lieu of Notice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`CAP57: Long Service Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`CAP57: Severance Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

1.  Click on `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
2.  Select an `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. When
    selected, the `Contract`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
    filled out automatically.
3.  Add a pay `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
4.  Select a salary `Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (e.g.
    `CAP57: Employees Monthly Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).
5.  The `Worked Days & Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
    automatically compute the worked days/hours and time off leaves that
    are applicable.
6.  Additional payslip items can be added at this time (e.g.
    `Commissions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Deductions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) under the
    `Other Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.
7.  Click on `Compute Sheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
    to generate the payslip lines. This button updates the
    `Salary Computation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

If the work entry for an employee was amended, click the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(gear)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon, then click
`Recompute Whole Sheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to refresh
the payslip\'s `Worked Days &
Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
::::

The `Salary Computation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab shows
the detailed breakdown of the computation, based on the salary rules
configured for each structure type.

1.  `Rent Allowance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: amount derived
    from the employee\'s active rental record.
2.  `Basic Salary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: amount of base
    salary provided (after rent allowance deduction).
3.  `713 Gross`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: net payable amount
    considering *Commission*, *Internet Allowance*, *Reimbursements*,
    *Back-pay*, *Deduction*, etc.
4.  `MPF Gross`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: net payable amount
    from 713 gross after consideration of additional allowances,
    deductions, and end-of-year payment.
5.  `Employee Mandatory Contribution`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}: employee MPF Contribution.
6.  `Employer Mandatory Contribution`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}: employer MPF Contribution.
7.  `Gross`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: net payable amount from
    MPF gross after consideration of MPF deductions.
8.  `Net Salary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: final payable
    amount to be paid to the employee.

:::: important
::: title

There are no MPF contributions for the first month. Both employee and
employer contribution starts on second month.
::::

![Hong Kong Salary computation.](hong_kong/hk-salary-computation.png)

Under the `Other Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section in
`Worked Days & Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, there are
additional manual input types:

- `Back Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: additional salary
  payout can be included under this category.
- `Commission`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the commission earned
  during the period can be manually entered here.
- `Global Deduction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a lump-sum
  deduction from the entire payslip.
- `Global Reimbursement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a lump-sum
  reimbursement to the entire payslip.
- `Referral Fee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the additional
  bonus offered for any form of business-related referral.
- `Moving Daily Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to override
  the `ADW (Average Daily Wage)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} value
  used for leaves computation.
- `Skip Rent Allowance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if set, the
  rental allowance is excluded from the current payslip.
- `Custom Average Monthly Salary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to
  override the average monthly salary used for end-of-year payment (rule
  is only applicable to payslips generated in December).
- `Lieu of Notice Period (Months)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  only applicable to `CAP57: Payment in Lieu
  of Notice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} salary structure. By
  default, the final payout is set as 1-month. Use the
  `Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field under the
  `Other Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section to set a
  different notice period duration.

Once the payslips are ready, click on `Compute Sheet`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, followed by `Create Draft
entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to generate a draft journal
entry found in the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
of the payslip.

## Pay employees

Once the draft journal entries have been posted, the company can now pay
the employees. The user can choose between **two** different *payment
methods*:

- From the employee\'s payslip
  (`Payroll app --> Payslips --> All Payslips`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}), once the payslip\'s journal entry has been
  posted, click `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  The process is the same as
  `paying vendor bills <../../../finance/accounting/payments>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}. Select the desired bank journal and payment method, then
  later reconcile the payment with the corresponding bank statement.
- For batch payments
  (`Payroll app --> Payslips --> Batches`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}), once all draft journal entries from the batch
  are confirmed, click `Mark as Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  to post the payment journal entry. Then
  `create a payment <../../../finance/accounting/payments>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} in the *Accounting* app, and reconcile accordingly.

## Attendances and hourly wage

To configure the contract for an employee paid hourly using the
*Attendances* app for hours tracking, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Contracts --> Contracts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Create a new
`contract <payroll/l10n_hk/manage_contracts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. It is important to remember to set the
`Work Entry Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
`Attendances`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Wage Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
`Hourly Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To record the hours logged by the employee using *Attendances* app:

1.  Go to `Attendances app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
2.  The employee can check-in/out, via the kiosk mode and the time will
    be logged automatically.
3.  In the `Payroll app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, review
    the attendance work entries generated from
    `Payroll app --> Work Entries --> Work Entries`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
4.  Next, generate the
    `payslips <payroll/l10n_hk/running_payslips>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and process the payment.

![Hong Kong Attendance Work Entry.](hong_kong/hk-attendance-work-entry.png)

![Hong Kong Attendance Payslip.](hong_kong/hk-attendance-payslip.png)

## Time Off with Payroll

The work entry types and time off types are fully integrated between the
*Time Off* and *Payroll* apps. There are several default time off types
and work entry types specific to Hong Kong which are installed
automatically along with the *Hong Kong - Payroll* module.

Go to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Work Entry Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

There are two checkboxes to be considered when setting up the work entry
type:

- `Use 713`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Include this leave type
  as part of 713 computation.
- `Non-full pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: 80% of the
  `ADW (Average Daily Wage)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

::: seealso
`Creating and configuring work entry types <payroll/work-entry-types>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
:::

## Understanding 713 Ordinance

The *Hong Kong - Payroll* module is compliant with 713 Ordinance which
relates to the `ADW (Average Daily Wage)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
computation to ensure fair compensation for employees.

The ADW computation is as follows:

![`ADW (Average Daily Wage)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} equals the
total wage in a 12-month period, minus the wages of non-full pay,
divided by the total days in a 12-month period minus the days of
non-full pay.](hong_kong/hk-adw.png){alt="Hong Kong ADW Formula."}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

For 418 compliance, there is no automated allocation of the *Statutory
Holiday* entitlement to the employees. As soon as 418 requirements are
met, manually allocate the leaves, via the *Time Off* app.

:::: note

Before generating payslips, ensure the statuses are
`Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to validate the outcome.

::: example
Here is an example demonstrating the 713 logic:

- **Jan**: Generate a payslip with a monthly wage of \$20200. The
  `ADW (Average Daily Wage)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is always
  computed on a cumulative basis of the trailing 12-months.

- **Feb**: Generate a similar payslip, but add an
  `Other Input Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
  `Commission`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- **Mar**: Apply for **one** full-paid annual leave in March. The salary
  compensation for the leave taken is based on
  `ADW (Average Daily Wage)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} thus far.

  ![Hong Kong March 713.](hong_kong/hk-march-713.png)

- **Apr**: Apply for a 1-day non-full pay leave in April. Since this is
  a non-full pay leave, the `ADW (Average Daily Wage)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} is computed accordingly.

  ![Hong Kong April 713.](hong_kong/hk-apr-713.png)

#### Statutory compliance

##### Provident Fund (PF) Contribution {#payroll/epf}

The **EPF** is a retirement benefit scheme for employees, where both the
employer and employee contribute a fixed percentage of the employee\'s
salary each month.

The Provident Fund (PF) configuration option in Indian Payroll allows you to choose whether to:

:   - Cap Basic at ₹15,000 (as per EPF statutory rule), or
    - Calculate PF on the actual Basic (prorated wage) without cap.

##### Tax Deductions {#payroll/pt}

Tax Deductions allow companies to define statutory and employer-specific
tax deductions, such as Professional Tax and TDS, which are
automatically applied during payslip computation.

- Tax deductions are statutory or company-defined amounts subtracted
  from an employee\'s salary to comply with income tax and state tax
  regulations.
- The **Professional Tax** is a state-level tax levied on employees\'
  income.
- The system reads the employee\'s income and state from the contract
  and automatically applies the correct PT slab rate when generating
  payslips.

#### Salary benefits

Salary benefits such as phone and internet subscriptions, meal vouchers,
company transport, and medical insurance can be configured in employee
contracts as allowances or benefits, and they will be automatically
reflected in the employee\'s payslip.

Configure the **Benefits** and **Insurance Benefits** sections on the
contract, then set the monthly contribution amounts for each benefit.
Typical examples include:

- **Benefits**: Phone subscription, internet subscription, meal
  vouchers, company transport, and similar allowances.
- **Insurance Benefits**: Medical insurance, insured spouse, insured
  first child, insured second child, etc.

![Indian Benefits](india/in-benefits.png)

#### Other Deductions

Other Deductions include statutory items such as Gratuity.

Gratuity is a statutory employer contribution calculated as a percentage
of the employee\'s wage, accrued monthly as part of end-of-service
benefits.

![Other deduction section](india/in-other-deduction-section.png)

## Configure salary from contract template

Configure the Employee Salary page to automatically load and display
details based on the default contract template.

When creating a new employee, load the default contract template in the
`Employee Payroll`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to configure a
predefined salary package automatically.

![Load Indian Contract Template](india/in-contract-template-load.png)

The contract template defines the salary structure and includes all
applicable salary components, statutory compliances, and benefits.

To configure the contract template go to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Contract Templates`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, create or open an existing contract template,
then In the contract template, configure the salary package for the
applicant/employee, including the **Salary components**, **Statutory
compliances**, **Benefits** and **Insurance Benefits** described above.

> ![Indian Contract Template](india/in-contract-template.png)

## Time off Configuration

The Indian Localization for Time Off includes specific leave management
features designed for Indian organizations, such as
`Sandwich Leave <payroll/in_sandwich>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`Optional Holidays <payroll/in_optional>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Install the `India - Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
application to enable these policies.

::: seealso
`About Time Off <../../time_off>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

### Sandwich leave {#payroll/in_sandwich}

A *sandwich Leave* is a time off policy where weekends and public
holidays falling between two applied leave days are also counted as time
off. To enable this on a
`time off types <time_off/time-off-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
navigate to
`Time Off app --> Configuration --> Time Off Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click the desired time off type to enable
this feature on. Tick the checkbox next to
`Sandwich Leave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
`Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form.

::: example
An employee applies for leave on Friday November 28th and Monday
December 1st. Both Saturday November 29th and Sunday November 30th (the
weekend) are also counted as time off, making the total time off
requested **four** days *not* **two** days.
:::

### Optional holidays {#payroll/in_optional}

Optional Holidays, also called *Flexible Holidays* are special holidays
assigned to specific calendar dates, such as regional or religious
holidays. Employees may apply for leave only on these defined dates.

If an employee attempts to request leave on any other date, a validation
error will be raised.

To enable this on a
`time off types <time_off/time-off-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
navigate to
`Time Off app --> Configuration --> Time Off Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and create a new time off type or open an
existing one, Tick the checkbox next to
`Limited to Optional Holiday`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
`Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form. Then, go to
`Time Off app --> Configuration --> Optional Holidays`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Create new optional holidays by assigning them to
specific calendar dates The optional holiday can be seen on the
dashboard

Employees can request these leave types, but only on the configured
optional (flexible) holiday dates.

## Payroll configuration

When the **l10n_in_hr_payroll** module is
`installed <payroll/indian_apps>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, a new
salary structure for India is added:
`India: Regular Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under the
`India: Employee Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} structure type.

The salary structure contains all salary rules needed to calculate
wages, statutory salary structure, allowances, deductions, and
compliance rules.

### Salary rules

The salary rules control how each allowance, deduction, benefit, and
statutory compliances is calculated.

To view the salary rules, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Structures`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click on `India: Employee Pay`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to expand it, and then click
`India: Regular Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Indian Regular Pay](india/in-regular-pay-structure.png)

### Rule parameters

Certain payroll calculations require specific rates or wage caps, and
Rule Parameters provide values either as percentages or fixed amounts
that can be referenced in salary rules.

Rule parameters can be accessed via
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Rule Parameters`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. All the Rule parameters will be listed here with
the associated salary rules.

Rule parameters are used by salary rules for statutory calculations,
ensuring that payslips stay compliant with national and state-level
regulations.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo updates rule parameters as needed. It is recommended **not to
modify** rule parameters unless there is an official change in national
or state regulations.
::::

## Run India Payroll

Before running payroll, the payroll officer must validate employee
`work entries
<../work_entries>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to confirm pay accuracy
and catch any errors. This includes ensuring that all time off is
approved, any overtime is appropriate.

Work entries are synchronized based on the employee\'s
`contract <../contracts>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} configuration.
Odoo pulls from the assigned working schedule, attendance records,
planning schedule, and approved time off.

Any `discrepancies or conflicts <payroll/conflicts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} must be resolved, then the work entries can be
`regenerated <payroll/regenerate-work-entries>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Once everything is correct, draft payslips can be `created individually
<payroll/process>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or in
`groups <../pay_runs>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, referred to in the
Payroll app as Pay Runs.

![The work entries for a pay run, with some time off entered in the work entries.](india/in-work-entries.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To cut down on the payroll officer\'s time, it is typical to process
payslips in batches, either by wage type (fixed salary vs hourly), pay
schedule (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.), department (direct cost vs.
administration), or any other grouping that best suits the company.
::::

The process of running payroll includes different actions that need to
be executed to ensure that the amount withheld from payroll taxes is
correct, the amount that the employee receives as their net salary is
correct, and the computation of hours worked reflects the employee\'s
actual hours worked, among others.

When running a payroll batch, check that the period, company, and
employees included are correct *before* starting to analyze or validate
the data.

Once the payslips are drafted, review them for accuracy. Check the
`Worked Days & Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and
ensure the listed worked time is correct, as well as any other inputs.
Add any missing inputs, such as commissions, tips, reimbursements, that
are missing.

Next, check the various totals (gross pay, employee taxes, benefits,
employer taxes, net salaries), then click
`Compute Sheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to update the salary
calculations, if there were edits. If everything is correct, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The worked days tab of a payslip.](india/in-check-payslips.png)

### Accounting check

The accounting process when running payroll has two components:
`creating journal entries
<payroll/in-journal>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
`registering payments <payroll/in-register>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

#### Journal entry creation {#payroll/in-journal}

After payslips are confirmed and validated, journal entries are posted
either individually, or in a batch. The journal entry is created first
as a draft.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

It must be decided if journal entries are done individually or in
batches *before* running payroll.
::::

![All payslips in a draft state.](india/in-draft-payslip.png)

Six accounts from the India `CoA (Chart of Accounts)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} are included with the India payroll localization:

- \`210100 Salary Expense\`: Records the gross salary expense for
  employees, including the basic pay and any earnings not allocated to
  specific allowance accounts. This account captures the main salary
  cost for financial reporting.
- \`300001 House Rent Allowance Expense\`: Records the portion of salary
  paid as House Rent Allowance. Used to track HRA separately for
  statutory reporting and tax computation purposes.
- \`300002 Standard Allowance Expense\`: Records recurring allowances
  that are part of the salary package but do not fall under special
  categories like HRA or performance bonus. Examples include transport
  or utility allowances.
- \`300005 Performance Bonus\`: Records discretionary or
  performance-linked bonuses paid to employees. This account helps
  separate one-time or variable incentive costs from regular salary
  expenses.
- \`300011 Leave Travel Allowance Expense\`: Tracks Leave Travel
  Allowance paid to employees. LTA is often partially tax-exempt under
  Indian Income Tax rules, so tracking it separately is important for
  compliance.
- \`300004 Fixed Allowance Expense\`: Records fixed, recurring
  allowances paid to employees such as meal allowances, special duty
  allowances, or any other structured component of the salary.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `CoA (Chart of Accounts)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
configuration is set up by default when a company is located in India.
The account codes and names can be customized to match the company\'s
salary structure and reporting requirements. If a salary rule (used in a
salary structure) does not have an associated
`CoA (Chart of Accounts)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} account, Odoo
will use the default account [Salary Expense]{.title-ref} to create the
journal entry, regardless of the type of move.
::::

Once the journal entry draft appears correct, post the journal entries.

![Journal entries posted.](india/in-done-payslip.png)

### Register Payments {#payroll/in-register}

After the `journal entries <payroll/in-journal>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are validated, Odoo can generate payments.

Payments can be `Grouped by Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
if there is a partner associated with a salary rule.

![Payslips with a status of paid.](india/in-paid-payslip.png)

### Close Payroll

If there are no errors, payroll is completed for the pay period.

## Understanding the Indian Payslip

This payslip provides detailed information on allowances, deductions,
compliance requirements, and benefits. It helps employees understand how
their salary is calculated, the statutory and organizational deductions
applied, and the benefits they are entitled to, ensuring transparency
and trust in the payroll process.

::: seealso
`Create a Payslip <../payslips>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

![Indian Salary Payslip](india/in-payslip.png)

## Payroll reports

The Indian payroll localization includes payslip-related reports and
statutory compliance reports, including:

- `Salary Register <payroll/in_salary_register>`{.interpreted-text

Before configuring the Jordan localization, refer to the general
`payroll <../../payroll>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} documentation,
which includes the basic information for all localizations, as well as
all universal settings and fields.

::: seealso
`Jordan fiscal localization documentation <../../../finance/fiscal_localizations/jordan>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## General configurations

First, the company must be configured. Navigate to
`Settings app --> Users &
Companies --> Companies`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. From
the list, select the desired company, and configure the following
fields:

- `Company Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the business
  name in this field.

- `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Complete the full
  address, including the `City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Zip
  Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  Jordan does not use the `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  field, this remains blank. The `Zip Code`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} refers to the Jordanian [Postal Code]{.title-ref}.
  ::::

- `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the company\'s tax
  identification number.

- `Company ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} : Enter the
  business\'s registry number.

- `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: By default,
  `JOD (Jordanian Dollars)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is selected.
  If not, select `JOD`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
  drop-down menu.

## Employees

Every employee being paid must have their employee profiles configured
for the Jordan payroll localization. Additional fields are present after
configuring the database for Jordan.

To update an employee form, open the `Employees`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} app and click on the desired employee record. On
the employee form, configure the required fields in the related tabs.

### Work tab

Enter the `Work Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
employee in the `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of
the `Work`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

### Personal tab

Ensure the employee has a minimum of one
`trusted bank account <employees/private-contact>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} listed in the `Bank Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field in the `Private Contact`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section.

These accounts are used to pay the employee. Payroll **cannot** be
processed for employees without a *trusted*
`bank account <employees/private-contact>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. If no trusted bank account is set, a warning appears on the
**Payroll** dashboard and an error occurs when attempting to run
payroll.

If the employee is **not** a resident of Jordan, tick the
`Non-resident`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box. This indicates
the employee is *not* eligible for personal exemptions.

Under the `Family`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, ensure
the `Has Dependants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box is ticked if
the employee has any dependants, such as a spouse, children, or parents.
This ensures they receive an additional exemption on their taxable
salary.

By default, the `Is Eligible for EOS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox is ticked, in the `Personal
Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, indicating the
employee is eligible for end of service benefits. If the employee is
**not** eligible, ensure the box is unchecked.

Additionally, if the employee is blind, tick the
`Is Blind`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox. This ensures the
employee\'s entire salary is tax-exempt.

### Payroll tab

#### Contract overview section

This section holds information that drives salary calculations. Ensure
the following fields are configured:

- `Contract`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Ensure the contract
  dates are populated. The contract start date populates the first
  field, and if the contract has a set end date, that is populated in
  the second field.

- `Wage Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select how the
  employee is paid.

#### Schedule section

- `Work Entry Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Defines how
  `work entries <../work_entries>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} are
  generated for payroll during the specified pay period. The options
  are:
  - `Working Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Based on the
    employee\'s assigned `working schedule
    <employees/schedule>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} (e.g., 40 hours
    per week).
  - `Attendances`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Based on
    `approved checked-in hours
    <../../attendances/management>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} in the
    **Attendances** app.
  - `Planning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Based on

- `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  drop-down menu, select `Jordan Working Schedule`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, which consists of a Sunday - Thursday, 40-hour work
  week.

#### Allowances section

The following sections of benefits are considered common ones offered by
Jordanian employers. This information needs to be populated with the
information selected by the employee.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The benefits listed in this section are considered the ones most
commonly offered by companies. If other employee benefits exist that
require regular paycheck deductions, they can be added as *inputs*.
::::

Enter the monthly allowance amount for `Housing`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Transportation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and `Other`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} allowances.

If the employee is tax exempt, enter the annual amount that is not
subject to taxes in the `Tax Exemption`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

If the employee\'s salary is based on commission, tick the
`Is Commission based`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

#### Annual leave provision section

Every year, employees receive days off. Enter the number of days in the
`Number of Leave
days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. The default value is 14.

## Social Insurance

Social insurance rules calculate the contribution amounts that are to be
paid by the employer and employee to the
`Social Security Corporation (SSC)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. This
is only available for Jordanian employees.

The employer contributes 14.25% of the employee\'s salary to the
`Social Security Corporation
(SSC)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, while the employee contributes
7.5% of their salary, which is deducted from their payslip.

For both employer and employee contributions, the base amount on which
they are calculated is bound by a cap that gets updated every year.

## Leaves

The following leave types are available to employees working in Jordan:

- `Annual leave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Employee\'s are
  eligible for 21 days of annual leave, and if the employee requires
  more days, they have to be requested from HR managers accordingly.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Since the annual leave is fully paid, it is not connected to a salary
rule, but it will appear on the worked days on the payslip form and on
the PDF printout.
::::

- `Sick leave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Employee\'s working
  in Jordan are entitled to 14 days of paid sick leave per year, with
  the possibility of an additional 14 days if hospitalized. No
  deductions are applied to the employee in those cases.
- `Other leave types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: These leave
  types are fully paid and do not affect the final payslip, but are
  tracked for reporting purposes:
  - `Maternity leave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `Paternity Leave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `Pilgrimage Leave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  - `Study leave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

## Income Tax

In Jordan, employees are subject to a progressive income tax system,
where tax rates increase with higher annual income brackets.

### Tax brackets

Depending on the annual income of the employee, the following rates
apply:

  Taxable Bracket   Range
  ----------------- ---------------------
  5%                0-5,000
  10%               5,001 - 10,000
  15%               10,001 - 15,000
  20%               15,001 - 20,000
  25%               20,001 - 1,000,000
  30%               More than 1,000,000

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Tax brackets are applied progressively. This means each portion of an
employee\'s income is taxed at its respective rate within each bracket,
rather than their entire income being taxed at the rate of the highest
bracket they fall into.
::::

### Exemptions

Several factors contribute to exempting part of an employee\'s gross
income, including:

- **Jordanian residency**: Residents are entitled to a yearly exemption
  of 12,000 JOD.
- **Blindness**: Individuals who are blind are **fully** exempt from
  income tax.
- **Dependents**: An additional 12,000 JOD exemption per year for
  employees with dependents.

## Overtime

Employees are entitled to additional pay for overtime worked, depending
on when the overtime hours are worked:

- On working days: Overtime is paid at 1.25 times the regular hourly
  wage.
- On rest days: Overtime is compensated at 1.5 times the regular hourly
  wage.

These percentages are recorded in the input parameters model.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The number of overtime hours is registered as other inputs directly on
payslips.
::::

## Provisions

Provisions are the amounts computed by the employer to account for the
payments made to the employee for
`end-of-service (EOS)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} benefits or annual
leaves. It is computed on a monthly basis.

- **End of service benefit provision**: This is computed by dividing the
  monthly gross salary by 12

  $$\frac{\text{Basic} + \text{Allowances}}{12}$$

- **Annual leave provision**: This is computed by dividing the gross
  salary by 30 to get the daily salary, then multiplying that by the
  number of leave days, and dividing the result by 12.

  $$\left(\frac{\text{Basic} + \text{Allowances}}{30}\right)
  \times
  \left(\frac{\text{Number of Leave Days}}{12}\right)$$

## End of Service

At the end of the employee\'s service, if they are eligible for
end-of-service benefits, they should receive the following two benefits:

- **Unused leaves compensation**: The Annual Leave Balance is shown on
  the employee\'s record. It is based on the annual leave type defined
  in the **Payroll** app settings and is calculated as the total
  remaining allocations for that specific leave type assigned to the
  employee.

  The balance represents the total remaining leave allocated to the
  employee but does not reflect the portion of leave days the employee
  has earned up to the current month.

  When calculating the benefit value, the deserved leave balance is
  determined based on the portion of the year worked. The benefit value
  is then calculated by multiplying this deserved balance by the
  employee\'s daily rate.

  ::: example
  If an employee is entitled to 14 leave days per year and has worked
  for 6 months, they deserve 7 leave days so far. If their daily rate is
  50 JOD, the benefit value is: 7 days × 50 JOD = 350 JOD
  :::

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  The flow mentioned above requires the allocation for the annual leave
  to be given fully upfront in the beginning of the year for that
  employee
  ::::

- **End of Service Benefit**: The calculation begins by determining the
  total number of days the employee has worked at the company, starting
  from their joining date up to their last working day.

  The total service duration is calculated out of a 365-day year.

  The resulting period in years is then multiplied by the employee\'s
  gross salary, which includes the basic salary and the allowances
  defined in the payroll tab on the employee record.

  $$(\text{Basic} + \text{Allowances}) \times \left(\frac{\text{Number of Days}}{365}\right)$$

## Payroll configuration

Several sections within the **Payroll** app installs a Salary Structure,
Structure Type, Rules, and Parameters specific to Jordan.

### Salary structures & structure types

When the **l10n_jo_hr_payroll** module is
`installed <payroll/jordan_apps>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, a new
`Salary Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} gets installed,
`Jordan: Monthly Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This structure
includes one `Structure Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Jordan: Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The `Salary Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} contains all
the individual `salary rules
<payroll/jordan_apps>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} that informs the
**Payroll** app how to calculate employee payslips.

![The United States salary structure in the salary structures list.](jordan/jo-structure-types.png)

### Salary rules {#payroll/jordan_rules}

To view the salary rules that inform the salary structure what to do,
navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Structures`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and expand the `Jordan:
Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} entry to reveal the
`Jordan: Monthly Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} structure type.
Click `Jordan: Monthly Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to view
the detailed salary rules.

![The top portion of the US salary rules.](jordan/jo-rules-top-half.png)

Each rule defines how pay is calculated, taking into account factors
such as allowances, deductions, and taxes.

### Rule parameters

Some calculations require specific rates associated with them, or wage
caps. *Rules Parameters* are capable of listing a value, either a
percentage or a fixed amount, to reference in the salary rules.

::: example
The percentage rate for employee Social Security deductions is set in
the [Jordan Social Security Employee Deduction Rate %]{.title-ref}
parameter.
:::

Most rules pull information stored in the parameters module to get the
rate of the rule (a percentage) and the cap (a dollar amount).

To view rule parameters, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Rule
Parameters`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Here, all rule
parameters are displayed with their linked
`Salary Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which can be
accessed. Review the parameters associated with a rule by looking for
the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the rule, and make any
edits as needed.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo adds updated rule parameters for the current calendar year. It is
**not** recommended to edit rule parameters **unless a national
parameter has changed**, and is different from the rule parameters
created by Odoo. Check with all national regulations *before* making any
changes to rule parameters.
::::

## Run Jordan payroll

Before running payroll, the payroll officer must validate employee
`work entries
<../work_entries>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to confirm pay accuracy
and catch errors. This includes checking that all time off is approved
and any overtime is appropriate.

Work entries sync based on the employee\'s
`contract <../contracts>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} configuration.
Odoo pulls from the assigned working schedule, attendance records,
planning schedule, and approved time off.

Any `discrepencies or conflicts <payroll/conflicts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} must be resolved, then the work entries can be
`regenerated <payroll/regenerate-work-entries>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Once everything is correct, draft payslips can be
`created individually <payroll/process>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
or in `groups <../pay_runs>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, referred to
in the **Payroll** app as *Pay Runs*.

![The work entries for a pay run, with some time off entered in the work entries.](jordan/jo-work-entries.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To cut down on the payroll officer\'s time, it is typical to process
payslips in batches, either by wage type (fixed salary vs hourly), pay
schedule (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.), department (direct cost vs.
administration), or any other grouping that best suits the company.
::::

The process of running payroll includes different actions that need to
be executed to ensure that the amount withheld from payroll taxes is
correct, the amount that the employee receives as their net salary is
correct, and the computation of hours worked reflects the employee\'s
actual hours worked, among others.

When running a payroll batch, check that the period, company, and
employees included are correct *before* starting to analyze or validate
the data.

Once the payslips are drafted, review them for accuracy. Check the
`Worked Days & Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and
ensure the listed worked time is correct, as well as any other inputs.
Add any missing inputs, such as commissions, tips, reimbursements, that
are missing.

Next, check the various totals (gross pay, employee taxes, benefits,
employer taxes, net salaries), then click
`Compute Sheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to update the salary
calculations, if there were edits. If everything is correct, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The worked days tab of a payslip.](jordan/jo-check-payslips.png)

### Accounting check

The accounting process when running payroll has two components:
`creating journal entries
<payroll/jo-journal>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
`registering payments <payroll/jo-register>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

#### Journal entry creation {#payroll/jo-journal}

After payslips are confirmed and validated, journal entries are posted
either individually, or in a batch. The journal entry is created first
as a draft.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

It must be decided if journal entries are done individually or in
batches *before* running payroll.
::::

![All payslips in a draft state.](jordan/jo-draft.png)

Thirteen accounts from the Jordan
`CoA (Chart of Accounts)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are included
with the Jordan payroll localization:

- \`500301 Basic Salary\`: Tracks the basic wages paid to employees.
- \`500302 Housing Allowance\`: Captures housing allowance payments
  provided to employees.
- \`500303 Transportation Allowance\`: Captures transportation allowance
  payments to employees.
- \`500308 Staff Other Allowances\`: Covers employee allowances that do
  not fit any other available categories.
- \`500310 Salary Deductions\`: Reflects deductions applied to employee
  salaries (e.g., advances, fines, statutory deductions).
- \`500305 Leave Salary\`: Records salaries actually paid to employees
  while on paid leave.
- \`201022 Social Security Payable\`: Holds both employee and employer
  amounts payable for social insurance contributions.
- \`200502 Leave Days Provision\`: Accrues the cost of paid leave; the
  balance is reduced when leave is taken, and any leave not taken may be
  paid out when the employee leaves the company.
- \`200503 End of Service Provision\`: Accumulates the end-of-service
  benefit monthly, so the amount can be paid (partially or fully) when
  the employee leaves, per service length and reason.
- \`200101 Payables\`: Shows amounts payable to employees as salaries
  (unpaid salary liability at period end).
- \`500202 End of Service Indemnity\`: Captures company expenses set
  aside to fund end-of-service benefits (expense-side counterpart to the
  provision).
- \`200307 Employee Income Tax\`: Accumulates the income tax amount
  withheld from the employee\'s salary.
- \`500311 Social Security Expenses\`: Captures The total expense amount
  from payments to the social insurance authority.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `CoA (Chart of Accounts)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
configuration is done by default when installing the Jordan payroll
localization. The account codes and names can be edited to suit the
company\'s needs.
::::

If everything seems correct on the journal entry draft, post the journal
entries.

![Journal entries posted.](jordan/jo-done.png)

### Register Payments {#payroll/jo-register}

After the `journal entries <payroll/journal>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are validated, Odoo can generate payments.

Payments can be `Grouped by Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
if there is a partner associated with a salary rule.

![Payslips with a status of paid.](jordan/jo-paid.png)

### Close Payroll

If there are no errors, payroll is completed for the pay period.

## Reports

No additional payroll reports unique to the Jordan payroll localization
exist. All reports are the standard preconfigured reports included with
the **Payroll** app.

- `Contract`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The time period the
  contract is valid for. If the second field is left blank, the contract
  runs indefinitely.

- `Wage Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select how the
  employee is paid.

  - Select `Fixed Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for salaried
    employees who receive the same amount each pay period.
  - Select `Hourly Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
    employees paid based on hours worked.

  :::: tip
  ::: title
  Tip
  :::

  Set a default `Wage Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
  salary `Structure Type
  <payroll/structure-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to configure
  employees in bulk. If needed, the default can be overridden on
  individual employee records if exceptions are needed.
  ::::

- `Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the amount and
  frequency the employee is paid.

- `Contract Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Determines how the
  employee is paid and classified, such as
  `Indefinite Term Employment Contract`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Hourly Wage Employment`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Seasonal Employment Contract`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.

  :::: important
  ::: title

  :::

  The `Contract Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
  visible on payslips.
  ::::

- `Pay Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
  `Mexico: Employee.`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for this field.
  This defines when the employee is paid, their default working
  schedule, and the work entry type it applies to.

- `Regime Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the correct
  regime type (Régimen de Contratación) for the employee. The selected
  regime type determines the employee\'s benefits, taxes, and social
  security contributions.

#### Schedule section

- `Work Entry Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
  `Working Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which creates
  `work
  entries <../work_entries>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} based on the
  employee\'s assigned `working schedule
  <employees/schedule>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} (e.g., 40 hours
  per week).

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  The Mexico payroll localization is currently not able to create work
  entries from the **Attendances** or **Planning** apps.
  ::::

- `Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick the checkbox to
  allow the **Attendances** app to add any extra work entries logged by
  the employee.

- `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  drop-down menu, select the default work schedule. This is particularly
  important for employees available to receive overtime pay (typically
  hourly employees, not salaried).

#### Options section

Enter the `Holiday Bonus Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
percentage given annually ot the employee in the corresponding field.
The percentage is calculated from the employee\'s base salary.

If the employee is contributing to a `Savings Fund`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, enter the monthly amount to be contributed. The
employer typically matches this amount, and the money is placed in a
savings account that is accessible once a year to the employee.

#### Vouchers section

Some companies may offer extra benefits in the form of vouchers, which
are paid to employees for food and transportation costs. If the company
provides these benefits, configure the following fields:

- `Payment Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  drop-down menu, select how often the vouchers are paid out. The
  default options are either `Last Day of the Month`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, if employees are paid at the end of the month, or
  `In the period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, if the vouchers
  are broken up and evenly distributed according to the payment
  schedule, such as weekly or bi-weekly.
- `Meal Vouchers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the monthly
  amount paid to the employee towards food expenses.
- `Transport Vouchers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  monthly amount paid to the employee towards transportation, such as
  bus fare or parking fees.
- `Gasoline Vouchers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  monthly amount paid to the employee for their vehicle\'s gas.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The monetary amount for the vouchers is the *monthly amount* given to
employees. If the `Payment Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
set to `In the period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, Odoo
calculates the voucher amount for each pay period.

For example, if an employee is paid weekly, and their
`Meal Voucher`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to \$100, the
employee receives \$25 in every weekly paycheck.

### Infonavit / Fonacot tab

#### Infonavit section

`INFONAVIT (Instituto del Fondo Nacional de la Vivienda para los Trabajadores)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is a government institution that assists employees with
affordable mortgage credits, which can be used to buy, build, or remodel
a home, or pay off an existing mortgage.

##### Add an Infonavit credit

To create an
`INFONAVIT (Instituto del Fondo Nacional de la Vivienda para los Trabajadores)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} credit, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and a `Create an Infonavit Credit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window loads.

By default, the `Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
populated with `In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This
indicates the credit is active.

Next, select the `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of credit,
either a `Fixed Monetary Fee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
`Percentage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or a
`Discount Factor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. After this field
is configured, a corresponding field appears on the form.

Enter the `Monthly Insurance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to be
paid directly to the debt. If any additional funds are contributed by
the employee, enter the additional amount in the `Extra Fixed Monthly
Contribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

The last field corresponds to the `Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} selected. Enter the `Fixed Monetary
Fee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Percentage`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Discount Factor`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the field.

Once all fields are configured, click the
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and the credit
is added to the
`INFONAVIT (Instituto del Fondo Nacional de la Vivienda para los Trabajadores)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} section.

Once
`INFONAVIT (Instituto del Fondo Nacional de la Vivienda para los Trabajadores)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} credits are fully paid, the payroll officer **must** change
the `Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of each completed line
item to `Closed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If the payroll officer does **not** change the status, money will
continue to be contributed to the employee\'s account in all subsequent
paychecks.
::::

#### Fonacot section

`FONACOT (Fondo Nacional para el Consumo de los Trabajadores)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is a Mexican government program that provides employees
with low-cost loans for various needs, such as home improvements,
education, or emergencies.

The
`FONACOT (Fondo Nacional para el Consumo de los Trabajadores)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} section is where employee repayments are configured.

##### Add a Fonacot credit

To add a line to the
`FONACOT (Fondo Nacional para el Consumo de los Trabajadores)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} section, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and a blank line loads. The `Status`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is set to `In
Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, by default.

Enter the monthly payment amount in the `Import`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. If the employee wishes to make any additional
payments each month, enter the value in the
`Extra Monthly Contribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: important

Once
`FONACOT (Fondo Nacional para el Consumo de los Trabajadores)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} loans are paid off, the payroll officer **must** change the
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of each completed line item
to `Closed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If the payroll officer does **not** change the status, money will
continue to be taken out of the employee\'s account in all subsequent
paychecks.
::::

## Payroll configuration

Several sections within the **Payroll** app installs a *salary
structure*, *structure type*, *rules*, and *rule parameters* specific to
Mexico.

Prior to running payroll, the
`CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} must also be configured.

### CFDI configuration

The `CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is a **required** electronic tax receipt that acts as a
digital invoice. The
`CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} **must** be certified by a
`PAC (Authorized Certification Provider)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
*before* being submitted to the Mexican Tax Administration
(`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}).

This document serves as proof of income, expenses, and payroll, and
requires both a `UUID
(Universally Unique Identifier)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and a
digital signature, to comply with Mexican tax laws.

First, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and scroll to the `CFDI`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section.

Enter the `Employer IMSS ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
corresponding field, and select the appropriate
`Risk Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} using the drop-down menu.
If no risk is associated with the company, select
`Does Not Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Mexico assigns different `Risk Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
based on several factors, including information cross-referenced from
previously submitted employee and employer. Consult the company\'s
payroll officer to determine the correct risk type.
::::

### Salary structures & structure types

When the **l10n_mx_hr_payroll** module is
`installed <payroll/mexico_apps>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, a new
`Salary Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} gets installed,
`Mexico: Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This structure
includes two `Structure Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
`Mexico: Regular Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a `Mexico:
Christmas Bonus`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The `Salary Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} contains all
the individual `salary rules
<payroll/mexico_rules>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for each
`Structure Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which informs the
**Payroll** app how to calculate employee payslips.

![The Mexico salary structures in the salary structures list.](mexico/structure-types.png)

### Salary rules {#payroll/mexico_rules}

To view the salary rules that inform the salary structure what to do,
navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Structures`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and expand the `Mexico:
Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} group to reveal the two
available structure types. Click `Mexico: Regular Pay`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to view the detailed regular pay salary rules.

![The top portion of the US salary rules.](mexico/mx-rules-top-half.png)

Each rule defines how pay is calculated, taking into account factors
such as bonuses, allowances, vouchers, and taxes.

### Rule parameters

Some calculations require specific rates associated with them, such as
bonuses and holidays. *Rule Parameters* are capable of listing a value,
either a percentage or a fixed amount, to reference in the salary rules.

Most rules pull information stored in the parameters module to get the
rate of the rule (a percentage) and the cap (a dollar amount).

To view rule parameters, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Rule
Parameters`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Here, all rule
parameters are displayed with their linked
`Salary Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which can be
accessed. Review the parameters associated with a rule by looking for
the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the rule, and make any
edits as needed.

In Mexico, all companies are **required** to configure the following
rule parameters:

- `Mexico: Risk Bonus Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (Prima de
  Riesgo del IMSS): The `Risk Bonus Rate`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} is referred to as the *Occupational Risk Premium
  (Prima de Riesgo de Trabajo)*. This is the amount the company must
  contribution to the
  `IMSS (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"}, aka the *Mexican Social Security Institute*. This amount
  is based on the company\'s *accident rate*, which is calculated using
  multiple factors, including the number of accidents the company has
  reported, and the general level of risk the type of company works
  with. The rate is determined by the
  `IMSS (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} for each company, therefore this rate **must** be updated
  when configuring the Mexico payroll localization.
- `Mexico: Christmas Bonus`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (Días de
  Aguinaldo): In Mexico, an annual Christmas bonus is given to all
  employees. The bonus must be for a minimum of 15 days of pay.
  Companies that provide a higher bonus **must** modify this value. In
  Odoo, all employees of a company recieve the same amout of paid days
  for their Chirstmas bonus.
- `Mexico: Holiday Table`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (Tabla de
  vacaciones): This rule outlines the number of vacation days an
  employee is allocated, based on their years of service. This **must**
  be modified, if needed, to reflect the company\'s paid vacation
  policy.

::: example
The `Mexico: Risk Bonus Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of a
company is different from the one added by default in Odoo. To update
this, navigate to `Payroll app --> Configuration --> Rule
Parameters`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, then, filter the
results by `Mexico: Risk Bonus Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and edit the `Parameter Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
:::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo adds updated rule parameters for the current calendar year. It is
**not** recommended to edit rule parameters (other than the four that
must be reviewed and updated, listed above) **unless a national or state
parameter has changed**, and is different from the rule parameters
created by Odoo. Check with all local and national regulations *before*
making any changes to rule parameters.
::::

## Run Mexico payroll {#payroll/run_mexico}

Before running payroll, the payroll officer must validate employee
`work entries
<../work_entries>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to confirm pay accuracy
and catch errors. This includes checking that all time off is approved
and any overtime is appropriate.

Work entries sync based on the employee\'s
`contract <../contracts>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} configuration.
Odoo pulls from the assigned working schedule, attendance records,
planning schedule, and approved time off.

Any `discrepencies or conflicts <payroll/conflicts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} must be resolved, then the work entries can be
`regenerated <payroll/regenerate-work-entries>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Once everything is correct, draft payslips can be
`created individually <payroll/process>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
or in `groups <../pay_runs>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, referred to
in the **Payroll** app as *Pay Runs*.

![The work entries for a pay run, with some time off entered in the work entries.](mexico/mexico-work-entries.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To cut down on the payroll officer\'s time, it is typical to process
payslips in batches, either by wage type (fixed salary vs hourly), pay
schedule (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.), department (direct cost vs.
administration), or any other grouping that best suits the company.
::::

The process of running payroll includes different actions that need to
be executed to ensure that the amount withheld for funds and government
institutions is correct, the amount that the employee receives as their
net salary is correct, and the computation of hours worked reflects the
employee\'s actual hours worked, among others.

When running a payroll batch, check that the period, company, and
employees included are correct *before* starting to analyze or validate
the data.

Once the payslips are drafted, review them for accuracy. Check the
`Worked Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Salary Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tabs, and ensure the
listed worked time is correct, as well as any other inputs. Add any
missing inputs, such as commissions, bonuses, and
`ISR (Impuesto Sobre la
Renta)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} adjustments that are missing.

Next, check the various totals (gross pay, vouchers, IMSS contributions,
`CEAV (Cesantía en
Edad Avanzada y Vejez)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, taxes, and gross
pay), then click `Compute Sheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
update the salary calculations, if there were edits. If everything is
correct, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The worked days tab of a payslip.](mexico/check-payslips.png)

### Accounting check

The accounting process when running payroll has two components:
`creating journal entries
<payroll/journal-mx>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
`registering payments <payroll/register-mx>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

#### Journal entry creation {#payroll/journal-mx}

After payslips are confirmed and validated, journal entries are posted
either individually, or in a batch. The journal entry is created first
as a draft.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

It must be decided if journal entries are done individually or in
batches *before* running payroll.
::::

![All payslips in a draft state.](mexico/create-draft-entry.png)

Twenty-two accounts from the Mexico
`CoA (Chart of Accounts)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are included
with the payroll localization:

- `110.01.01 Employment subsidy to apply`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `210.02.01 Provision for vacation to pay`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `211.01.01 Provision for employer IMSS to pay`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `211.02.01 Provision for SAR to pay`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `216.01.01 Withholding or income tax for wages and salaries`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `216.11.01 IMSS withholding tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `601.01.01 Wages and salaries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `601.07.01 Holiday Bonus`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `601.15.01 Pantry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `601.19.01 Savings fund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `601.26.01 IMSS quota`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `601.27.01 Contributions to infonavit`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `601.28.01 Contributions to the SAR`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `201.01.02 Employee Reimbursement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `205.06.02 Other Various Short-Term Credits (Fonacot)`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `210.03.01 Provision for bonus to pay`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `210.04.01 Provision for savings fund to pay`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `211.03.01 Provision for infonavit to pay`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `601.12.01 Bonus`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `601.16.02 Transport (gasoline vouchers)`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `601.16.01 Transport (support)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `601.74.01 Commissions on sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `CoA (Chart of Accounts)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
configuration is done by default when a company is located in Mexico.
The account codes and names can be edited to suit the company\'s needs.
If there is no `CoA (Chart of Accounts)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
account associated with a salary rule (used in a salary structure), Odoo
uses the account [Salary Expenses]{.title-ref} to create the journal
entry, regardless of the nature of the move.
::::

If everything seems correct on the journal entry draft, post the journal
entries.

![Journal entries posted.](mexico/post-entries.png)

### Register Payments {#payroll/register-mx}

After the `journal entries <payroll/journal-mx>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are validated, Odoo can generate payments.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To generate payments from payslips,employee\'s **must** have a *trusted*
bank account. If the employee\'s bank account is *not* marked as
[trusted]{.title-ref}, CFDI files **cannot** be generated through Odoo.
::::

![Payslips with a status of paid.](mexico/paid.png)

### Generate CFDI XML files

After payslips have bee processed and paid, a
`CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} XML file must be generated, which is then electronically
submitted to Mexico\'s `SAT (Servicio
de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

To create the
`CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} file, open the individual payslip, and click the
`Generate CFDI`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

Once the file has been created and sent, a record is stored in the
chatter.

### Close Payroll

If there are no errors, payroll is completed for the pay period.

## Run Christmas bonus payroll

To run the annual Christmas bonus, follow the same workflow for
`regular Mexico payroll
<payroll/run_mexico>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, using the
`Mexico: Christmas Bonus`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} salary
structure.

  not, select `SAR`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
  drop-down menu.
- `Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the company phone
  number.
- `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the email used for
  general contact information.

## Employees

Every employee being paid must have their employee profiles configured
for the Saudi Arabia payroll localization. Additional fields are present
after configuring the database for Saudi Arabia.

To update an employee form, open the `Employees`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} app and click on the desired employee record. On
the employee form, configure the required fields in the related tabs.

### Work tab

Enter the `Work Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
employee in the `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of
the `Work`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

### Personal tab

Select the correct `Nationality (Country)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for the employee, using the drop-down menu. The
selected nationality determines the GOSI rate.

Ensure the employee has a minimum of one
`trusted bank account <employees/private-contact>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} listed in the `Bank Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field in the `Private Contact`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section.

The employee\'s *bank account* is their
`IBAN (International Bank Account Number)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, which is how employees receive their salary according to
`WPS (Wages Protection System)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
regulations.

Payroll **cannot** be processed for employees without a *trusted*
`bank account
<employees/private-contact>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. If no
trusted bank account is set, a warning appears on the **Payroll**
dashboard and an error occurs when attempting to run payroll.

    employees paid based on hours worked.

  :::: tip
  ::: title
  Tip
  :::

  Set a default `Wage Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
  salary `Structure Type
  <payroll/structure-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to configure
  employees in bulk. If needed, the default can be overridden on
  individual employee records if exceptions are needed.
  ::::

- `Contract Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Determines how the
  employee is paid and classified, such as `Permanent`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Temporary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Seasonal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Pay Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
  `KSA (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for this field. This
  defines when the employee is paid, their default working schedule, and
  the work entry type it applies to.

![The contract overview section of the employee form of the payroll tab.](saudi_arabia/payroll-overview-sa.png)

#### Schedule section

- `Work Entry Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Defines how
  `work entries <../work_entries>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} are
  generated for payroll during the specified pay period. The options
  are:
  - `Working Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Based on the
    employee\'s assigned `working schedule
    <employees/schedule>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} (e.g., 40 hours
    per week).
  - `Attendances`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Based on
    `approved checked-in hours
    <../../attendances/management>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} in the
    **Attendances** app.
  - `Planning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Based on
    `scheduled shifts <planning/shifts>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    in the **Planning** app.
- `Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick the checkbox to
  allow the **Attendances** app to add any extra work entries logged by
  the employee.
- `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  drop-down menu, select the default work schedule. This is particularly
  important for employees available to receive overtime pay (typically
  hourly employees, not salaried).

#### Saudi payroll information section {#payroll/saudi_payroll_info}

Enter the employee\'s unique 10-digit
`Saudi National / IQAMA ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} number in
this field. This number is issued to Saudi citizens by the
`Ministerial Agency of Civil Affairs`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and is used for exporting WPS reports.

The `Annual Leave Balance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
not editable, and displays the employee\'s available annual vacation
days.

#### Allowances section

This section determines the various benefits the employee receives.
Enter the monthly Saudi riyal amount the employee receives from the
company for `Housing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Transportation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Other`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} costs.

Enter the annual amount paid by the company for a Saudi
`Iqama`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} ([iqama]{.title-ref} is the
Arabic word for [residence permit]{.title-ref}). An
`Iqama`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is an official residency and
identification card, similar to a visa, and it is . It is required for
**all** foreign nationals to have a valid `Iqama`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to work, live, and access various services in Saudi
Arabia.

Enter the annual amount the employer pays for the employee\'s
`Medical Insurance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
corresponding field.

If the employee needs a `Work Permit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, enter the annual fees the company pays.

#### End of service provision section

In Saudi Arabia, each employee earns a percentage of their annual salary
for each year they have worked with a company. This amount is computed
based on their salary. When they leave the company, they receive this
compensation in one lump sum.

Enter the `Number of Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the
employee earns in annual compensation, in the corresponding field. The
company sets this amount aside every year, so it is available when the
employee leaves.

## Payroll configuration

Several sections within the **Payroll** app installs a Salary Structure,
Structure Type, Rules, and Parameters specific to Saudi Arabia.
Additionally, some other configurations are required to run Saudi Arabia
payroll.

### Payroll settings {#payroll/saudi_payroll_settings}

Navigate to `Payroll --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to access the **Payroll** app settings required
for Saudi Arabia.

First, the company bank account must be configured to pay employees, per
WPS regulations. Click into the drop-down space beneath the
`Establishment Bank Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
and click `Create...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This opens a
`Create Establishment's Bank Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window.
`Configure the company's bank account  <employees/private-contact>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and ensure it is marked as *trusted*. Click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the information and
close the window.

Next, enter the company\'s `MoL Establishment ID`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. This ID number is provided by Saudi Arabia\'s Ministry
of Labor.

Finally, select the
`time off type <time_off/time-off-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
that is used to calculate the `Annual Leave Balance`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} set in the
`employee's profile <payroll/saudi_payroll_info>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### Salary structures & structure types

When the **l10n_sa_hr_payroll** module is
`installed <payroll/saudi_apps>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, a new
`Salary Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} gets installed,
`KSA Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This structure
includes two `Structure Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Saudi Arabia: Monthly Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`SA Salary Advance
And Loan Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The `Salary Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} contains all
the individual `salary rules <payroll/usa_apps>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} that informs the **Payroll** app how to calculate employee
payslips.

![The Saudi Arabia salary structure in the salary structures list.](saudi_arabia/structure-types-sa.png)

### Salary rules {#payroll/saudi_rules}

To view the salary rules that inform the salary structure what to do,
navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Structures`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and expand the `KSA
Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} group to reveal the two
available structure types. Click `Saudi Arabia: Monthly
Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to view the detailed salary
rules for that structure type.

![The top portion of the US salary rules.](saudi_arabia/sa-rules-top-half.png)

Each rule defines how pay is calculated, taking into account factors
such as allowances, deductions, and company contributions.

### Rule parameters

Some calculations require specific rates associated with them, or wage
caps. *Rules Parameters* are capable of listing a value, either a
percentage or a fixed amount, to reference in the salary rules.

Most rules pull information stored in the parameters module to get the
rate of the rule (a percentage) and the cap (a dollar amount).

To view rule parameters, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Rule
Parameters`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Here, all rule
parameters are displayed with their linked
`Salary Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which can be
accessed. Review the parameters associated with a rule by looking for
the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the rule, and make any
edits as needed.

The Saudi Arabia payroll localization comes with four rule parameters:

- `Saudi GOSI Company Contribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  This rule parameter determines the calculation of the GOSI
  contributions the employer must make for Saudi Arabia employees.
- `Non-Saudi GOSI Company Contribution`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: This rule parameter determines the calculation of
  the GOSI contributions the employer must make for each non-Saudi
  Arabian employee.
- `Saudi GOSI Employee Contribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  This rule parameter determines the calculation of the GOSI
  contributions the employee must make, and is deducted from their pay.
- `Saudi Arabia Overtime Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This
  rule parameter determines the overtime rate for employees.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo adds updated rule parameters for the current calendar year. It is
**not** recommended to edit rule parameters **unless a national or
provincial parameter has changed**, and is different from the rule
parameters created by Odoo. Check with all local and national
regulations *before* making any changes to rule parameters.
::::

## Run Saudi Arabia payroll {#payroll/saudi_run_payroll}

Before running payroll, the payroll officer must validate employee
`work entries
<../work_entries>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to confirm pay accuracy
and catch errors. This includes checking that all time off is approved
and any overtime is appropriate.

Work entries sync based on the employee\'s
`contract <../contracts>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} configuration.
Odoo pulls from the assigned working schedule, attendance records,
planning schedule, and approved time off.

Any `discrepancies or conflicts <payroll/conflicts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} must be resolved, then the work entries can be
`regenerated <payroll/regenerate-work-entries>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Once everything is correct, draft payslips can be
`created individually <payroll/process>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
or in `groups <../pay_runs>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, referred to
in the **Payroll** app as *Pay Runs*.

![The work entries for a pay run, with some time off entered in the work entries.](saudi_arabia/work-entries-sa.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To cut down on the payroll officer\'s time, it is typical to process
payslips in batches, either by wage type (fixed salary vs hourly), pay
schedule (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.), department (direct cost vs.
administration), or any other grouping that best suits the company.
::::

The process of running payroll includes different actions that need to
be executed to ensure that the amount that the employee receives as
their net salary is correct, any deductions or allocations are correct,
and the computation of hours worked reflects the employee\'s actual
hours worked, among others.

When running a payroll batch, check that the period, company, and
employees included are correct *before* starting to analyze or validate
the data.

Once the payslips are drafted, review them for accuracy. Check the
`Worked Days & Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and
ensure the listed worked time is correct, as well as any other inputs.
Add any missing inputs, such as commissions, tips, reimbursements, that
are missing.

Next, check the various totals (gross pay, allowances, contributions,
etc.), then click `Compute Sheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
update the salary calculations, if there were edits. If everything is
correct, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The worked days tab of a payslip.](saudi_arabia/check-payslips-sa.png)

### Accounting check

The accounting process when running payroll has two components:
`creating journal entries
<payroll/journal_saudi>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
`registering payments <payroll/register_saudi>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

#### Journal entry creation {#payroll/journal_saudi}

After payslips are confirmed and validated, journal entries are posted
either individually, or in a batch. The journal entry is created first
as a draft.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

It must be decided if journal entries are done individually or in
batches *before* running payroll.
::::

![All payslips in a draft state.](saudi_arabia/draft.png)

Fifteen accounts from the Saudi Arabia
`CoA (Chart of Accounts)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are included
with the payroll localization:

- \`400003 Basic Salary\`: Tracks the basic wages paid to employees.
- \`400004 Housing Allowance\`: Captures housing allowance payments
  provided to employees.
- \`400005 Transportation Allowance\`: Captures transportation allowance
  payments to employees.
- \`400012 Staff Other Allowances\`: Covers employee allowances that do
  not fit standard categories.
- \`106012 Prepaid Employee Expenses\`: Logged as prepaid assets for
  employer-paid items that are *not* wages (for example,
  [Iqama]{.title-ref} fees and medical insurance) and expensed as
  consumed.
- \`201006 Leave Days Provision\`: Accrues the cost of paid leave; the
  balance is reduced when leave is taken, and any leave not taken may be
  paid out at end of service.
- \`201022 GOSI Employee Payable\`: Holds amounts payable for social
  insurance contributions to the GOSI, including both employee and
  employer portions.
- \`202001 End of Service Provision\`: Accumulates the end-of-service
  benefit monthly so the amount can be paid (partially or fully) when
  the employee leaves, per service length and reason.
- \`400007 Leave Salary\`: Records salaries actually paid to employees
  while on paid leave.
- \`400008 End of Service Indemnity\`: Captures company expenses set
  aside to fund end-of-service benefits (expense-side counterpart to the
  provision).
- \`400009 Medical Insurance\`: Accounts for employer expenses related
  to employee medical insurance premiums.
- \`400010 Life Insurance\`: Tracks employer expenses for
  life/occupational insurance or the employer\'s portion of social
  insurance.
- \`400014 Visa Expenses\`: Used to track employer costs for non-Saudi
  Arabian employees\' visas and related processing/renewal fees.
- \`400074 Salary Deductions\`: Reflects deductions applied to employee
  salaries (e.g., advances, fines, statutory deductions).
- \`201002 Payables\`: Shows amounts payable to employees as salaries
  (unpaid salary liability at period end).

If everything seems correct on the journal entry draft, post the journal
entries.

![Journal entries posted.](saudi_arabia/validated.png)

### Register Payments {#payroll/register_saudi}

After the `journal entries <payroll/journal_saudi>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are validated, Odoo can generate payments.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To generate payments from payslips,employees **must** have a *trusted*
bank account. If the employee\'s bank account is *not* marked as
[trusted]{.title-ref}, WPS files **cannot** be generated through Odoo.
::::

Payments can be `Grouped by Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
if there is a partner associated with a salary rule.

![Payslips with a status of paid.](saudi_arabia/paid.png)

### Close Payroll

If there are no errors, payroll is completed for the pay period.

## Employee loans and advances

Employees are able to request `loans <payroll/loans>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or `advances <payroll/advances>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} against their salaries. *Loans* are handled by creating
salary adjustments, whereas *advances* are created and managed manually.

### Employee loans {#payroll/loans}

Employees can take out *loans* against their salary and repay the loan
with automatic deductions from future paychecks. These loans are handled
by `creating a salary adjustment
<payroll/salary_adjust_saudi>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to log the
total loan amount and set up a repayment plan, and
`creating a payslip for the total loan amount <payroll/loan_payslip_saudi>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. The employee then
`repays the loan <payroll/repay_saudi>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} in
the increments configured in the salary adjustment.

#### Create a salary adjustment {#payroll/salary_adjust_saudi}

When an employee requests a loan, first a *salary adjustment* is made,
where the total loan amount and repayment plan is configured.

To create the loan and repayment schedule, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Employees -->
Salary Adjustments`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a blank
`Salary Adjustment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form loads.

Configure the following fields on the form:

- `Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the employee taking out the loan.
- `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down menu,
  select `Loan Deduction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Payslip Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  `SAR (Saudi riyal)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} amount to be repaid
  each payslip.
- `Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick the
  `Limited`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, which reveals a
  `until`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (amount)
  `paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. First, using the
  calendar selector, enter the date the repayment begins. Next, enter
  the total loan amount in the field after `until`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. Once both fields are configured, Odoo calculates
  when the loan is fully repaid, and displays the date as follows: [end
  in \# years: (date)]{.title-ref}.
- `Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter any details about the
  loan in this field.

![A salary adjustment form filled out for an employee loan.](saudi_arabia/loan.png)

#### Generate a loan payslip {#payroll/loan_payslip_saudi}

After creating the salary adjustment, a button labeled
`Create Loan Payslip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears above
the form. Click `Create Loan Payslip`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and Odoo automatically generates a payslip configured
for the employee loan, in the amount set up in the `salary adjustment
<payroll/salary_adjust_saudi>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Review the payslip to ensure all the fields and tabs are correct. The
`Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should be
`SA Salary Advance And Loan Structure`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The `Salary Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab should list a `Loan Deduction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and the `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should be the full
amount of the loan.

Click into the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and
enter the date the employee receives the payment in the
`Payment Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Once the payslip form is correct, click
`Compute Sheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then click `Create
Draft Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`OK`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the confirmation pop-up
window. Next, click `Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to mark the
payment as paid, then click `Create Payment Report`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to
`generate the WPS report <payroll/reports_saudi>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

![A configured loan payslip.](saudi_arabia/loan-payslip.png)

#### Loan repayment to employer {#payroll/repay_saudi}

From the date set on the
`salary attachment <payroll/salary_adjust_saudi>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, all future paychecks have the configured repayment amount
taken out, to go towards the loan. Once the loan is fully paid, the
deductions end.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The deductions should end after the total is repaid, according to the
salary adjustment. To ensure payments *stop* being taken out of the
employee\'s paychecks after the loan has been repaid, open the salary
adjustment record. If the salary adjustment still has a status of
`Running`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click the
`Mark as Completed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and the
status changes to `Closed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
payments stop.
::::

### Salary advances {#payroll/advances}

Employees can request an advance of their salary, outside of the regular
pay cycle. This process is done by paying the employee with a
`manually created payslip <payroll/advance_slip>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, then the employee repays the advance either
`in full <payroll/repay_full>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} in the next
payslip, or in
`multiple payments <payroll/repay_partial>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} in subsequent paychecks until the total is repaid.

#### Create advance payslip {#payroll/advance_slip}

To issue an advanced payment, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Payslips --> Payslips`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click the `New Off-Cycle`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button and a blank
`Employee Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form loads.

Configure the following fields on the payslip:

- `Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the employee taking out the advance.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  Once the `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected,
  the `Employee Record`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
  populates with the most recent employee version (contract).
  ::::

- `Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select `SA Salary Advance And Loan
  Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Next, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Salary Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Select `Salary
Advance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
`Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Next, enter any relevant
description in the `Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
such as [Advance for auto repair]{.title-ref}. Last, enter the amount
being advanced in the `Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Once these fields have been configured, click
`Compute Sheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then click
`Create Draft Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`OK`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the confirmation pop-up
window. Click `Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to mark the
payment as paid, then click `Create Payment Report`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to
`generate the WPS report <payroll/reports_saudi>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

![A configured loan payslip.](saudi_arabia/advance.png)

#### Automatic repayment in full {#payroll/repay_full}

When the employee\'s next payslip is generated (using the [Saudi Arabia:
Monthly Pay]{.title-ref} structure), a line is added under the [Other
Inputs]{.title-ref} tab, titled [Advanced Recovery]{.title-ref}.

The amount is based on the advance previously taken by the employee. If
the employee cannot repay the full amount in the paycheck, the repayment
can be broken up into `multiple payments
<payroll/repay_partial>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

#### Multiple payments {#payroll/repay_partial}

When an employee cannot repay an advance in full in a future payslip,
the employee can make partial payments until the advance is repaid. To
do this, the amount being deducted from the employee\'s paycheck must be
manually modified.

Open the employee\'s payslip, and under the
`Salary Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, modify the
amount specified on the `Advanced Recovery`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} line.

Odoo automatically calculates the remainder of the advance, and adds an
`Advanced
Recovery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line for the balance in the
subsequent payslip. If the employee cannot pay the second payment in
full, the `Advanced Recovery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line
can be edited in the following payslip.

## WPS reports {#payroll/reports_saudi}

The WPS report is a mandatory report all Saudi Arabian companies are
required to provide the government. The report confirms employee wages,
including when and how much they were paid. The WPS report can be
generated either per payslip or per pay run.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This report is structured in accordance with the technical guidelines
issued by the MHRSD.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To run the WPS report, the
`Establishment Bank Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Ministry of
Labor Establishment ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields
**must** be
`configured <payroll/saudi_payroll_settings>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for the company.

Ensure the `Establishment Bank Account`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} has the `Bank Establishment ID`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `Bank SARIE Code`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} fields configured, and the bank is marked as
`Trusted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Ensure all employees included in the report have a
`Saudi National / IQAMA ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set on
their employee profile.
::::

First,
`payslips or pay runs are generated <payroll/saudi_run_payroll>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, then the `journal
entries are posted <payroll/journal_saudi>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Click the `Payment Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on
the `Pay Runs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, the
individual pay run, or an individual payslip, and a payment report
pop-up window loads.

`Saudi WPS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected in the
`Export Format`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, by default,
and the `Payment Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`WPS Value Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields are both
populated according to the selected payslips or pay runs.

The `WPS Debit Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is an optional
field, and specifies the date the company physically pays the employees
(transfers funds from the company account to employee accounts).

Once all fields are configured, click `Generate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and the WPS report is created.

## General configurations

First, the company must be configured. Navigate to
`Settings app --> Users &
Companies --> Companies`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. From
the list, select the desired company, and configure the following
fields:

- `Company Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the business
  name in this field.
- `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Complete the full
  address, including the `City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `ZIP`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, and `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the company\'s tax
  ID.
- `Company ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} : Enter the
  business\'s ID number.
- `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: By default,
  `TRY (Turkish lira)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is selected. If
  not, select `TRY`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
  drop-down menu.
- `Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the company phone
  number.
- `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the email used for
  general contact information.

## Employees

Every employee being paid must have their employee profiles configured
for the Türkiye payroll localization. Additional fields are present
after configuring the database for Türkiye.

To update an employee form, open the `Employees`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} app and click on the desired employee record. On
the employee form, configure the required fields in the related tabs.

### Work tab

Enter the `Work Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
employee in the `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of
the `Work`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

### Personal tab

Ensure the employee has a minimum of one
`trusted bank account <employees/private-contact>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} listed in the `Bank Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field in the `Private Contact`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section.

These accounts are used to pay the employee. Payroll **cannot** be
processed for employees without a *trusted*
`bank account <employees/private-contact>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. If no trusted bank account is set, a warning appears on the
**Payroll** dashboard and an error occurs when attempting to run
payroll.

### Payroll tab

#### Contract overview section {#payroll/turkey_contract}

This section holds information that drives salary calculations. Ensure
the following fields are configured:

- `Contract`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Ensure a contract start
  date is entered in the first field.

- `Wage Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select how the
  employee is paid.

  - Select `Fixed Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for salaried
    employees who receive the same amount each pay period.
  - Select `Hourly Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
    employees paid based on hours worked.

  :::: tip
  ::: title
  Tip
  :::

  Set a default `Wage Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
  salary `Structure Type
  <payroll/structure-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to configure
  employees in bulk. If needed, the default can be overridden on
  individual employee records if exceptions are needed.
  ::::

- `Net to Gross`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Leave this box
  unchecked if the gross salary is based on a fixed gross and a
  dynamically computed net (Gross to Net). Activate this option if the
  gross salary is based on a fixed net and a dynamically computed gross
  (Net to Gross).

- `Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If
  `Net to Gross`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is unchecked, this
  field displays `Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If it is
  checked, this field displays `Net Wage`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. Enter the monthly amount earned by the employee.

- `Employee Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: May affect the
  working hours for the employee.

- `Contract Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Determines how the
  employee is paid and classified, such as `Permanent`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Temporary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Student`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Pay Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
  `Türkiye: Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for this field.
  This defines when the employee is paid, their default working
  schedule, and the work entry type it applies to.

![The contract overview section of the employee form of the payroll tab.](turkey/contract-tr.png)

#### Schedule section

- `Work Entry Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Defines how
  `work entries <../work_entries>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} are
  generated for payroll during the specified pay period. The options
  are:
  - `Working Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Based on the
    employee\'s assigned `working schedule
    <employees/schedule>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} (e.g., 40 hours
    per week).
  - `Attendances`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Based on
    `approved checked-in hours
    <../../attendances/management>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} in the
    **Attendances** app.
  - `Planning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Based on
    `scheduled shifts <planning/shifts>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    in the **Planning** app.
- `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  drop-down menu, select the default work schedule. This is particularly
  important for employees available to receive overtime pay (typically
  hourly employees, not salaried).

## Payroll configuration

Several sections within the **Payroll** app install a Salary Structure,
Structure Type, Rules, and Parameters specific to Türkiye.

### Salary structures & structure types

When the **l10n_tr_payroll** module is
`installed <payroll/turkey_apps>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, a new
`Salary Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} gets installed,
`Türkiye: Regular Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This
structure includes one `Structure Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Türkiye: Employee`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

The `Salary Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} contains all
the individual `salary rules
<payroll/turkey_rules>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} that informs the
**Payroll** app how to calculate employee payslips.

![The Türkiye salary structure in the salary structures list.](turkey/structure-types-tr.png)

### Salary rules {#payroll/turkey_rules}

To view the salary rules that inform the salary structure what to do,
navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Structures`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and expand the `Türkiye:
Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} group to reveal the
`Türkiye: Monthly Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} structure
type. Click `Türkiye: Monthly Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
view the detailed salary rules.

![The top portion of the Türkiye salary rules.](turkey/tr-rules-top-half.png)

Each rule defines how pay is calculated, taking into account factors
such as commissions, bonuses, taxes, and insurance.

### Rule parameters {#payroll/turkey_rule-parameters}

Some calculations require specific rates associated with them, or wage
caps. *Rules Parameters* are capable of listing a value, either a
percentage or a fixed amount, to reference in the salary rules.

Most rules pull information stored in the parameters module to get the
rate of the rule (a percentage) and the cap (a monetary amount).

To view rule parameters, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Rule
Parameters`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Here, all rule
parameters are displayed with their linked
`Salary Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which can be
accessed. Review the parameters associated with a rule by looking for
the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the rule, and make any
edits as needed.

Ensure the following rules parameters are up to date with current rules
and regulations:

- `Türkiye Minimum Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Türkiye SSI Base Amount Ceiling`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Türkiye Tax Exemption Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Türkiye Stamp Tax Percentage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Türkiye Tax Bracket Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Türkiye SSI Company Contribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

::: example
The minimum wage is updated, and is different from the one added by
default in Odoo. To update this, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Rule Parameters`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then click the rule parameter
`Türkiye Minimum Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and add the new
`Parameter Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (minimum wage), and
reference the date the change goes into effect.
:::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo adds updated rule parameters for the current calendar year. It is
**not** recommended to edit rule parameters **unless a parameter has
changed**, and is different from the rule parameters created by Odoo.
Check with all local and national regulations *before* making any
changes to rule parameters.
::::

## Türkiye taxes

The following sections explain in detail the various employer and
employee taxes specific to Türkiye.

### Social insurance

Social insurance rules calculate the contribution amounts that are to be
paid by the employer and employee to the
`SSI (Social Security Institution)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. This
is **only** available for Türkiye employees.

Social insurance consists of two main categories:

- **Social Insurance**: Employers contribute 15% of their employee\'s
  salaries to the `SSI
  (Social Security Institution)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, while
  employees contribute 14% of their salaries, which is deducted from
  their payslips.
- **Unemployment Insurance**: Employers contribute 2% of their
  employee\'s salaries to the
  `SSI (Social Security Institution)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
  while employees contribute 1% of their salary, which is deducted from
  their payslips.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Employer and employee contributions for both categories are calculated
according to a salary maximum that is revised each year. Therefore, it
is necessary to check the corresponding
`rule parameters <payroll/turkey_rule-parameters>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to ensure all taxes are current.
::::

### Income tax

Employees in Türkiye are subject to a progressive income tax system,
where tax rates increase with higher annual income levels.

To calculate the deductible tax amount for the current month, the
following is done:

1.  **Compute year-to-date gross amount**: This serves as the base
    amount for calculating the employee\'s taxable salary.
2.  **Determine year-to-date taxable amount**: The taxable amount is
    compared to progressive tax brackets to compute the year-to-date tax
    amount due.
3.  **Subtract prior month\'s tax**: The amount taxed in previous months
    is subtracted from the year-to-date tax to obtain the pre-exemption
    tax amount due for the current month.
4.  **Deduct exemption amount**: The exemption amount is deducted from
    the pre-exemption tax to determine the final tax due amount
    post-exemptions.

#### Tax brackets

As of 2025, and depending on the annual income of the employee, the
following rates apply:

  Taxable Bracket   Range
  ----------------- ---------------------------
  15%               0.00 - 158,000.00
  20%               158,000.00 - 330,000.00
  27%               330,000.00 - 800,000.00
  35%               800,000.00 - 4,300,000.00
  40%               above 4,300,000.00

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Tax brackets are applied progressively. This means each portion of an
employee\'s income is taxed at its respective rate within each bracket,
rather than their entire income being taxed at the highest rate they
fall into.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Turkish employees benefit from a monthly personal income tax
**exemption**, which is adjusted each year. For 2025, the exemption
amount is TRY 3,315.70 per month, from January through July.
::::

#### Stamp Tax

Stamp tax is applied to gross salary payments in Türkiye. The standard
rate is 0.759% (i.e. 7.59 per thousand), which is withheld from the
employee\'s gross wage and remitted to the tax authority
`GIB (Gelir İdaresi Başkanliği,)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by the
employer.

The base amount for the stamp tax is the total gross salary amount
(including bonuses or extras).

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Turkish employees receive a personal stamp tax **exemption**, the value
of which is updated annually. As of 2025, the exemption amount is TRY
197.38 per month, from January through July. This applies to gross
earnings up to the legal minimum wage level before calculating stamp
tax.
::::

### Net to gross

On an employee record, if the option `Net to Gross`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is enabled in the `contract
section <payroll/turkey_contract>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} of the
payroll tab, the net salary is fixed, and specified in the
`Net Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, while the gross
wage is recalculated each month, and increases throughout the year.

The gross wage is what tax calculations are based on, so for these
employees, the monthly *net* wage does **not** change, but the monthly
*gross* amount is recalculated each month, changing the taxes with it.

In this scenario, the least amount of taxes are paid in the beginning of
the year, and taxes increase as the year progresses.

::: example
On January 31st, an employee\'s year-to-date total income is ₺10,000.
The income tax is calculated based on the ₺10,000, which in this example
is ₺800. In February, the employee\'s year-to-date gross is ₺20,000, and
the taxes are calculated based on that figure, for a total of ₺2,000.

Since the employee already paid ₺800 in January, the taxes due for
February are ₺1,200 because the employee already paid ₺800 toward that
total (₺2,000 - ₺800 = ₺1,200).
:::

### Gross to net

On an employee record, if the option `Net to Gross`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is **not** enabled in the
`contract section <payroll/turkey_contract>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} of the payroll tab, the gross salary is calculated based on
the `Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

The gross wage then has all the salary rules computed, to determine the
*net* wage. The taxes are then computed based on the gross wage. In this
scenario, unlike with net to gross, taxes are more consistent and do not
change that much, from month to month.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The gross from net calculation depends on the salary rules defined in
the `Türkiye:
Monthly Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} salary structure.
Changes made to those rules affect the computed amount.
::::

## Run Türkiye payroll

Before running payroll, the payroll officer must validate employee
`work entries
<../work_entries>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to confirm pay accuracy
and catch errors. This includes checking that all time off is approved
and any overtime is appropriate.

Work entries sync based on the employee\'s
`contract <../contracts>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} configuration.
Odoo pulls from the assigned working schedule, attendance records,
planning schedule, and approved time off.

Any `discrepancies or conflicts <payroll/conflicts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} must be resolved, then the work entries can be
`regenerated <payroll/regenerate-work-entries>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Once everything is correct, draft payslips can be
`created individually <payroll/process>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
or in `groups <../pay_runs>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, referred to
in the **Payroll** app as *Pay Runs*.

![The work entries for a pay run, with some time off entered in the work entries.](turkey/work-entries-tr.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To cut down on the payroll officer\'s time, it is typical to process
payslips in batches, either by wage type (fixed salary vs hourly), pay
schedule (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.), department (direct cost vs.
administration), or any other grouping that best suits the company.
::::

The process of running payroll includes different actions that need to
be executed to ensure that the amount withheld from payroll taxes is
correct, the amount that the employee receives as their net salary is
correct, and the computation of hours worked reflects the employee\'s
actual hours worked, among others.

When running a payroll batch, check that the period, company, and
employees included are correct *before* starting to analyze or validate
the data.

Once the payslips are drafted, review them for accuracy. Check the
`Worked Days & Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and
ensure the listed worked time is correct, as well as any other inputs.
Add any missing inputs, such as commissions, tips, reimbursements, that
are missing.

Next, check the various totals (gross pay, employee taxes, benefits,
employer taxes, net salaries), then click
`Compute Sheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to update the salary
calculations, if there were edits. If everything is correct, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The worked days tab of a payslip.](turkey/check-payslip-tr.png)

### Accounting check

The accounting process when running payroll has two components:
`creating journal entries
<payroll/journal-tr>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`registering payments <payroll/register-tr>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

#### Journal entry creation {#payroll/journal-tr}

After payslips are confirmed and validated, journal entries are posted
either individually, or in a batch. The journal entry is created first
as a draft.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

It must be decided if journal entries are done individually or in
batches *before* running payroll.
::::

![All payslips in a draft state.](turkey/create-draft-entry-tr.png)

### Register Payments {#payroll/register-tr}

After the `journal entries <payroll/journal-tr>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are validated, Odoo can generate payments.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To generate payments from payslips, employees **must** have a *trusted*
bank account. If the employee\'s bank account is *not* marked as
[trusted]{.title-ref}, payments **cannot** be generated through Odoo.
::::

Payments can be `Grouped by Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
if there is a partner associated with a salary rule.

![Payslips with a status of paid.](turkey/paid-tr.png)

### Close Payroll

If there are no errors, payroll is completed for the pay period.

## Employees

First, configure the
`employee general information <../../employees/new_employee>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and then configure the following fields under the
`Private Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:

- `Nationality (Country)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The
  nationality affects an employee\'s payslips, whether they are
  nationals or expats.
- `Identification Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Used to
  extract the `WPS report
  <payroll/l10n_ae/wps-reports>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
- `Bank Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Used to extract the
  `WPS report <payroll/l10n_ae/wps-reports>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} and generate payments for those employees.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Nationality (Country)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
needs to be set even if the employee is a
`UAE (United Arab Emirates)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} national
since there is a different type of handling if they are citizens of a
`GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} country.
::::

## Contracts

Once the employee form has been created, ensure the
`contract <../contracts>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} is enabled by
clicking on the `fa-book`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Contracts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button, or going to
`Employees --> Contracts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

The following contractual information related to employees working in
the United Arab Emirates are found under the
`Salary Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:

- `Wage Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Fixed Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for Full-time or
  Part-time employees, or `Hourly Wage`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} for employees who are paid hourly.
- `Scheduled Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the frequency of
  payslip issuance.
- `Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: `Monthly`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} or `Hourly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  depending on the `Wage
  Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Housing Allowance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Transportation Allowance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Other Allowance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The allowance values set on the contract are used on the payslip lines
as allowances.
::::

- `Number of Leave Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Used to
  specify the number of annual leave days that an employee deserves in a
  particular year. Regardless of the actual number of leaves that the
  employee gets (extra leave days for some internal company reasons),
  the final calculation of the end of service and unpaid leaves is
  dependent on the number set on this field.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  The `Number of Leave Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} affects
  the calculation for unpaid leave provisions.
  ::::

- `Is DEWS Applied`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: DIFC Employee
  Workplace Savings (DEWS), if the employee is a
  `UAE (United Arab Emirates)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} national
  and has
  `DEWS (Daman Investments End of Service Programme)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} applied, tick this checkbox.

- `Computed Based On Daily Salary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  Defines the way that the end of service is calculated:

  - Do not tick this checkbox if the standard calculation is to be used.
    This computes the compensation amount by dividing the monthly salary
    by **30** and then multiplying it by **21**.
  - Tick this checkbox and directly set the actual
    `Daily Salary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} so that it is used
    in the end of service calculation.
  - Tick this checkbox and directly set the actual
    `Daily Salary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} so that it is used
    in the end of service calculation.

## Salary structures and salary rules

### Other input rules

The following are the different allowances that can be defined directly
on the `payslip form
<../payslips>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to allow for the values
that are set against these inputs to affect the
`WPS (Wages Protection System)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
calculations as monthly variable salaries for the specific employee that
they are linked to.

Rules that are related to the
`WPS (Wages Protection System)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} setup,
are linked to other input types, and whenever they are used, their
values are reflected on the
`WPS (Wages Protection System)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} as
monthly variable salary for that specific employee.

### End of service (EOS)

End of service (EOS) provides the calculation for the allowance that the
employee gets at the end of their service. It is triggered when the
employee\'s departure reason is set by archiving the employee\'s record.

There are several different calculations depending on the scenario:

1.  *The Employee spent less than a year in the company*: The employee
    does not get any `EOS (End Of Service)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} allowance since they are not eligible for it (they are
    eligible once they complete their first year in the company).

2.  *The Employee spent more than a year and less than 5 years in the
    company*: The employee is eligible for an equivalent of **21** days
    of salary for each year they spent on the company.

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    There are two ways for calculating the daily wage that gets paid for
    the employee against the 21 days of the
    `EOS (End Of Service)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}: Either by the
    default way of dividing the monthly basic wage by 30. Or, it can be
    manually input on the contract of the employee under the *Daily
    Salary* field.
    ::::

3.  *The Employee spent more than 5 years in the company*: The employee
    is eligible for an equivalent of **30** days of salary for each year
    they spent on the company. In this case, if the default method is
    used, then the employee gets paid an equivalent of 1 month of
    salary, and the set *Daily Salary* field, they will get the amount
    for the day multiplied by 30.

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    There are two payslips printout formats, one for normal salaries and
    one for end of service payslips, it is based on the employee being
    archived and having a departure reason or not.
    ::::

### End of service provision (EOS Provision)

The `EOS (End Of Service)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} provision
provides the calculation for the end-of-service provision amount that
the company puts aside every month to count for the
`EOS (End Of Service)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that will be paid
to them as an `EOS (End Of Service)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
allowance.

Unlike the `EOS (End Of Service)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
provision is part of the employee\'s payslip from the start of their
contract.

Just like the `EOS (End Of Service)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, the
provision has two calculations depending on the period spent by the
employee in the company:

- Less than 5 years:
  $\frac{\text{Monthly Wage}}{30}\times{\frac{21}{12}}$

- More than 5 years:
  $\frac{\text{Monthly Wage}}{30}\times{\frac{30}{12}}$

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  This rule is not shown to the employee on the payslip printout and it
  does not affect their net payable, it is only for internal use by the
  company.
  ::::

### Annual leave provisions

Annual leave provisions are used for calculating the annual leave
provision accumulated each month, just like the
`EOS (End Of Service)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} provision, it does
not affect the total amount paid to the employee, it is for internal use
by the company.

It is calculated by dividing the employee\'s total salary (Total Salary
= Wage + Allowances) by **30** to get the daily salary. The daily salary
is then multiplied by the eligible leave days and divided by **12** to
determine the monthly provision amount.

[$$\text{Monthly Leave Provision} = \frac{\text{Total Salary} \times \text{Number of Leave Days}}{30}
\div 12$$]{.overflow-scroll}

### Social insurance contributions

Social insurance contributions calculate the *social insurance*, which
is only available to `UAE (United Arab Emirates)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} nationals.

The company contributes **15%** of the total monthly salary for the
employee if the company is in **Abu Dhabi** and **12.5%** if the company
is in **another Emirate**.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The total monthly salary for the employee = \[basic + all allowances set
on the contract\].
::::

On the other hand, the employee contributes **5%** of their total
monthly salary and that amount gets deducted from the payslip amount.

### Annual remaining leave balance rules

Annual remaining leave balance rules are used for calculating the amount
to be paid to or taken from the employee based on the number of leave
days deserved by the employee during the current year.

The annual leave
`time off type <time_off/time-off-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
is specified using the `Is
Annual Leave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

If enabled, the rule calculates the amount of leave days deserved by the
employee up to the current date and subtracts the number of annual leave
days taken, and if the result is positive, this means that the employee
should be compensated for remaining amount and if negative this means
that the employee is liable to the company for the difference.

### Sick leave rules

Sick leave rules provide the calculation for cases where the employee is
on sick leave and decides how the payslip should be affected.

There are **3 cases** for the employee to have:

1.  **Fully paid sick leave:** The employee can upload a sick leave
    certificate (SLI). Employees are eligible for **15 days** of this
    type of leave per calendar year.

    :::: tip
    ::: title
    Tip
    :::

    The SLI is not mandatory in Odoo but can be done from the setup of
    the `time off types
    <time_off/time-off-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
    ::::

2.  **50% paid sick leave:** Same as the fully paid one, but the
    employees are eligible for **30 days** from this leave type. These
    30 days are counted after the first **15** fully paid days.

3.  **0% paid sick leave:** Same as the fully paid one, but the
    employees are eligible for **45 days** from this leave type. These
    **45 days** are counted after the first **15/30** fully/half-paid
    days.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

As per the labor law of the United Arab Emirates, the 15, 30, 45 days
are not specified as working days or calendar days so this point will
rely on the company policy.
::::

The amount paid for the employee per sick leave day is counted as
follows:

[$$\frac{\text{Number of Leave Days} \times \text{Gross Per Month}}{30} \times \text{Percentage}$$]{.overflow-scroll}

Where the gross per month is the basic + all other allowances set on the
employee\'s contract.

### Daman investments end of service programme (DEWS)

`DEWS (Daman Investments End of Service Programme)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} allows for calculating the
`DEWS (Daman Investments End of Service Programme)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} amounts for the employees who are eligible for it and would
like to be registered on it under their current contract with the
company.

It is calculated based on the number of years that employees have spent
in the company:

- **Less than 5 years:** 5.83% is deducted from the employee\'s
  **BASIC** salary towards the DEWS.
- **More than 5 years:** 8.33% of The employee\'s **BASIC** is deducted
  from the total payable for that employee.

### Unpaid leaves

Unpaid leaves allows for calculating the amount to be deducted when an
employee takes an unpaid leave. It is calculated by the following
equation:

[$$\frac{\text{Total Number of Unpaid Leave Days} \times \text{Gross Per Month}}{30}$$]{.overflow-scroll}

Where the gross per month is the basic + all other allowances set on the
employee\'s contract.

### Out of contract days

The out of contract days rule provides a calculation for the days
before/after the contract period that overlaps with the contract of days
on the employee\'s payslips.

::: example
Payslips are generated for the period of 1st-30th of September but the
contract expires on the 21st, in this case, there are 7 days flagged as
out of contract.
:::

It is calculated by the following equation:

[$$\frac{\text{Total Number of Unpaid Leave Days} \times \text{Gross Per Month}}{\text{Number of Days in Current Month}}$$]{.overflow-scroll}

### Manual deductions

Manual deductions allows the user to add manual deductions to be applied
to employees per payslip.

The amount to be deducted and the description of the deduction is to be
set directly on the payslip manually as other inputs.

### Net salary

Net salary showcases the net amount that the employee will get based on
the payslip.

It is calculated by adding basic to all allowances and deducting all
deductions from it.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The approach taken for the rules above is to first get the full amounts
for all static amounts that are set on the contract and then deduct the
amounts that should be deducted such as unpaid leaves, sick leaves,
manual deductions, commission, etc.
::::

## Generating accounting entries from payslips

The accounts are linked to each payroll rule as a debit or credit so
that when a draft entry is generated from a payslip, the amounts are
reflected on the accounts accordingly.

The accounts need to be set in a way that would make the end-result
entry balanced, otherwise a warning is raised if it is not balanced and
it will not generate the entry.

After reviewing the payslips and making sure that all the amounts are
correct, generate a draft entry, either one entry for all employees or
an entry per employee depending on the setup done on the settings.

::: example
Debit and credit accounts set up for the basic and allowance rules.

![Accounting setup for the rules.](united_arab_emirates/accounting-setup-for-rules.png)
:::

## Pay employees

After a batch or a payslip\'s journal entry has been posted, the company
can proceed to pay their employees.

In the batch itself or on the payslip, by clicking on the pay button, a
payment is created and linked to the posted entry for the payslip. The
same can be done for batch payslips if one payment is done from a
single/multiple payment bank/cash journal.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Once the payslip is generated, the employee will be able to access the
slips from their portal users. They will automatically receive an email
mentioning that the payslips are now available to be viewed on their
portal view.
::::

## Payslip printouts

Two printout formats can be extracted from the payslip, it depends on
the type of the payslip either a *Monthly* payslip or an *End of
Service* Payslip. It is triggered if the employee for the payslip is
generated is archived during that month.

## Instant Pay structure

This structure is used when off-cycle payslips are required to make
payments to employees for special situations, such as one-time or
advance salaries. Examples of one-time payments include:

- Commissions
- Bonuses
- Allowances

## Salary Advances

Employees may request a portion of their salary before the end of the
pay cycle. In such cases, the payroll officer can issue a salary advance
using the following steps:

1.  Create an off-cycle payslip using the United Arab Emirates: Instant
    Pay structure.
2.  Add another input of type Salary Advance and specify the amount to
    be paid to the employee.
3.  Confirm the payslip and process the payment.

In the next cycle, when a payslip is generated for the employee using
the [United Arab Emirates: Regular Pay]{.title-ref} structure, another
input type, [Advance Recovery]{.title-ref} is automatically added for
the same amount that was previously paid.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If the employee and payroll officer agree to recover the advance over
two consecutive cycles, the payroll officer can adjust the Advance
Recovery amount on the first payslip. The remaining balance is
automatically added to the following cycle.
::::

## Wages protection system (WPS) reports {#payroll/l10n_ae/wps-reports}

The `WPS (Wages Protection System)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is a
report that needs to be submitted by the company to prove that they paid
their employees the right amounts on the right dates. It can either be
generated per payslip or batch.

The following steps need to be followed before generating the report:

1.  Go to `Payroll --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and under the `UAE
    Payroll WPS Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
    configure the following:

    - `Employer Unique ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Set a
      unique identifier for the company to be used in the
      `WPS (Wages Protection System)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
      report.

    - `Salaries Bank Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
      a bank account or start typing to `Create
      and edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} a new bank account.

      :::: important
      ::: title
      Important
      :::

      When setting the `Salaries Bank Account`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"} make sure to complete the following:

      - `Account Holder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: set as the
        company.
      - `Account Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: has to be a
        valid IBAN.
      - `Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: has to have the
        `UAE Routing Code Agent ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
        set.
      - `Send Money`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: should be
        enabled and set to `Trusted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
      ::::

2.  Set the unique identifier on all of the employees who are a part of
    the target of the batch/payslip.

    The `Identification No`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field can
    be found on the employee\'s page under the
    `Private Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

Once the initial setup is done, the
`WPS (Wages Protection System)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can be
generated either for one payslip or for a batch as follows:

1.  Generate the payslip one by one or as a batch.
2.  Post the draft entity related to the payslips.
3.  Create the payment report and set the
    `Export Format`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
    `UAE WPS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The report comes in a `.sif`{.interpreted-text role="file"} format as
per the governmental requirements, so either use software that can open
`.sif`{.interpreted-text role="file"} files or convert it to another
format (`.xslx`{.interpreted-text role="file"}) to be able to review it.
::::

The resulting file consists of the following:

1.  **Employee Detail Record** (**EDR**): includes details of the
    employees on the batch. There should be one
    `EDR (Employee Detail Record)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} record
    per employee.
2.  **Employee Variable Pay** (**EVP**): includes the details of the
    variable salary the employee got on that payslip. If the employee
    has any. The variable amounts are calculated from when other inputs
    are used that are linked to the salary rules
    (`Payroll --> Configuration
    --> Rules`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}).
3.  **Salary Control Record** (**SCR**): There should only be one
    `SCR (Salary Control Record)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} per
    `WPS (Wages Protection System)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} file
    as it indicates the employer details and the totals for the
    payslips.

## Employees

Every employee being paid must have their employee profiles configured
for the United States payroll localization. Additional fields are
present after configuring the database for the United States.

To update an employee form, open the `Employees`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} app and click on the desired employee record. On
the employee form, configure the required fields in the related tabs.

### Work tab

Enter the `Work Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
employee in the `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of
the `Work`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

:::: important
::: title

### Personal tab

Ensure the employee has a minimum of one
`trusted bank account <employees/private-contact>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} listed in the `Bank Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field in the `Private Contact`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section.

These accounts are used to pay the employee, via an automation through a
NACHA payment file. Payroll **cannot** be processed for employees
without a *trusted* `bank account
<employees/private-contact>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. If no
trusted bank account is set, a warning appears on the **Payroll**
dashboard and an error occurs when attempting to run payroll.

Ensure there is a valid `SSN No`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
entered in the `Citizenship`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section
. The last four digits of the
`SSN (Social Security Number)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} number
appears on the employee\'s payslips.

### Payroll tab

#### Contract overview section

This section holds information that drives salary calculations. Ensure
the following fields are configured:

- `Contract`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The Validity of the
  compensation conditions can be updated depending on the needs.

- `Wage Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select how the
  employee is paid.

  - Select `Fixed Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for salaried
    employees who receive the same amount each pay period.
  - Select `Hourly Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
    employees paid based on hours worked.

  :::: tip
  ::: title
  Tip
  :::

  Set a default `Wage Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
  salary `Structure Type
  <payroll/structure-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to configure
  employees in bulk. If needed, the default can be overridden on
  individual employee records if exceptions are needed.
  ::::

- `Contract Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Determines how the
  employee is paid and classified, such as
  `Salary-exempt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Salary-nonexempt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Hourly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  This field is visible on payslips. Some states require payslips to
  state if the employee is exempt or non-exempt from overtime. Ensure
  the selection follows the state laws.
  ::::

- `Pay Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
  `United States: Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for this
  field. This defines when the employee is paid, their default working
  schedule, and the work entry type it applies to.

![The contract overview section of the employee form of the payroll tab.](united_states/payroll-overview.png)

#### Schedule section

- `Work Entry Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Defines how
  `work entries <../work_entries>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} are
  generated for payroll during the specified pay period. The options
  are:
  - `Working Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Based on the
    employee\'s assigned `working schedule
    <employees/schedule>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} (e.g., 40 hours
    per week).
  - `Attendances`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Based on
    `approved checked-in hours
    <../../attendances/management>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} in the
    **Attendances** app.
  - `Planning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Based on
    `scheduled shifts <planning/shifts>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    in the **Planning** app.
- `Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick the checkbox to
  allow the **Attendances** app to add any extra work entries logged by
  the employee.
- `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  drop-down menu, select the default work schedule. This is particularly
  important for employees available to receive overtime pay (typically
  hourly employees, not salaried).

#### W-2 form section

A W-2 is an annual tax form that reports an employee\'s wages, taxes,
and benefits. Employees use it to file their tax returns. The options
below correspond to checkboxes in *box 13* of the W-2 form. Select any
that apply to the employee.

- `Statutory Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick this box
  if the employee is exempt from income tax, but subject to
  `FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} taxes.
- `Retirement Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick this box if
  the employee is an active contributor to an employer-sponsored
  retirement plan.
- `Third-Party Sick Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick this
  box if the employee is covered under a plan where sick pay benefits
  may be provided by a third party (e.g., an insurance company) during
  the year.

#### W-4 form section

A W-4 is an `IRS (Internal Revenue Services)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} form that determines an employee\'s federal tax
withholding, which the employer remits directly to the
`IRS (Internal Revenue Services)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Configure any relevant fields for the employee in this section.

#### State filing section

An employee\'s marital status impacts their payroll taxes. Configure the
following fields regarding their status and withholdings.

- `Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down menu,
  select the employee\'s *federal* filing status. The options are
  `Single`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Married/RDP filing jointly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Married/RDP
  filing separately`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Head of household`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Qualifying surviving spouse/RDP
  with child`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This typically comes
  from the employee\'s W-4 form.

- `Tax Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the employee\'s *state* filing status, if applicable.

  :::: tip

  As of 2025, these states do **not** collect state income tax: Alaska,
  Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas,
  Washington, and Wyoming. If a payroll localization exists for these
  states, there are **no** corresponding state options in the `Tax
  Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Leave it blank.
  ::::

- `Withholding Allowance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  total annual amount to be withheld from the employee\'s pay for the
  year, for state taxes. Only fill this out if the employee lives in a
  state with state income tax.

- `Extra Withholding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  total *extra* annual amount (not including the
  `Withholding Allowance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} amount) to
  be withheld from the employee\'s pay for the year, for state taxes, if
  the employee lives in a state with state income tax.

![The state filing section of the employee form, filled out.](united_states/state-filing.png)

#### Common benefits

The following sections of benefits are considered common ones offered by
US employers. This information needs to be populated with the
information selected by the employee.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The benefits listed in this section are considered the most commonly
offered by companies. If other employee benefits exist that require
regular paycheck deductions, they can be added as *inputs*.
::::

##### Pre-tax deductions

Pre-tax benefits lower the employee\'s gross wage, which decreases the
base amount for tax calculations. These are displayed at the beginning
of the payslip before the gross wage is stipulated.

###### Retirement plans section

This section is where the employee and employer 401(k) contributions are
configured. Fill out the following fields:

- `401(k)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the amount of money
  taken out of the employee\'s payslip each pay period. This can be
  entered either as a percentage (%) of the payslip amount, or a
  specific dollar amount per payslip (\$/slip).
- `Matching Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  matching amount the employer contributes to the employee\'s 401(k), as
  compared to the employee\'s contributions. This field can also be
  configured as either a percentage (%) of the employee\'s contribution,
  or a specific dollar amount (\$/slip).
- `Matching Yearly Cap`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If there is
  a limit to the employer\'s contribution, enter it as a percentage of
  the employee\'s annual salary.

::: example
A company allows employees to contribute to a 401(k) retirement plan,
and matches 50% of the employee\'s contributions, up to \$5,000 USD a
year. The employee earns \$50,000 USD a year, and contributes 20% of
their pay to their 401(k), which is \$10,000 USD.

To configure this, enter [20.00]{.title-ref} in the
`401(k)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, [50.00]{.title-ref}
in the `Matching Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and
[20.00]{.title-ref} in the `Matching Yearly Cap`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

![An employee\'s retirement configurations.](united_states/retirement.png)
:::

###### Health benefits section

This section is where the employee\'s health contributions are
configured. Populate each of the fields with the corresponding amount
deducted from *each paycheck* for the employee.

![The health benefits section for an employee, filled out with payslip deductions.](united_states/health.png)

###### Other benefits section

This section currently only houses a `Commuter`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} benefit field. Enter the amount being deducted per
paycheck, for applicable commuter benefits.

##### Post-tax deductions section

These types of benefits count as deductions *after* taxes are
calculated. They appear towards the end of the payslip before the net
amount is displayed. Currently, only one field, `ROTH
401(k)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears in this section.
Enter either a percentage (%) of the payslip amount, or a specific
dollar amount per payslip (\$/slip) being deducted from the employee\'s
pay, and deposited into a ROTH 401(k) account.

## Payroll configuration

Several sections within the **Payroll** app installs a Salary Structure,
Structure Type, Rules, and Parameters specific to the United States.

### Salary structures & structure types

When the **l10n_us_hr_payroll** module is
`installed <payroll/usa_apps>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, a new
`Salary Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} gets installed,
`United States: Regular Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This
structure includes one `Structure Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `United States: Regular Pay`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

The `Salary Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} contains all
the individual `salary rules <payroll/usa_apps>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} that informs the **Payroll** app how to calculate employee
payslips.

![The United States salary structure in the salary structures list.](united_states/structure-types.png)

### Salary rules {#payroll/usa_rules}

To view the salary rules that inform the salary structure what to do,
navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Structures`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and expand the `United
States: Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} group to reveal the
`United States: Regular Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
structure type. Click `United States: Regular Pay`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to view the detailed salary rules.

![The top portion of the US salary rules.](united_states/us-rules-top-half.png)

Each rule defines how pay is calculated, taking into account factors
such as commissions, bonuses, taxes, and insurance. The *logic* behind
the `United States: Regular Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
rules is as follows:

- The first four rules listed reflects all sources of income, including
  the basic wage listed on the contract
  (`Basic Salary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), plus any
  allowances, such as `Commissions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Tips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Bonuses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  ![The basic salary rules for the US localization.](united_states/first-rules.png)

- Adding up these inputs is how the gross salary
  (`Gross Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) is calculated. This
  amount is the base amount used to calculate payroll taxes.

- The next set of rules are the various pre-tax benefits and taxable
  income, such as `Medical`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} insurance
  contributions and `Commuter Benefits`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. After the employee\'s `Gross Pay`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} is calculated, Odoo deducts all the pre-tax benefits
  listed on the employee\'s contract to determine the employee\'s
  `Taxable Income`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  ![The pre-tax rules for the US localization.](united_states/pre-tax.png)

- Next, all the various tax rules are listed where both federal and
  state payroll withholdings are outlined. First, federal tax rules are
  listed, then any state rules (if any) are listed.

  ![The federal tax rules for the US localization.](united_states/irs.png)

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  The rule for federal withholdings for [Worker\'s
  Compensation]{.title-ref} appears *after* several state-specific
  withholdings are listed, and does **not** appear in the above image,
  but are listed in the rules.
  ::::

- The last rules listed are the post-tax employee deductions.

  ![The post-tax rules for the US localization.](united_states/post-tax.png)

- The `Other Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab contains
  anything else affecting payroll. This includes items to be added to
  the payslip, such as `Tips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  other deductions, such as `Child
  Support`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  ![The other inputs for the US localization.](united_states/other-inputs.png)

- The employee\'s net salary is the amount the employee receives from
  the employer. The formula to calculate the net salary is:

  $$\text{Gross Salary} + \text{Allowances} - \text{Payroll Taxes} - \text{General Deductions}$$

- Additionally, an extra section exists in payroll calculation for the
  US called [Employer Deductions]{.title-ref}, and it breaks down the
  payments the employer must make as their portion of payroll taxes.

  ![The employer deduction rules for the US localization.](united_states/employer-deductions.png)

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  The rule for employer deductions for [Worker\'s
  Compensation]{.title-ref} appears *after* several state-specific
  employer deductions are listed, and does **not** appear in the above
  image, but are listed in the rules.
  ::::

### Rule parameters

Some calculations require specific rates associated with them, or wage
caps. *Rules Parameters* are capable of listing a value, either a
percentage or a fixed amount, to reference in the salary rules.

::: example
The wage base for Social Security tax calculations has a cap for 2025,
accounted for in the [US: FICA OASDI Cap]{.title-ref} parameter.
:::

Most rules pull information stored in the parameters module to get the
rate of the rule (a percentage) and the cap (a dollar amount).

To view rule parameters, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Rule
Parameters`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Here, all rule
parameters are displayed with their linked
`Salary Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which can be
accessed. Review the parameters associated with a rule by looking for
the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the rule, and make any
edits as needed.

::: example
The Unemployment tax of a company is different from the one added by
default in Odoo. To update this, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Rule Parameters`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then, filter the results by
`FUTA (Federal Unemployment Tax Act)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, or
the name of the state that needs editing, and edit the corresponding
rate from the list.
:::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo adds updated rule parameters for the current calendar year. It is
**not** recommended to edit rule parameters **unless a federal or state
parameter has changed**, and is different from the rule parameters
created by Odoo. Check with all local and national regulations *before*
making any changes to rule parameters.
::::

## Run US payroll

Before running paypoll, the payroll officer must validate employee
`work entries
<../work_entries>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to confirm pay accuracy
and catch errors. This includes checking that all time off is approved
and any overtime is appropriate.

Work entries sync based on the employee\'s
`contract <../contracts>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} configuration.
Odoo pulls from the assigned working schedule, attendance records,
planning schedule, and approved time off.

Any `discrepencies or conflicts <payroll/conflicts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} must be resolved, then the work entries can be
`regenerated <payroll/regenerate-work-entries>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Once everything is correct, draft payslips can be
`created individually <payroll/process>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
or in `groups <../pay_runs>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, referred to
in the **Payroll** app as *Pay Runs*.

![The work entries for a pay run, with some time off entered in the work entries.](united_states/work-entries.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To cut down on the payroll officer\'s time, it is typical to process
payslips in batches, either by wage type (fixed salary vs hourly), pay
schedule (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.), department (direct cost vs.
administration), or any other grouping that best suits the company.
::::

The process of running payroll includes different actions that need to
be executed to ensure that the amount withheld from payroll taxes is
correct, the amount that the employee receives as their net salary is
correct, and the computation of hours worked reflects the employee\'s
actual hours worked, among others.

When running a payroll batch, check that the period, company, and
employees included are correct *before* starting to analyze or validate
the data.

Once the payslips are drafted, review them for accuracy. Check the
`Worked Days & Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and
ensure the listed worked time is correct, as well as any other inputs.
Add any missing inputs, such as commissions, tips, reimbursements, that
are missing.

Next, check the various totals (gross pay, employee taxes, benefits,
employer taxes, net salaries), then click
`Compute Sheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to update the salary
calculations, if there were edits. If everything is correct, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The worked days tab of a payslip.](united_states/check-payslips.png)

### Accounting check

The accounting process when running payroll has two components:
`creating journal entries
<payroll/journal>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
`registering payments <payroll/register>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

#### Journal entry creation {#payroll/journal}

After payslips are confirmed and validated, journal entries are posted
either individually, or in a batch. The journal entry is created first
as a draft.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

It must be decided if journal entries are done individually or in
batches *before* running payroll.
::::

![All payslips in a draft state.](united_states/create-draft-entry.png)

Four accounts from the US `CoA (Chart of Accounts)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} are included with the payroll localization:

- \`611000 Salaries & Wages\`: Records gross salary and the employer\'s
  portion of payroll expenses. Also groups values from rules without
  specific accounts (e.g., company-specific benefits).
- \`230100 Employee Payroll Taxes\`: Withheld taxes from employees,
  which the employer must file and pay. The partner and label columns of
  the journal entry indicate the specific tax.
- \`230200 Employer Payroll Taxes\`: Employer portion of payroll taxes
  to be filed and paid. The partner and label columns of the journal
  entry indicate the specific tax.
- \`230000 Salary Payable\`: Net salary owed to the employee.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `CoA (Chart of Accounts)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
configuration is done by default when a company is located in the US.
The account codes and names can be edited to suit the company\'s needs.
If there is no `CoA (Chart of Accounts)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
account associated with a salary rule (used in a salary structure), Odoo
uses the account [Salary Expenses]{.title-ref} to create the journal
entry, regardless of the nature of the move.
::::

If everything seems correct on the journal entry draft, post the journal
entries.

![Journal entries posted.](united_states/post-entries.png)

### Register Payments {#payroll/register}

After the `journal entries <payroll/journal>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are validated, Odoo can generate payments.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To generate payments from payslips,employee\'s **must** have a *trusted*
bank account. If the employee\'s bank account is *not* marked as
[trusted]{.title-ref}, NACHA files **cannot** be generated through Odoo.
::::

Payments can be `Grouped by Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
if there is a partner associated with a salary rule.

![Payslips with a status of paid.](united_states/paid.png)

### Close Payroll

If there are no errors, payroll is completed for the pay period.

## Reports

The US localization contains several reports unique to the US, which
provide tax information for employees, as well as the ability to
integrate with outside organizations such as ADP.

### W2 Report

The *W2 Report* provides a CSV file that allows employees to e-file
their W2 report with third-party software. To access this report,
navigate to `Payroll -> Reporting -> United States
-> W2`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

To create a W2 form, click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
a blank `Create W2 Form`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page loads.
Set the `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (typically a calendar
year), and select the `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, if
in a multi-company database.

All pay runs for the time period appear in a list view. To add any
missing pay runs, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
at the bottom of the list, and select the missing files.

When done, click the `Generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button to create a CSV file with a summary of all payroll related
payments made during the specified time period.

![The W2 report screen, with the file to download in the top half.](united_states/w2.png)

### Form 941

The *Form 941* report is meant to inform the government of the amount of
federal income tax,
`FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} taxes (Medicare and Social Security) withheld from employee
paychecks. It also reports the employee\'s side of taxes.

To create this report, navigate to
`Payroll -> Reporting -> United States -> Form
941`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and a new

### Export data to third-party apps

The *ADP Export* report generates a CSV file that can be submitted to
ADP, which then makes payments to the employees.

The CSV file summarizes the employee\'s worked hours during a specified
time period, correlating to their salary or hourly wage. The report is
generated from `work entry <../work_entries>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} *after* any time off is confirmed.

The export format is meant to match with the ADP format. Since companies
can customize their portal and may require some changes, the data is
there to be fed to ADP to run payroll in it.

:::: important

To access the ADP Export report, the [United States - Payroll - Export
to ADP]{.title-ref} module **must** be
`installed <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

# Payroll localizations

*Localizations* are country-specific settings preconfigured in Odoo at
the creation of the database, which account for all taxes, fees, and
allowances for that particular country.

*Payroll localizations* refer to the specific process of adapting
payroll systems, policies, and compliance measures to align with the
specific labor laws, tax regulations, and social security requirements
of a particular country or region.

This ensures that employee salaries, benefits, deductions, and
contributions are processed accurately and in full compliance with local
legal and financial obligations.

Localization also includes integrating country-specific payroll elements
such as benefits, holidays, termination rules, and reporting
requirements, helping businesses avoid legal risks while ensuring
employees receive their correct compensation.

## Install localization package

A country-specific localization module
`must be installed <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to
properly configure and process payroll. To install the required module,
first open the **Apps** app.

Clear out the default `fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Apps`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter, then type the name of
the desired country into the search bar. All available modules for that
country are presented.

::: example
Some countries only have one localization module, while other have
multiple modules. This is typically when other software is neede to
process payroll, and importing and exporting data is required.

For example. when searching for **Payroll** modules for
[Egypt]{.title-ref}, the following modules appear in the search, and
must be installed: [Egypt - Payroll]{.title-ref} and [Egypt - Payroll
with Accounting]{.title-ref}.

Refer to the
`country-specific documentation <payroll_localizations/countries-list>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for a complete list of the related **Payroll** modules
required for each specific country.
:::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To see if any localization modules have been installed on the database,
navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. In the `Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, if a localization module was installed, a
`(Country) Localization`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section
appears.
::::

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

It is **not** recommended to alter the localization settings, unless
specifically required.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Odoo can handle a multi-company configuration. This is generally done
when there is a main company or office location, such as a headquarters,
and there are other offices/branches around the country or globe, that
fall under that main company or headquarters. In Odoo, each company,
including the headquarters, must be set up as their own company/branch
using the multi-company method.

Each individual company can have a different localization setting, since
locations can vary anywhere in the world, where rules and laws differ.

For more information on companies, refer to the
`Companies <../../general/companies>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation, which covers how to set up companies.

# Payslips

*Payslips* are individual records of payment, containing all the details
of how the pay was calculated (hours, deductions, other inputs, etc.),
and generated by payroll officers through the **Payroll** application.
Payslips can be created and processed individually, or multiple payslips
can be processed at one time, in a single batch.

## Create a payslip {#payroll/new-payslip}

A new payslip can be created from either the
`Payslips To Pay <payroll/to-pay>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} page or
the `Employee Payslips <payroll/all-payslips>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} page.

Navigate to `Payroll app --> Payslips`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click either `To Pay`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `All Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
top-left corner, and a blank payslip form loads.

### Payslip form

Fill out the following information on the payslip form:

- `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the employee in this field. This field is **required**.
  Once a selection is made, other fields may auto-populate according to
  the employee record.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  It is recommended to **only** create payslips for employees that are
  already in the database. If there is no current employee record (and
  therefore no employee contract) it is recommended to create the new
  employee in the **Employees** application *before* creating payslips
  for that employee. Refer to the
  `new employee <../employees/new_employee>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} documentation for instructions on how to add an employee.
  ::::

- `Contract`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The current contract
  for the selected employee populates this field. This field is
  **required**.

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  All employees are required to have a contract in order to generate
  payslips. Additionally, *only one* contract can be in the running
  stage for each employee, therefore the current contract populates this
  field, and it is **not** recommended to make changes to this field.
  ::::

- `Batch`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down menu,
  select the payslip batch this new payslip should be added to, if
  applicable.

- `Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The structure linked
  to the employee\'s contract auto-populates this field by default. If
  desired, use the drop-down menu to select a different structure.

- `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The first day to the last
  day of the *current* month auto-populates the
  `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields by default. The
  dates can be changed, if desired.

  To change the start date, click on the first date in the
  `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to reveal a pop-up
  calendar. Navigate to the desired month, and click on the desired day
  to select that specific date.

  Repeat this process to modify the end date for the payslip. These
  fields are **required**.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Typically, after making a selection in the `Employee`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, Odoo auto-populates all other required fields
(besides the `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field), but
**only** if that information is already on that employee\'s form in the
**Employees** app.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If modifications to auto-populated fields are made, it is recommended to
check with the accounting department to ensure every entry that affects
the **Accounting** application is correct.
::::

![The top fields for a new payslip all filled out for a February payslip.](payslips/new-payslip.png)

#### Worked days & inputs tab {#payroll/worked-days-inputs}

The `Worked Days & Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
details the number of days and hours the employee worked during the
specified `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of time on the top
portion of the payslip form, and is calculated based on the selected
`Contract`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields.

The `Worked Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section is
automatically populated and lists all the individual attendance records
for the time period, including both worked time and any time off taken.

Each individual entry lists the `Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Number of
Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Number of Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the total
`Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Additional records cannot be created for the
`Worked Days & Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as it is
auto-populated according to the employee\'s attendance records or
working schedule on their
`employee record <employees/work-info-tab>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

The `Other Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section is where
additional inputs are listed, such as deductions, reimbursements, and
expenses.

Each individual item lists the `Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To add a new input, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and using the drop-down
menu, select the `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Next, enter
a brief `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and last,
enter the `Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The fields filled out in the worked days and inputs tab.](payslips/worked-days-tab.png)

#### Salary computation tab

The `Salary Computation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab is where
all the individual salary rules are listed and calculated, including
everything from the employee\'s salary, to all the deductions and
allowances, such as taxes, expenses, benefit contributions, and any
other items associated with the installed
`payroll localization <payroll_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

When the payslip is first created, this tab remains blank. Click the
`Compute Sheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
upper-left corner, and the `Salary Computation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab is populated.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

It is **not** possible to make edits to this tab, as the calculations
are based on other entries on the payslip.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The `Compute Sheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button does not
disappear from view after it is clicked, so the payslip can be
recalculated at any point prior to
`processing it <payroll/process>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

If any changes need to be made to the
`Worked Days & Inputs <payroll/worked-days-inputs>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} tab, click the `Compute Sheet`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to recalculate the payslip.
::::

![The fields filled out in the salary computation tab.](payslips/salary-comp-tab.png)

#### Other info tab

The `Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab houses
information that is required, but not associated with any inputs or
calculations, as the other tabs do.

The `Payslip Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is auto-populated
according to the employee name and the time period the payslip is for.
Make any desired edits to the name in this field. This field is
**required**.

The `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is also
automatically populated according to the employee\'s record, and cannot
be modified.

The end date selected in the `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field in the top half of the form populates both the
`Close Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Date Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields, by default.
The `Close Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is the date the
payment is issued to the employee, while the
`Date Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is the end date the
payslip covers. Modify the dates, if needed.

The `Salary Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
populated by default, and **cannot** be edited. This is the accounting
journal the paycheck is logged in.

If there are any additional notes or information needed for the payslip,
add them to the `Add an Internal Note...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

![The fields filled out in the other info tab.](payslips/other-info-tab.png)

## Process a payslip {#payroll/process}

When all the necessary information on the payslip is entered, the
payslip can be processed. First, a
`draft of the journal entry <payroll/draft-entry>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} is created, followed by a `payment
report <payroll/payment-report>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
finally, the employee is `paid <payroll/pay-employee>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Before processing payslips, it is best practice to check the *Warnings*
section of the **Payroll** app dashboard. Here, all possible issues
concerning payroll appear.

To view the warnings, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. The
warnings appear in the top-left corner of the dashboard.

![The dashboard view of the Payroll app, with the warnings box visible.](payslips/warnings.png)

Warnings are grouped by type, such as [Employees Without Running
Contracts]{.title-ref} or [Employees Without Bank account
Number]{.title-ref}. Click on a warning to view all entries associated
with that specific issue.

If the warnings are not resolved, at any point in the payslip processing
process, an error may occur. Errors appear in a pop-up window, and
provide details for the error, and how to resolve them.
::::

### Create draft entry {#payroll/draft-entry}

Once everything on the payslip form is correct, click the
`Create Draft Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to create
the payslip. A `Confirmation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window appears, asking `Are you sure
you want to proceed?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} Click
`OK`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm.

Once the payslip draft is created, the status changes to
`Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a `fa-usd`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Journal Entry (Draft)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
smart button appears at the top, and additional buttons appear in the
top-left corner.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

After creating a draft entry, Odoo considers the payslip as confirmed.
::::

Click the `fa-usd`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Journal Entry (Draft)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button
to view the detailed accounting journal entry. Click
`Post`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to post the entry. Using the
breadcrumb menu, return to the payslip.

After the journal entry is posted, the smart button at the top changes
to `fa-usd`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Journal Entry (Posted)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Employees cannot be `paid <payroll/pay-employee>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} until the journal entry is posted.
::::

### Create payment report {#payroll/payment-report}

Once the payslip status has changed to `Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, a payment report must be created. A payment report is
a document that contains all the necessary information to transfer the
employee\'s earnings from the company\'s bank account to theirs. These
are submitted by the payroll department to the appropriate institution.

Click the `Create Payment Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
a pop-up window loads. Using the drop-down menu, select the
`Export Format`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the payment
report. The two default options available are `NACHA`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `CSV`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
`NACHA`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stands for the
`National Automated
Clearing House Association (NACHA)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, and
this selection creates a compatible ACH file which is sent to the
company\'s bank.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Other options may be available depending on the `payroll localization
<payroll_localizations>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} installed in the
database.

If `CSV`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, all other
fields are hidden from view.
::::

Next, select the desired `Bank Journal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} the paycheck is logged to. Last, using the calendar
selector, set the date the paycheck is issued in the
`Effective Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Once the pop-up window is configured, click the
`Generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and the file
appears on the payslip form, in a new `Payment Report`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

### Pay employee {#payroll/pay-employee}

Next, the payment must be sent to the employee. To do this, click the
`Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the upper-left
corner. Doing so reveals a `Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up form.

All the necessary information is pre-populated on the form according to
the payslip configuration, but modifications can be made, if necessary,
to any of the fields *except* the `Amount`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. This is populated according to the payslip
calculations, and **cannot** be modified.

- `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The accounting journal
  the payslip is logged to.
- `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  drop-down menu, select how the employee is being paid. The default
  options are:
  - `Manual Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this if
    paying the employee in a method *other* than A
    `Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `NACHA`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  - `Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this when issuing
    a check directly to the employee.
  - `NACHA`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this if using the
    `National Automated Clearing House Association
    (NACHA)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to transfer the payment to
    the employee, via direct deposit.
- `Group Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the employee
  has multiple payslips for the same time period (for example, payroll,
  reimbursement, and commission checks), tick the checkbox to group all
  payments into one payment.
- `Payment Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the calendar
  selector, select the date the employee is to be paid.

Once the pop-up `Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form is
complete, click the `Create Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button, and the payment is processed.

After the payment is processed, and there is confirmation that the
checks have been issued, or the funds have been directly deposited to
the employee\'s bank account, click the `Mark as
paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to mark the payslip as
paid.

![Banking information can be entered in an employee\'s card.](payslips/pay.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

In order for a payslip to be paid, the employee **must** have a bank
account entered in the
`private information tab <employees/private-info>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} of their employee record, *and* the bank account must be
marked as `Trusted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If there is no bank information, or if the bank is not listed as
`Trusted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, payslips cannot be paid,
and an error appears when the `Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button is clicked. Edit the employee record, and add banking
information, or trust the bank account, as needed.
::::

## Refund a payslip

When refunding a payment, the refund is achieved by creating a payslip
for a negative amount of the original payslip.

::: example
An employee is paid \$5,000.00 USD in a paycheck, in error. When
refunding the payslip, a new payslip is created in the amount of
\$-5,000.00.
:::

If a payment needs to be refunded, navigate to the individual payslip
being refunded, and click the `Refund`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, located at the top-left of the screen. The
`Refund Payslip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard loads,
with all refund payslips appearing in a list view.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Since refunds are uncommon, typically only the one payslip being
refunded appears in the list.
::::

By default, the refund payslip has a status of
`Waiting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This refund payslip is
processed
`in the same way a regular payslip is processed <payroll/process>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

## Print a payslip

To print a payslip, click the `Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button in the upper-left corner of the individual payslip record. A PDF
file is downloaded, and the payslip appears in the chatter, and the file
is attached to the payslip record.

![The new payslip is emailed to the employee and the email appears in the chatter.](payslips/payslip-chatter.png)

## View all payslips {#payroll/all-payslips}

To view all payslips, regardless of status, go to
`Payroll app --> Payslips --> All
Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. The
`Employee Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page loads,
displaying all payslips, organized by batch, in a default nested list
view.

Click the `▶ (right arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} next to
an individual batch name to expand the list, and view all the payslips
in that particular batch, along with all the payslip details.

The number of payslips in the batch is written in parenthesis after the
batch name. The `Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for each
individual payslip appears on the far-right side, indicating one of the
following status options:

- `Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the payslip is created,
  and there is still time to make edits, since the amounts are not
  calculated.
- `Waiting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the payslip has been
  calculated, and the salary details can be found in the *Salary
  Computation* tab.
- `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the payslip is calculated
  and ready to be paid.
- `Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the employee has been paid.

![View all payslips organized by batches. Click on the arrow to expand each batch.](payslips/all-payslips.png)

Click on an individual payslip to view the details for that payslip on a
separate page. Using the breadcrumb menu, click
`Employee Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to go back to the
list view of all payslips.

A new payslip can be created from the
`Employee Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, by clicking
the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the upper-left
corner. Doing so reveals a separate blank payslip form page. On that
blank payslip form page, enter all the necessary information, as
described in the
`Create a payslip <payroll/new-payslip>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
section.

Payslips can also be exported to an Excel spreadsheet. To export **all**
payslips, click on the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(gear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon at the end of the words
`Employee Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the top-left
corner. This reveals a drop-down menu. Click
`fa-upload`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Export All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to export all payslips
to a spreadsheet.

To export only select payslips, first select the payslips to be exported
from the list. Then, click the checkbox to the left of each individual
payslip to select it. As payslips are selected, a smart button appears
in the top-center of the page, indicating the number of selected
payslips. Then, click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the top-center of
the page, and click `fa-upload`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Export`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

<payroll/other-input>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Together, these
determine how each employee\'s pay is calculated.

Each *structure type* contains one or more *structures* within it. Each
*structure* contains a set of *rules*, and every *rule* uses
*parameters* to define how specific amounts are calculated. Additional
inputs, (such as bonuses or deductions) can also be included to adjust
the final salary.

When payslips are calculated, Odoo calculates the employee\'s worked
time from their `work
entries <work_entries>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, then applies the
relevant structure, rules, and parameters from the employee\'s assigned
structure type to determine their total pay.

## Structure types {#payroll/structure-types}

In Odoo, a *structure type* groups related salary structures. When a
contract specifies a structure type, **only** the structures within that
type are used to calculate the employee\'s pay. Each structure type
houses individual structures within them, each containing a set of rules
for processing a timesheet entry.

Structure types define key aspects of payroll configuration, including
how often employees are paid, their working hours, the default salary
structure, and whether wages are fixed (salary-based) or variable
(hourly-based).

::: example
A structure type called [Employee]{.title-ref} contains two different
structures within it: a [Regular Pay]{.title-ref} structure which
includes all the separate rules for processing regular pay, and an [End
of Year Bonus]{.title-ref} structure, which includes the rules **only**
for the end of year bonus. Both belong to the same
[Employee]{.title-ref} structure type.
:::

View existing *structure types* by navigating to
`Payroll app --> Configuration -->
Structure Types`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Two default structure types are preconfigured in Odoo:
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Worker`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Typically, `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is used for
salaried employees, which is why the `Default
Wage Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is a
`Fixed Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Worker`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is typically used for
employees paid by the hour, so the wage type is
`Hourly Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note

Note
:::

If using a country-specific
`payroll localizations <payroll_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, it is recommended to use the structure in the corresponding
country localization document.

  [Worker]{.title-ref}.
- `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the country that
  the new structure type applies to from the drop-down menu.
- `Wage Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the wage type
  for the structure:
  - `Fixed Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: For salaried
    employees who receive the same wage every pay period.
  - `Hourly Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: For employees paid
    based on hours worked during a pay period.
- `Default Scheduled Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  typical pay schedule for the new structure type from the drop-down
  menu. This indicates how often this specific type of structure is paid
  out.
- `Default Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  default working hours for the new structure type from the drop-down
  menu. All available working hours for the currently selected company
  appear in the drop-down menu. The default working hours are the
  `Standard 40 hours/week`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. If

![New structure type form to fill out when creating a new structure type.](salaries/new-structure.png)

### New default working hours {#payroll/new-default-working-hours}

To make new default working hours, type the name for the new working
hours in the `Default
Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the new
structure type form. Click `Create and edit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. A default working hours form pops up. The default
working hours form has two sections: a general information section, and
a tab listing all the individual working hours by day and time. When the
form is completed, click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Type in the name for the
  new default working hours. This should be descriptive and clear to
  understand, such as [Standard 20 Hours/Week]{.title-ref}.

- `Flexible Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Check the
  checkbox to let employees adjust their start and end times while
  maintaining the same total daily hours.

- `Company Full Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  number of hours per week an employee needs to work to be considered a
  full-time employee. Typically, this is approximately 40 hours, and
  this number affects what types of benefits an employee can receive,
  based on their employment status (full-time vs part-time).

- `Average Hour Per Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  Auto-populated based on the working hours in the
  `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. This entry
  affects resource planning by determining how many resources can be
  used per workday.

- `Work Time Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This percentage
  is auto-generated based on the entry for the
  `Company Full Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the working
  hours configured in the `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} tab. This number should be between
  [0.00%]{.title-ref} and [100%]{.title-ref}, so if the percentage is
  above [100%]{.title-ref}, it is an indication that the working times
  and/or `Company Full Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} hours
  need adjustment.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the company that
  can use these new default working hours from the drop-down menu. Leave
  this field blank if the hours are available for all companies.

- `Timezone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the time zone to
  be used for the new default working hours from the drop-down menu.

- `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} Tab: This tab is
  where each day\'s specific working hours are listed. When a new
  default working hour form is created, the
  `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab is
  pre-populated with a default 40-hour week, with each day divided into
  three timed sections.

  Each day includes morning (8:00--12:00), lunch (12:00--13:00), and
  afternoon (13:00--17:00) periods, configured using the 24-hour time
  format.

  To adjust any of these hours, click the field and modify the time
  using the drop-down menus, or type the desired time directly.

## Structures {#payroll/structures}

*Salary structures* are the different situations in which an employee
could be paid within a specific *structure*, and are specifically
defined by various rules.

The number of structures a company needs for each structure type depends
on how many different ways employees are paid, and how their pay is
calculated. A common example of an additional structure is a
[Bonus]{.title-ref}.

To view all the various structures for each structure type, go to
`Payroll app -->
Configuration --> Structures`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Each `structure type <payroll/structure-types>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} lists the various structures associated with it. Each
structure contains a set of rules that define it.

![All available salary structures.](salaries/salary-structure.png)

Click on a structure to view its `Salary Rules`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. These rules define how the payslip will be computed
for the employee.

After installing a
`payroll localization <payroll_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, relevant structures are installed and appear in this list.
::::

![Salary structure details for Regular Pay, listing all the specific Salary Rules.](salaries/structure-regular-pay-rules.png)

## Salary rules {#payroll/rules}

Each *structure* has a set of salary *rules* used to compute the various
amounts considered in the pay. These rules are configured by the
localization and affect the computation of the salaries.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Modification or creation of rules should **only** be done when
necessary.
::::

To view all the rules, go to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Rules`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click on a structure (such as
`Regular Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) to view all the rules.

### Add a new rule

To make a new rule, click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a
blank `Salary Rules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form loads.
Enter the following information in the top half of the form:

- `Rule Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a name for the
  rule. This is the name displayed in the payslip.
- `Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a code to be used for
  the new rule. This is case sensitive and is used as the *rule ID*.
  This field is **required**.
- `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the category the rule applies to, or enter a new
  category. The category is used to group rules and access their total
  sum.
- `Salary Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  drop-down menu, select the salary structure the rule applies to, or
  enter a new one. This field is **required**.
- `Sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a number
  indicating *when* the rule is calculated, in the sequence of all other
  rules. Rules are processed one after another based on their sequence
  number. Rules with a lower sequence number are calculated first, and
  their results can be used by rules with a higher sequence number. This
  field is **required**.
- `Appears on Payslip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Check the
  checkbox to have the rule visible on the employee payslip PDF.
- `Contributes to Employer Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  Check the checkbox to include the rule when computing the *employer
  cost* of a payslip.

#### General tab

Fill out the following sections of the `General`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. These configurations determine *when* and *how*
the rule is calculated.

##### Conditions

- `Condition Based on`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  drop-down menu, select if the rule is calculated and displayed as a
  line in the payslip form view. Choose from one of the following
  options:
  - `Always True`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The rule is always
    calculated. No other configurations are needed for this section.

  - `Salary Input`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This introduces a
    dynamic benefit to the structure. This appears as a field in the
    *Payroll* tab of the *Employee* form, the *Inputs* tab of the
    payslip, or both. The value of this field is added to the amount of
    the rule. If selected, the following additional fields appear and
    must be configured:

    - `Input on`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Specify where this
      field should appear and which object it should belong to, the
      `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
      `Payslip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or both. If both are
      selected, the value on the payslip automatically defaults to the
      value from the employee record, but it can be overwritten directly
      on the payslip for a specific payroll run.

    - `Section`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This groups several
      inputs into one expandable section on the form view. Only one
      option is available by default, `Inputs`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"}.

    - `Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Click the corresponding
      radio button to determine how the benefit is displayed. The
      available options are:

      - `Monetary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A number with
        currency.
      - `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A number.
      - `Percentage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A number with a
        % sign.
      - `Checkbox`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Indicates boolean
        values.

    - `Input Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a
      short explanation of when the input is applicable.

    - `Default Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
      default value, either a monetary amount, quantity, or percentage.
      This is determined by what is selected for the
      `Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If necessary, add a
      `Suffix`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the field to the
      right of this value, such as [per km]{.title-ref}.

# Salary adjustments

Salary adjustments are portions of earnings taken directly out of a
payslip for a specific purpose, whether voluntary or required.

When the deduction is voluntary, they are typically considered
*deductions*. When the deduction is court-ordered, or involuntary, it is
sometimes referred to as a *wage garnishment*. In Odoo, these are all
universally called *salary adjustments*.

Note that salary adjustments can also be used to give recurring amounts
of money to employees, like a bonus divided into multiple payments.

## Salary adjustment types {#payroll/salary-adjustment/types}

To view the currently configured salary adjustment types, navigate to
`Payroll app
--> Configuration --> Other Input Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. This displays *all* other salary inputs, not only
the various salary adjustments.

The three default salary adjustment types that appear in this list are:
`Attachment of
Salary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Assignment of Salary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Child Support`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Each salary adjustment type displays the `Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of the adjustment type, and the
`Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} used when calculating
payslips.

![The default salary adjustment types.](salary_attachments/adjustment-types.png)

### Create new salary adjustment types

:::: danger
::: title
Danger
:::

Upon installation of the **Payroll** application, the preconfigured
default salary adjustment types are linked to a variety of rules that
are linked to various salary structures, as well as the installed
`localization package <fiscal_localizations/packages>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

It is **not** recommended to alter or modify **any** of the
preconfigured salary adjustment types, especially if they have been
previously used on payslips in the database. Doing so may affect various
salary rules, and can prevent the creation of payslips.

A new salary adjustment type *can* be created, but this should only be
done when absolutely necessary. A salary adjustment type **must** be
linked to a salary rule to be considered in the salary computation.
::::

To make a new type of salary adjustment, click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and a blank
`Payslip Other Input Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form
loads. Enter the `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
the new salary adjustment type in the corresponding field. Next, tick
the `Available in
adjustments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox, indicating it
is available to use as a salary adjustment. Enter the
`Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} used in the salary rules to
compute payslips. Lastly, if the salary adjustment type should **only**
be used in a specific payroll structure, use the drop-down menu in the
`Available in Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and
select the specific structure.

## Create a salary adjustment {#payroll/salary-adjustment/create}

All salary adjustments must be configured separately for each employee,
for each type of salary adjustment. To view the currently configured
salary adjustments, navigate to `Payroll
app --> Employees --> Salary Adjustments`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

All salary adjustments appear in a default list view, and displays the
name of the `Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a descriptive
`Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the salary adjustment
`Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. An
`Until`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column appears as well, which
details when the salary adjustment ends, either a monetary amount to be
reached, or `Indefinite`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if the
adjustment has no end.

At the end of each line is a status tag, with a green
`Running`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tag for active adjustments,
or `Closed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for adjustments that have
ended.

To create a new salary adjustment, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the top-left corner, and a blank
`Salary Adjustment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form loads. Enter
the following information on the form:

- `Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the desired employees. Multiple employees can be listed
  in this field.

- `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down menu,
  select the specific `salary adjustment type
  <payroll/salary-adjustment/types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

- `Payslip Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the amount
  taken out of each paycheck in this field.

- `Negative Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick this
  checkbox if the salary adjustment is taken into account as a negative
  value.

- `Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the length of
  time for the salary adjustment. The options are:

  - `One Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Only one payment is
    taken from the employee\'s paycheck.
  - `Limited`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The employee is paying
    a specific monetary amount in total, divided up among multiple
    paychecks.
  - `Unlimited`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The employee is
    making recurring payments towards something with no end point, such
    as contributions to a retirement fund, or a donation to a charity.
  - `from`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the calendar
    selector, select the date the salary adjustment goes into effect.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  If the `Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set to
  `Limited`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, an `until (amount)
  paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears. Enter the
  monetary amount that must be reached, before the salary adjustment
  ends.
  ::::

- `Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a short description
  of the salary adjustment.

![The salary adjustment form with all fields filled out.](salary_attachments/salary-adjustment-form.png)

Since the salary adjustment form auto-saves as the fields are populated,
after making a salary adjustment for an individual employee, there is no
further action required.

If creating salary adjustments for multiple employees on a single salary
adjustment form, after the form is filled out, click the
`Create Individual Attachments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button. This creates separate salary adjustments for each of the
employees listed in the `Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

After the separate salary adjustments have been created, the screen
returns to the `Salary
Adjustment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, but with a
`Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter, populated with the
information filled in the `Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field on the salary adjustment form. All the salary adjustments have a
status of `Running`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, since they are
currently active. Clear the filter in the search box to view the default
`Salary Adjustment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard in its
entirety.

## Manage salary adjustments

Salary adjustments can have one of two statuses, *Running* or *Closed*.
To view the current status of all salary adjustments, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Employees --> Salary
Adjustments`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

All salary adjustments appear in chronological order, by
`Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, with the most recent
appearing at the top. To view the salary adjustments by a particular
metric, such as the `Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click on the column title to
sort by that specific column.

![All salary adjustments, organized by start date.](salary_attachments/adjustments-list.png)

### Closed salary adjustments

When a salary adjustment is created, it has a status of
`Running`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Once the salary adjustment
is finished (the *Until* amount entered on the `salary adjustment form
<payroll/salary-adjustment/create>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} has
been paid in full), the status automatically changes to *Closed*, and
the employee no longer has money taken out of future paychecks.

If a salary adjustment has been fulfilled, but has not automatically
changed to *Closed*, the record can be manually updated. To change the
status, open the *Salary Adjustment* dashboard by navigating to
`Payroll app --> Employees --> Salary Adjustments`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Click on the record to update, and the detailed
`Salary Adjustment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form loads. On
the individual `Salary Adjustment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
record, click the `Mark as Completed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button in the upper-left corner, and the status changes to
`Closed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: example
The following is an example of when a payroll manager may need to
manually change a salary adjustment from `Running`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to `Closed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Rose Smith has a salary adjustment for a lawsuit settlement, where she
is required to pay \$3,000.00. A salary adjustment is created that takes
\$250.00 a month out of Rose\'s paycheck, to go towards this settlement
payment.

After six months, Rose has paid \$1,500.00 from her salary. She receives
a tax refund, and uses the money to pay off the remainder of the lawsuit
settlement. After sending the relevant documentation to the payroll
manager, showing the settlement has been paid in full, the payroll
manager manually changes the status of her salary adjustment to
`Closed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Time off to report

Payroll is often processed a few days before the end of a pay period, so
that employees can be paid in a timely manner. When work schedules are
predictable, this method often works. However, sometimes employees take
time off unexpectedly, especially sick time. When this occurs, there can
be discrepancies in payroll that must be addressed.

::: example
The payroll department for a medium-sized company processes paychecks
every two weeks, on Wednesdays. Each employee is paid on the Friday
after.

One employee is sick on the last Thursday and Friday of the two-week pay
period. Since they have automatically generated work entries based on
their working schedule, and payroll is processed on Wednesdays, the
paycheck they receive incorrectly states that they were paid for a
regular work day for all ten days of the two-week pay period.

Instead of cancelling the paycheck and reissuing it, causing delays for
the employee and more work for the payroll department, Odoo allows for
the deferral of the time off taken, to the following pay period.

This ensures all time off balances are correct, and the employee is
properly compensated for their time.
:::

## Time off dashboard {#payroll/time-off-dashboard}

When time off requests are submitted for a time period that was already
processed on a payslip, the time off requests appear in the *Time Off*
page of the **Payroll** app. To access this, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Work Entries --> Time Off to Report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

The `Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page default filter is
`To Defer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and displays all requests
with a `Payslip State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of
`To defer to next payslip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This is
because the employee was *already paid* for that time as worked time,
and it was logged as regular time spent at work.

![A list of all time off requests that were not approved before payslips were generated.](time_off_to_report/time-off-to-report.png)

## Defer multiple time off entries

In order to keep the employee\'s time off balances correct, the time off
request **must** be applied to the following pay period. This not only
ensures time off request balances are current, it also eliminates the
need to redo work entries, cancel paychecks, and reissue paychecks.

To select the work entries to defer, tick the box to the left of the
work entry line on the
`Time Off page <payroll/time-off-dashboard>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. To select all work entries in the list, tick the box to the
left of the `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column title,
at the top of the list.

Once any work entry is selected, two buttons appear at the top of the
report: a `(#)
selected`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and an
`fa-gear`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. The `(#) selected`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button indicates how many entries are currently
selected.

When all the desired work entries are selected, click the
`fa-gear`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, and a menu appears with several choices. Click
`Defer to Next Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the list,
and all selected entries are deferred to the following month.

## Defer individual time off entries

Time off requests appearing on the
`Time Off page <payroll/time-off-dashboard>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} can be deferred individually. Click on an individual time
off request, and the details for that request load.

The specific details for the time off request appear on the left-hand
side, and all of the employee\'s submitted time off requests appear on
the right-hand side (including the request in the details on the
left-hand side).

To defer the time off request to the next payslip, click the
`Report to Next Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
upper-left corner. Once processed, the
`Report to Next Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
disappears, and the `Payslip State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
changes from `To defer to next payslip`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to `Computed in Current Payslip`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![The time off details for an individual request that needs to be deferred.](time_off_to_report/single-defer.png)

# Work entries

A *work entry* is an individual record on an employee\'s timesheet. Work
entries can be configured to account for all types of work and time off,
such as `Attendance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Sick Time
Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Training`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Public Holiday`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

The **Payroll** app automatically creates work entries based on the
employee\'s `salary
structure type <payroll/structure-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
and from the **Planning**, **Attendances**, and **Time Off**
applications. When needed, work entries can also be `created manually
<payroll/new-work-entry>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Work entries provide the **Payroll** app with the worked hours used to
compute employee paychecks, if the employee\'s salary is based on work
entries, as opposed to a salaried position.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Odoo configures several work entry types by default, but
`additional work entry types can be
created <payroll/work-entry-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, when
necessary.
::::

## Work entry dashboard {#payroll/work-entry-dashboard}

The *Work Entries* dashboard of the **Payroll** app provides a visual
overview of the individual work entries for every employee.

To open the dashboard, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Work Entries --> Work Entries`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

On the `Work Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, work
entries appear in alphabetical order, based on the first name of the
employees. The entire month is displayed, with the current day
highlighted in pale yellow.

The `Work Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard has a
default `Conflicting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter, which
displays only work entries with
`conflicts <payroll/conflicts>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to be
resolved.

![Conflicts dashboard view showing all employee\'s conflicts in work entries.](work_entries/work-entries-overview.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Remove the default `Conflicting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
filter from the search bar to view *all* work entries.
::::

## Add a new work entry {#payroll/new-work-entry}

If a work entry is missing, such as sick time, or if an employee forgot
to clock in and out for a shift, a new work entry must be created for
the missing shift.

Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
`work entry dashboard <payroll/work-entry-dashboard>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and a blank `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
work entry pop-up form appears. Enter the following information on the
form:

- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a short
  description for the work entry, such as [Sick Time]{.title-ref}. The
  default entry is [Attendance: (Employee)]{.title-ref}.

- `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the employee the
  work entry is for, using the drop-down menu.

- `Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  `Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} using the
  drop-down menu.

- `From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `To`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: Enter the start (`From`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}) and end (`To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"})
  dates and times for the work entry.

  First, click on either the `From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  or `To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line to reveal a calendar
  pop-up window. Select the date by navigating to the correct month,
  then click on the specific day to select it.

  Next, select the time, by clicking on either the hour or minute fields
  at the bottom of the calendar, and set the desired time.

  When the date and time for the entry are correct, click the
  `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

- `Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field displays the
  hours based on the `To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} entries. Modifying this
  field modifies the `To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field (the
  `From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field does not change).

Once the desired information is entered, click
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the entry, and
close the pop-up form.

![Filling in the work entry Create form in Odoo.](work_entries/create.png)

## Conflicts {#payroll/conflicts}

A conflict occurs when a request has not been approved, such as sick
time or vacation, or if there are any errors on the work entry.
Conflicts that span the current pay period being processed **must** be
resolved before payslips can be generated.

Any work entry that has a conflict to be resolved is indicated on the
main `Work Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, which
can be accessed by navigating to `Payroll app --> Work Entries -->
Work Entries`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Only conflicts
needing resolution are shown by default.

Conflicts are indicated with an orange triangle in the top-left corner
of each individual work entry. Click on an individual work entry to see
the date and time for the specific work entry, then click
`Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to view the conflict details
in a pop-up window.

![A row of conflicts, with one entry showing details for the conflict.](work_entries/conflict-pop-up.png)

The conflict is briefly explained in an orange text box in the
`Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window that appears.

The `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are listed on the
left side of the pop-up window. The `From`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} date and
time range, as well as the total time (in hours) in the
`Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, appears on the
right side.

### Time off conflicts

The most common work entry conflicts are for time off requests. Odoo
automatically generates work entries for specific time periods. When
time off is requested after these work entries are generated, it results
in duplicate work entries for that employee (one for time off and
another for regular work).

If there is a conflict because a time off request is in the system for
the same time that a regular work entry already exists, the time off
request is entered in a `Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

Conflicts can be resolved either directly on the work entry or in the
detailed time off request form.

#### Resolve on work entry {#payroll/time-off-work-entry}

If no additional details are needed to determine if a time off request
should be approved or refused, the time off conflict can be resolved
directly from the work entry pop-up window.

Click either the `Refuse Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Approve Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons to refuse
or approve the time off request, then the two buttons disappear. Click
the `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to close
the pop-up window.

The conflict disappears from the `Work Entry`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard, since the conflict is now resolved.

![The detailed conflict pop-up window that appears when the Edit button is clicked.](work_entries/conflict-details.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the time off is approved, the status of the work entry conflict
changes to `Cancelled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If the time
off is refused, the status changes to `Draft`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

#### Resolve on time off request {#payroll/time-off-request-form}

If more details are needed to make a decision about the time off
request, hover over the entry in the `Time Off`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, and click the
`fa-external-link`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Internal Link)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon that appears
at the end of the line. This causes an
`Open: Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window to
load, with all the time off request details. Click either the
`Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons to approve or refuse
the request.

To resolve the time off conflict on the detailed time off request pop-up
window, click the `Internal Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button at the end of the `Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
entry line, and the time off request details appear in a new pop-up
window. The request can be modified, if needed.

Click the `Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to approve
the request, then click the `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to save the changes, and go back to the work
entry conflict pop-up window.

![The detailed time off request information.](work_entries/entry-details.png)

Now, the `Approve Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is
hidden, only the `Refuse Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button is visible.

If the approval was a mistake, the request can be refused here, by
clicking the `Refuse
Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

Since the time off was approved in the time off window, click the
`X`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the top-right corner to close
the window. The conflict disappears from the
`Work Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, since it has
been resolved.

## Regenerate work entries {#payroll/regenerate-work-entries}

After conflicts are resolved, the affected work entries must be
regenerated. This recreates the specified work entries, and overwrites
the previously conflicting work entries.

While `conflicts <payroll/conflicts>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
*can* be resolved individually, if the conflicts are caused by another
application, such as **Planning** or **Attendances**, it is best
practice to correct the record in the application causing the conflict.
The reason this method is recommended is because, if the issue in the
related application is **not** resolved, when work entries are
regenerated, the conflicts reappear.

First, ensure the issues are resolved in the specific applications that
caused the work entry conflicts. Once the conflicts have been resolved
in the corresponding apps, open the work entry dashboard by navigating
to `Payroll app --> Work Entries --> Work Entries`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Click the `Regenerate Work Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button at the top of the `Work Entries`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard, and a
`Work Entry Regeneration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window appears.

Select the `Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to regenerate
work entries for, using the drop-down menu. Adjust the
`From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `To`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} fields, so the correct date range is displayed.

Click the `Regenerate Work Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button, and the work entries are recreated. Once finished, the pop-up
window closes.

![Regenerate a work entry for a particular employee.](work_entries/regenerate-details.png)

::: example
An employee has incorrect work entries generated from the **Planning**
app because they were incorrectly assigned to two work stations
simultaneously. This should be fixed in the **Planning** app, instead of
the **Payroll** app.

To correct this issue, modify the employee\'s schedule in the
**Planning** app, so they are correctly assigned to only one work
station. Then, in the **Payroll** app, regenerate work entries for that
employee, for that specific time period.

The **Payroll** app then pulls the new, corrected data form the
**Planning** app, and recreates the correct work entries for that
employee. All conflicts for that employee are now resolved.
:::

## Work entry types {#payroll/work-entry-types}

When `creating a work entry <payroll/new-work-entry>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} in the **Payroll** application, or when a new time off type
is created in the **Time Off** application, a work entry *type* needs to
be selected.

The **Payroll** app comes with nine preconfigured work entry types, and
depending on the installed
`payroll localization <payroll_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, additional country-specific work entries may be configured.
If there is a need for additional work entry types, they can be `created
<payroll/new-work-entry-type>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

To view the current work entry types available, navigate to
`Payroll app -->
Configuration --> Work Entries --> Work Entry Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Each work entry type has a code to aid in the creation of payslips, and
to ensure all taxes and fees are correctly entered.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Depending on the installed localization, other sections and fields may
appear on the form.
::::

![List of all work entry types currently available for use, with the payroll code and color.](work_entries/work-entry-types.png)

### New work entry type {#payroll/new-work-entry-type}

To create a new work entry type, go to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Work
Entries --> Work Entry Types`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
and click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, enter the
information for the following sections on the form.

#### General information section

- `Work Entry Type Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a
  name for the work entry type. It should be short and descriptive, such
  as [Sick Time]{.title-ref} or [Training]{.title-ref}.
- `Payroll Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a code for
  the work entry type. This code appears with the work entry type on
  timesheets and payslips. Since the code is used in conjunction with
  the **Accounting** application, it is advised to check with the
  accounting department for a code to use.
- `External Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a code to
  use for exporting data to a third-party payroll service. Check with
  the third-party being used to determine the
  `External Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to enter for the
  new work entry type.
- `Color`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select a color for the
  particular work entry type. This color appears on the work entry
  dashboard to aid in identifying work entry types.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The **only** required fields for a work entry type is the
`Work Entry Type Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
`Payroll Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

#### Display in payslip section

- `Rounding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select how the time
  entered for the work entry should be rounded. The rounding method
  selected determines how the worked time on timesheet entries are
  calculated. The options are:
  - `No Rounding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Work entries are
    not modified.
  - `Half Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Work entries are
    rounded to the closest half day amount.
  - `Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Work entries are rounded
    to the closest full day amount.
- `Rounding Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If either
  `Half Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected in the
  `Rounding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, this field
  appears. Select either `Up`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Down`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to determine how the
  rounding is handled.

::: example
The working time is set to an 8-hour work day (a 40-hour work week). An
employee enters a time of 5.5 hours on a work entry.

If the `Rounding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
`No Rounding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the work entry remains
at 5.5 hours.

If the `Rounding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
`Half Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Rounding Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
`Down`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the work entry is changed to
4 hours. If the `Rounding Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
set to `Up`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the work entry is
changed to 8 hours.

If the `Rounding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
`Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Rounding Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
`Down`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the work entry is changed to
zero hours. If the `Rounding Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
set to `Up`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the work entry is
changed to 8 hours.
:::

#### Unpaid section

- `Unpaid in Structures Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If
  the work entry type is for work that is *not paid*, specify which pay
  structure the unpaid work entry type applies to, using the drop-down

# Work entry analysis

The default *Work Entries Analysis* report provides an overview of the
validated work entries for the current month. To view this report,
navigate to `Payroll app --> Reporting -->
Work Entry Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

The work entries appear in a pivot table, with the default filters of
`Current month:
(Month)(Year)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Validated`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The various types of
`work_entries`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} populate the rows, while
the `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} values populate the only
visible column.

To change the displayed information, click
`fa-plus-square`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} above the main column,
revealing a drop-down menu of available metrics. Click on one of the
available groupings, and the data is further organized by that selected
metric. The default options are `Work
Entry Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If in a multi-company
database, a `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option also
appears.

## Work entry analysis comparison

It is possible to compare the work entries from one time period to a
previous time period. To view this comparison, first navigate to
`Payroll app --> Reporting --> Work Entry
Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Next, click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the search
bar, revealing a drop-down menu. Under the `fa-adjust`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Comparison`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
click on either `Current Month: Previous Period`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Current Month: Previous Year`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

The report updates and displays the data for the current time period,
data for the selected previous time period, as well as the
`Variation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} between the two, in a
percentage.

![A pivot table comparing the work entries of the current month and the previous month.](work_entry_analysis/work-entry-comparison.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If no work entries for a specific
`work entry type <payroll/work-entry-types>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are logged for the time period, it does **not** appear on
the report. That does **not** mean the work entry type does not exist,
or is not configured.

Additionally, if the default
`Current month: (Month)(Year)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter
is removed from the search bar, the `Comparison`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column does **not** appear; there must be a time-frame
selected to view the `Comparison`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column.
::::

## Use case: overtime report comparison

It is possible to alter the *Work Entries Analysis* report to show a
comparison of only overtime work entries, grouped by employee, for a
specific time period. To view this data, first navigate to the default
*Work entry analysis* report by going to `Payroll app --> Reporting -->
Work Entry Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Next, click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the search
bar, revealing a drop-down menu. Under the `fa-filter`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, click
`Add Custom
Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a
`Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears.

Using the drop-down menu, select `Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for the first field, leave the middle field as-is (with
`is in`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} populating the field), and
select `Overtime Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the last
field. Click `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and all other
work entry types disappear, and `Overtime Hours`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} appear in the sole row.

To compare overtime from the current month to the previous month, to see
which month had more overtime logged, click the
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon again in the
search bar. Under the `fa-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Comparison`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, click
`Current Month:
Previous Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click away from the
drop-down menu to close it.

Now, the report displays the `Overtime Hours`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for the current month and the previous month, along
with the `Variation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, in a
percentage.

To view which employees received the most overtime, click
`fa-plus-square`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Overtime
Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, revealing a drop-down menu of
options. Click `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and all
employees with overtime work entries for either the current or previous
month appears.

In this example, it can be determined that `Marc Demo`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} worked the most overtime in
`August 2024`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, whereas
`Beth Evans`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} worked the most overtime
hours in `September 2024`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Additionally, `Mitchell Admin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} had
the largest variation change, with a `-100%`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} change from `August 2024`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to `September 2024`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Working schedules

In Odoo, *working schedules* determine the hours employees are expected
to work, according to their `contract <contracts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, and informs the **Payroll** app how to compute work
entries, ultimately affecting salaries and payslips. It is necessary to
ensure all working schedules for employees are configured in the
database.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In Odoo\'s **Payroll** app, *working schedules* are referred to as
*working hours* in `salary
structures <payroll/structure-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

To view the currently configured working schedules, navigate to
`Payroll app -->
Configuration --> Working Schedules`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and the `Working Schedules`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard loads.

Working schedules are company-specific. In a multi-company database,
each company **must** identify each type of working schedule they use.
If the database is created for only one company, the
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column is not available.

::: example
An Odoo database containing multiple companies that use a standard
40-hour work week needs to have a separate working schedule entry for
each company that uses the 40-hour standard work week.

A database with five companies that all use a standard 40-hour work week
needs to have five separate 40-hour working schedules configured.
:::

![All working schedules available to use currently set up in the database for the company.](working_schedules/working-schedules.png)

## New working schedule {#payroll/new-working-schedule}

To create a new working schedule, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration -->
Working Schedules`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
`Working Schedules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form has two
sections, a general information section and a
`Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab listing out all
the individual working hours by day and time.

Fill out the following information on the top-half of the form:

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Type in the name for the
  new default working schedule. This should be descriptive and clear to
  understand, such as [Standard 20 Hours/Week]{.title-ref}.
- `Flexible Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick this
  checkbox if employees can work different hours from the working
  schedule.
- `Company Full Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  number of hours per week an employee would need to work to be
  considered a full-time employee. Typically, this is approximately 40
  hours, and this number affects what types of benefits an employee can
  receive, based on their employment status (full-time vs part-time).
- `Average Hour Per Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The average
  hours per day field is auto-populated, based on the working hours
  configured in the `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  tab. This entry affects resource planning, since the average daily
  hours affect what resources can be used, and in what quantity, per
  workday.
- `Work Time Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This percentage
  is auto-generated based on the entry for the
  `Company Full Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the working
  hours configured in the `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} tab. This number should be between
  [0.00%]{.title-ref} and [100%]{.title-ref}, so if the percentage is
  above [100%]{.title-ref}, it is an indication that the working times
  and/or `Company Full Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} hours
  need adjustment.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the company that
  can use these new default working hours from the drop-down menu. A
  blank field indicates it is available for all companies.
- `Timezone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the time zone to
  be used for the new default working hours from the drop-down menu.

Next, configure the individual hours in the
`Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. This tab lists
the specific working hours for each day.

The `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are
auto-populated for a default 40-hour work week, with each day divided
into three timed sections.

Every day has morning (8:00-12:00), lunch (12:00-13:00), and evening
(13:00-17:00) hours configured.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Work From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Work To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} times **must** be in a
24-hour format. For example, [2:00 PM]{.title-ref} is entered as
[14:00]{.title-ref}.
::::

Modify the `Day of Week`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Day Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} selections by
clicking on the drop-down menus in each column and making the desired
selection. The `Work From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Work To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns are modified by
typing in the time.

:::: important

:::

Keep in mind, working hours are company-specific, and **cannot** be
shared between companies. Each company needs to have its own working
hours set.

If the working hours are not consistent each week, and the hours are on
a bi-weekly schedule instead, click the
`Switch to 2 week calendar`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at
the top of the new default working hours form. This changes the
`Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to display two
weeks of working times that can be adjusted.

# Payroll

Odoo\'s **Payroll** app is used to calculate employees\' worked time in
conjunction with other Odoo apps, such as **Employees**, **Time Off**,
**Attendances**, and **Planning**, and create corresponding payslips.

When an employee is hired, they must sign a
`contract <payroll/contracts>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. The
contract outlines how the employee is compensated, including the salary
structure and rules their pay is calculated from, when they work (their
[working schedule]{.title-ref}), and what benefits they receive.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

It is critical to install the correct `country-specific localization
<payroll/payroll_localizations>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, as this
configures all local and national rules, regulations, and applicable
taxes for the selected country.
::::

In addition to the employee contract, any
`salary attachments <payroll/salary_attachments>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} must be configured before running payroll.

When it is time to run payroll according to the business\'s schedule
(monthly, weekly, bi-weekly, etc.),
`payslips <payroll/payslips>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} can be
created individually or in `groups
<payroll/pay_runs>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. Odoo calculates when
the employees worked based on their `work entries
<payroll/work_entries>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. Work entries are
created according to their `contracts
<payroll/contracts>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, based on information
from the **Attendances**, **Planning**, or **Timesheets** apps. Any
errors with work entries **must** be resolved *before* continuing to
process payroll.

After all issues or conflicts are resolved, payslips are
`processed <payroll/process>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and then
`employees are paid <payroll/pay-employee>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, either with a wire transfer or a physical check.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It is possible to pay employees with cash, but this is not recommended.
::::

## Settings

Before running payroll, various settings for the **Payroll** app
**must** be configured. Navigate to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. The various settings for
`accounting <payroll-accounting>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`localizations <payroll-localizations>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`time off
<payroll-time-off>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
`general payroll settings <payroll-payroll-settings>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are specified here.

### Accounting {#payroll-accounting}

Configure the following in the accounting section of the configuration
menu:

- `Payroll Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enable this
  option to post payroll slips in the **Accounting** app, in a
  [Salaries]{.title-ref} box on the main dashboard.
- `Payroll SEPA`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enable this option
  to create `SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} payments.
- `Batch Account Move Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enable
  this option to have a single account move line created from all the
  accounting entries of the same period. This anonymizes accounting
  entries and disables the creation of individual payments.

### Localizations {#payroll-localizations}

*Localizations* are country-specific settings preconfigured in Odoo at
the creation of the database, which account for all taxes, fees, and
allowances for that particular country.

The `Localization`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
**Payroll** app `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page
includes specific settings that need to be configured for the specific
country.

The settings and options shown in this section vary, depending on the
`localization enabled
<payroll/payroll_localizations>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} for the
database.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

It is **not** recommended to alter the localization settings, unless
specifically required due to special circumstances. For example, a new
law is passed that changes basic salary rules, or a company is exempt
from specific taxes.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Odoo can handle multi-company configurations. This is generally done
when there is a main company or office location, such as a headquarters,
with other offices or branches located either in the country or
internationally, that fall under that main company or headquarters. In
Odoo, each company, including the headquarters, **must** be set up as
its own company or branch using the multi-company method.

Each company can have a different localization setting, since locations
can vary worldwide, where rules and laws differ.

For more information on companies, refer to the
`companies <../general/companies>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation, or the
`multi-company <../general/companies/multi_company>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation, which covers how to set up multiple
companies.
::::

::: seealso
`payroll/payroll_localizations`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

### Time off {#payroll-time-off}

`Deferred Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If time off is
taken *after* payslips are validated, the time off must be applied to
the following pay period to avoid cancelling then reprocessing payslips.
Select the person responsible for these specific time off situations
using the drop-down menu in the `Responsible`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

::: example
An employee is paid on the 15th of the month and the last day of the
month. Payslips are typically processed one day before.

An employee\'s payslip is approved and processed on the 30th, but that
same employee took an unexpected sick day on the 31st.

Since the employee was already paid for a regular workday on the 31st,
to keep the time off balances correct, the sick day is applied to the
1st of the next month (during the next pay period).
:::

### Payroll {#payroll-payroll-settings}

The payroll section allows for the installation of a
`payroll localization
<payroll/payroll_localizations>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. Click
`oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Choose a Payroll
Localization`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a Kanban view of
all available payroll localizations loads. Click
`Install`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the desired localization
to install it. If a localization has been installed, only a
`Module Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button appears for that
specific localization.

Once a localization has been installed, configure the following fields:

- `Contract Expiration Notice Period`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: Enter the number of `Days`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} before a contract expires, when Odoo notifies the
  responsible person about the upcoming expiration.
- `Payslip PDF Display`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enable this
  option to show the payslip\'s PDF when the state is validated.
- `Work Permit Expiration Notice Period`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: Enter the number of `Days`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} before a work permit expires, when Odoo notifies the
  responsible person about the upcoming expiration.
- `YTD Reset Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the date
  when the `YTD (Year To Date)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is reset
  to. By default, this field is set to January 1st.

# Add new applicants

Once an applicant submits an application, either using the online
application, or emailing a job position alias, an applicant card is
automatically created in the **Recruitment** application.

However, in some instances, applicants may need to be created manually
in the database. This could be necessary if, for example, a company
accepts paper applications in the mail, or is meeting prospective
applicants at an in-person job fair.

To view current applicants, navigate to the
`Recruitment`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, then click
the desired job position card. Doing so reveals the
`Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, which displays
all applicants for that specific role, in a default Kanban view,
organized by stage.

Add new applicants from a job position\'s
`Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page by using either:
the `quick add <recruitment/quick-add-applicant>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} button, or the `New
<recruitment/create-new-applicant>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
button.

## Quick add {#recruitment/quick-add-applicant}

On the `Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, click the
quick add button, represented by a small `fa-plus`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(plus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
top-right corner of each stage, to add a new applicant to that stage.

Enter the following information on the card:

- `Candidate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the applicant
  from the drop-down menu. Displays as the card title in the Kanban view
  of the `Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page. If the
  candidate is *not* in the system (from a previous application, or is a
  current employee), after entering the applicant\'s name, click
  `Create "(candidate)"`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The current job
  position populates this field. If needed, the job position can be
  changed by selecting a different position from the drop-down menu. If
  a different job position is selected, after the card is created, the
  card appears on the `Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  page for that newly-selected job position.

After the information is entered, click `Add`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The applicant appears in the list, and a new blank
applicant card appears.

If preferred, after entering the `Candidate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the Kanban card that appears, click
`Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a detailed applicant form
loads. Refer to the `New applicant form
<recruitment/applicant-details>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} section
for details about filling out the form.

When doing a quick add, clicking away from an empty card, or clicking
the `fa-trash-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
(`trash`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) icon, discards the
applicant.

![All the fields for a new applicant form entered when using the Quick Add option.](add-new-applicants/quick-add.png)

## New applicant form {#recruitment/create-new-applicant}

On the `Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the top-left corner,
and a blank application form loads.

On the new application form, the `Job Position`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Recruiter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
fields are populated according to the job position configurations, by
default. Additionally, the `Department`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields
in the `Details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab may also be
populated, if those details are configured on the job position.

Complete the fields in the following sections on the new applicant form.

# Applicant analysis

The *Applicant Analysis* report allows recruiting departments to see
which job positions have the most applicants, which have the most
referrals, and how long it takes for applicants to move through the
pipeline.

Knowing how many applicants each specific job position has, along with
statistics about how many are hired and refused, can provide valuable
insights. This information can assist the recruiting team to pivot their
strategies to acquire the most desirable candidates.

## Applicant analysis report

Start by navigating to
`Recruitment app --> Reporting --> Applicant Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. This presents a line chart of all applicants for
the last year.

Three separate color-coded metrics are presented:
`In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Hired`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Refused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Hover the cursor over a month of the chart, and a pop-up window appears,
displaying the specific numbers for that month.

![The default Applicant Analysis report.](applicant_analysis/line-chart.png)

### Pivot table view

For a more detailed view of the information in the
`Applicant Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report, click
the `oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the top-right
corner. This displays all the information in a pivot table.

In this view, the job positions are displayed in the rows, and the
columns display the total numbers of applicants, including how many of
those applicants were hired or refused, and who is still in the
recruitment process. The displayed information can be modified, if
desired.

In this example, there are 18 total applicants. Out of that, six have
been hired, two have been refused, and ten are still in the recruitment
pipeline. The `Experienced Developer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
position has six total applicants, three of which were hired, one
refused, and two still in progress.

![The detailed pivot table view.](applicant_analysis/pivot-view.png)

#### Use case: applicants with referrals

To get a better understanding of how effective the company\'s
`referral program <../referrals>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} is, the
`Applicant Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report can be
modified to show how many applicants were referred by current employees.

From the `oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view of the
`Applicant Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report, first
click the `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to reveal
a drop-down menu of options.

Click both `Has Referrer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, to activate those two
measures. Then, click `Applicant`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Hired`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Refused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to deactivate those default
measures.

Now, the column displays the number of applicants that came from a
referral in the `Has
Referrer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, and the total
number of applicants in the `Count`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column.

![The detailed pivot table view displaying the number of referrals and the total applicants.](applicant_analysis/referral.png)

In this example, the `Experienced Developer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Interior Designer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} job positions both have applicants from referrals,
while the rest do not have any referrals.

##### Hired through referrals

It is possible to modify this report even further to see how many
referred applicants end up being hired.

To view this data, click on a `fa-plus-square`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `[job position]`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} row,
which reveals a drop-down menu. Then, click `State`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to show the various states applicants are currently in.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Only states that have applicants in them are shown for each job
position. If a state does **not** have any applicants, it does not
appear in the list.
::::

To expand the other rows, and display the various states, click on the
`fa-plus-square`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`[job position]`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![The detailed pivot table view displaying applicants hired through referrals.](applicant_analysis/state.png)

Both the `Experienced Developer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Interior Designer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} roles yielded one
referral hire each, confirming that developers and designers generate
the highest-success referrals.

### Create interview form {#recruitment/interview}

An *Interview Form* is used to determine if a candidate is a good fit
for a job position. Interview forms can be as specific or general as
desired, and can take the form of a certification, an exam, or a general
questionnaire. Interview forms are determined by the recruitment team.

Before creating an interview form, ensure the proper settings are
enabled. Navigate to
`Recruitment app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and under the
`Recruitment Process`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, ensure
the `Send Interview Survey`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is
enabled.

Since there are no preconfigured forms in Odoo, all interview forms must
be created. To create an interview form, start from the
`Recruitment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
`Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form. In the
`Interview Form`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, enter a name
for the new interview form. As the name is typed, several options
populate beneath the entry:
`Create (interview form name)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Search More...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click
`Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a
`Create Interview Form`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears.

![The blank interview form pop-up window.](new_job/blank-interview-form.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The option `Search More...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} only
appears if there are any interview forms already created. If no
interview forms exist, the only options available are `Create (interview
form name)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

Proceed to fill out the interview form pop-up window as a typical
survey. For specific directions on how to create a survey, refer to the
`survey essentials <../../marketing/surveys/create>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} document, which provides step-by-step instructions on how to
create and configure a survey.

### Job board settings

To publish a job listing onto a job board outside of Odoo, first a
setting must be configured in the **Recruitment** app. Navigate to
`Recruitment app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Choose a Job Board`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

This loads a page displaying the
`Recruitment Integration Monster`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
module. Click `Activate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to install
the module.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the `Recruitment Integration Monster`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} module is already installed, no
`Activate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button appears, only a
`Module Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.
::::

After the module is installed, the database reloads to the main
dashboard. Open the **Recruitment** app, and navigate to
`Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. A
`Monster Credentials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section appears
in the `Job Posting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

Enter the `Username`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Password`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for Monster in the
corresponding fields, then click the `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

### Publish on job board

Once the credentials have been configured for the job board, it is
possible to post a job position. Navigate to the **Recruitment** app
dashboard, and click `# To Recruit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
on the desired job card.

Click the `Publish on Job Board`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button, and a `Publish on Job Board`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
form loads in a pop-up window. Fill out the following information on the
form:

- `Job`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The name of the job position
  appears here by default, and cannot be modified.

- `Job Board`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the job board being posted to.

- `Apply Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Click the desired
  radio button to determine how applicants apply for the position.

  - `Send an Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this for
    applicants to apply for the job via email.
  - `Redirect to company's website`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    Select this for applicants to apply for the job via the company
    website.

- `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Job url`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The selected
  `Apply Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} determines which
  field appears. The field is populated with the information from the
  job card, if available. Make any desired modifications to this field,
  for example enter a tracking url for the job board listing.

- `From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `to`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: Using the calendar selector, select the date the
  list should be posted to the job board, in the
  `From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. The
  `to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field says
  `No Limit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, by default. If the job
  position should be removed from the job board on a specific date,
  enter it in the second field.

- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab: The description
  from the job card populates this tab, by default. Make any desired
  changes to it in this section. This is what appears on the job board.

  :::: tip
  ::: title
  Tip
  :::

  Click the `Generate Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  (`fa-magic`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `AI`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}) to use AI to edit or create the job description.
  ::::

Once the listing is ready, click the `Post`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. After the post has been published to a job
board, the page reloads to the `Job Boards Posts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, and the new post appears in a Kanban card.

#### Job board emails

When posting job positions on a job board, like Indeed or LinkedIn, the
job board posts the job position, and typically allows the website
visitor to apply to the job directly from the job board.

When someone applies to a job directly from a job board, an email is
sent to Odoo from a specific email address, such as
[jobs-listings@linkedin.com]{.title-ref}. The email uses regular
expression (regex) rules, which are instructions to match text in the
email, and map it to specific fields in Odoo.

When Odoo receives an email from the job board\'s corresponding email
address, it runs the regex rule, and pulls applicant information from
the email, when creating an applicant record.

::: example
The regex rule for `LinkedIn`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (emails
received from: [jobs-listings@linkedin.com]{.title-ref}) is
`New application:.*from (.*)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This
rule tells Odoo to capture everything after the word [from]{.title-ref}
when creating the applicant record.

An email subject of [New application: Job ID 123 from John
Doe]{.title-ref} will capture [John Doe]{.title-ref} and create an
applicant record for [John Doe]{.title-ref}.
:::

To view the currently configured job board emails, navigate to
`Recruitment app -->
Configuration --> Emails`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Three
emails come preconfigured in the database; for
`LinkedIn`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Jobsdb`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Indeed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

##### Create job board emails

To create a new job board email, navigate to
`Recruitment app --> Configuration -->
Emails`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and a blank
`Emails`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form loads.

Enter the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the platform,
such as [Glassdoor]{.title-ref}, in the corresponding field. Next, enter
the email address the applications will come from, in the
`Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Last, enter the
`regex`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} rules in the corresponding
field.

### View job board listings

To view all the job positions that have been posted to a job board,
navigate to
`Recruitment --> Applications --> Job Boards Posts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. This presents the `Job
Boards Posts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard and all job
board postings.

Each listing is displayed in an individual Kanban card, with the
following information:

- `Job Board Icon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the icon for the
  job board where the listing is posted.
- `Job Board Listing Title`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the job
  position title and job board name.
- `From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date the listing was
  published.
- `To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date the listing will be
  removed from the job board.
- `User Icon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the icon of the user
  who posted the listing.

Click on any Kanban card to view the details for the specific job board
listing.

# Recruitment flow

When a prospective employee applies for a job in Odoo, there is a
preconfigured process from the
`initial inquiry <recruitment/new>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to the
`creating of a new employee
<recruitment/new-employee>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} once hired.
The following outlines the default recruitment process for Odoo\'s
**Recruitment** application.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The following is based on Odoo\'s default recruitment pipeline. Be
advised that if
`modifications are made <recruitment/customize-stages>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to the pipeline, the process differs.
::::

## New {#recruitment/new}

At the start of the process, all applicants appear in the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage on the
`Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, whether
submitted online or if the applicant is `manually
entered by a recruiter <add-new-applicants>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

The `Candidate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} number on the applicant\'s
card are filled as soon as it is created. By default, these details are
required for every job position.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the website application form is modified, different fields may be
populated, based on what information is required on the website.
::::

Anything typed in the *Short Introduction* section appears in the
applicant\'s chatter as an `Other Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} note from `OdooBot`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Resumé

If a resumé was attached to the online application, it appears in the
`Files`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the chatter, and
is also stored in the **Documents** application.

To find the recruitment documents, navigate to the main
`Documents app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} dashboard, and
click the `Recruitment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} folder on the
left-hand side. All recruitment documents are stored within that folder.

If the `CV Display <recruitment/cv-display>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} option was enabled in the `Settings
<recruitment/settings>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} of the
**Recruitment** app, the resumé appears on the applicant\'s card.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Depending on the browser zoom level, or size of the browser screen, the
resumé may appear below the main applicant card information as a PDF
link, or on the right side as an image.
::::

### Send interview

At any point in the hiring process, an interview can be sent to the
applicant to obtain more information. These interviews are custom-made,
and can be formatted in a variety of ways.

The **Surveys** application is required to send interviews to an
applicant, so it **must** be installed.

Odoo uses the term *interview*, but these can be thought of as
questionnaires, surveys, tests, certifications, etc. Custom interviews
can be formatted to suit each individual job position\'s needs. For more
information on creating and editing interviews, refer to the
`../../hr/recruitment/new_job`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation.

::: example
A job position for a computer programmer could have an interview in the
form of a programming quiz to determine the skill level of the
applicant. A job position for a restaurant server could have a
questionnaire inquiring about the applicant\'s availability, if the
desired applicant needs to be available on weekend evenings.
:::

To send an interview to an applicant, first click the applicant\'s card
from the `Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, to view
the detailed applicant information. At the top-left of the applicant\'s
card, click the `Send Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button.

If the applicant\'s card has an email address on file, a
`Send an interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears, with the `Recipients`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Subject`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and email body populated.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To send an email to an applicant, there **must** be an
`Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} address on the applicant\'s
card.

If an email address is not entered on the applicant\'s card, when the
`Send Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is clicked,
an `Edit: (Applicant's Name)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window appears, *on top of* the `Send an interview`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

Enter the email address in the `Email`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, then click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Once the applicant\'s information is saved, the
`Edit: (Applicant's Name)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window closes, and the `Send an interview`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window remains.
::::

Sometimes, preconfigured email templates in Odoo use dynamic
placeholders, which are automatically filled with specific data when the
email is sent. For example, if a placeholder for the applicant\'s name
is used, it is replaced with the actual name of the applicant in the
email. For more detailed information on email templates, refer to the
`../../general/companies/email_template`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation.

Add the email addresses of any additional recipients for the survey in
the `Additional
emails`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, if more people should
receive the email. If an email address is in the database as a contact,
add that contact in the `Recipients`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. If an email should be sent to someone who is not in the database
as a contact, and they should **not** be added as a contact, add their
email address in the `Additional emails`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

If any attachments need to be added, click the
`fa-paperclip`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Attachments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and a file
explorer window appears. Navigate to the desired file, and click
`Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to attach it to the email. The
attachment loads, and is listed above the
`fa-paperclip`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Attachments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

If the emailed interview must be completed by a specific date, enter
that date in the `Answer deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, located in the lower-right area of the pop-up window.

To do so, click the empty field next to
`Answer deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a calendar
selector appears. Use the `fa-chevron-left`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(left)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`fa-chevron-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(right)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} arrows, on either side of
the month, to navigate to the desired month. Then, click on the desired
day to select the date. Next, select the time the interview is due, in
the two fields at the bottom of the calendar selector.

The `Mail Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
pre-populated, based on the configuration for the interview. A different
template can be chosen from the drop-down menu, if desired. If a new
template is selected, the new email template loads in the email body.

To send the email with the interview link to the applicant, click
`Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the bottom of the email
pop-up window.

![Send a custom survey, also referred to as an interview form, to an applicant using a
preconfigured template.](recruitment-flow/send-survey.png)

## Initial qualification {#recruitment/initial-qualification}

If an applicant seems to be a good potential candidate, they are moved
to the `Initial
Qualification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage.

This stage exists to sort candidates that have potential, from those
that do not meet the requirements. No automatic actions, such as emails,
are set for this stage. This stage informs the recruitment team to
potentially set up a phone call or an interview with the candidate.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In order to move an applicant\'s card from one stage to another, the
applicant\'s card can either be dragged and dropped in the Kanban view
of the `Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page to the
desired stage, or the stage can be modified on the applicant\'s card.

To change the stage on the applicant\'s card, first click the desired
applicant\'s card from the `Applications`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page. The current stage for the card is highlighted at
the top on a status bar, above the card.

Click the desired stage for the card, and the stage changes. A log note
indicating the stage change appears in the chatter, as well.

![Change the stage of an applicant by clicking on the desired stage at the top of the
applicant\'s card.](recruitment-flow/stage-change.png)
::::

## First interview {#recruitment/first-interview}

After an applicant has passed the
`Initial Qualification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage, they
can be manually moved to the `First Interview`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} stage on the `Applications`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, while in Kanban view.

To move the applicant to the next stage, drag-and-drop the applicant\'s
card to the `First
Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage.

Alternatively, open the desired applicant\'s card from the
`Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, and click the
`First Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage on the status
bar at the top of the individual applicant\'s card.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The `First Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage can be
modified, so when the applicant\'s card moves to the
`First Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage, an email can
be automatically sent to the applicant, stating an interview is
requested. In this preconfigured email template, a link to the
recruiting team\'s calendar appears, allowing the applicant to schedule
their interview.

`Edit <recruitment/edit-stage>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
`First Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage, and select
the `Recruitment: Schedule Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option in the `Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
to automate this action.
::::

## Second interview {#recruitment/second-interview}

After an applicant has passed the `First Interview`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} stage, they can be moved to the
`Second Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage. To move the
applicant to the next stage, drag-and-drop the applicant\'s card to the
`Second Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage from the
Kanban view of the `Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
page, or click on the `Second Interview`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} stage at the top of the individual applicant\'s card.

When the applicant\'s card moves to the
`Second Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage, there are
no automatic activities or emails configured for this stage, by default.
The recruiter can now `schedule a
second interview <recruitment/schedule_interviews/recruitment-scheduled>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} with the applicant, following the same process as the first
interview.

## Contract Proposal {#recruitment/contract-proposal}

After the applicant has completed the various interview processes, the
next step is to `send
the job offer <offer_job_positions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

Once the offer has been sent, drag-and-drop the applicant\'s card to the
`Contract
Proposal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage from the Kanban view
of the `Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, or click
on the `Contract Proposal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage at
the top of the individual applicant\'s card.

## Contract Signed

Once the contract has been signed, and the applicant has been hired, the
applicant\'s card moves to the `Contract Signed`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} stage.

Drag-and-drop the applicant\'s card to the
`Contract Signed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage from the
Kanban view of the `Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
page, or click the `fa-ellipsis-h`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(ellipsis)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon at the top of the
individual applicant\'s card, then click
`Contract Signed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the status bar.

## Refuse applicant

At any point in the recruitment process, a candidate can be
`refused <refuse_applicant>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.




--- SOURCE: hr/recruitment/refuse_applicant.md ---

# Refuse applicants

At any point in the recruitment process, an applicant can be refused for
a job position.

To refuse an applicant, start by navigating to the applicant\'s card in
the **Recruitment** app. This is done in one of two ways:

- Navigate to
  `Recruitment app --> Applications --> All Applications`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}. In the `Applications`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} list, click anywhere on the desired applicant\'s line
  to open that specific applicant\'s card.
- Navigate to the main *Job Positions* dashboard by navigating to
  `Recruitment app
  --> Applications --> By Job Position`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}. Next, click on the desired job position card,
  then click on the individual applicant card from the
  `Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.

At the top of the applicant\'s card, there are several buttons. Click
the one labeled `Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Refuse reasons {#recruitment/refuse-reasons}

*Refuse reasons* allow recruiters to document why an applicant was not a
good fit, and send specific refusal reason email templates to the
applicant.

Clicking `Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on an applicant\'s
form makes the `Refuse Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window appear.

The default refuse reasons in Odoo, and their corresponding email
templates, are:

+---------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Email Template                                          | Refusal Reason                                          |
+=========================================================+=========================================================+
| `Recruitment: Refuse`{.interpreted-text                 | | `Does not fit the job requirements`{.interpreted-text |

|                                                         | | `Refused by applicant: salary`{.interpreted-text      |
|                                                         |   role="guilabel"}                                      |
+---------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

Additional refusal reasons
`can be created, and existing ones can be modified (or deleted)
<recruitment/new-refuse>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Select a refusal reason to
`send a refusal email <recruitment/send-refusal-email>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### Create or modify refuse reasons {#recruitment/new-refuse}

To view and configure refuse reasons, navigate to
`Recruitment app --> Configuration
--> Refuse Reasons`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Doing so
reveals the `Refuse Reasons`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page,
where all the existing refusal reasons are listed.

To create a new refuse reason from the
`Refuse Reasons`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the top-left corner.
A blank line appears at the bottom of the list, with an empty field
present in the `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

Type in the new refuse reason in the field. It is recommended to enter a
reason that is short and concise, such as [Offer expired]{.title-ref} or
[Withdrew application]{.title-ref}.

Then, in the `Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
click on the field to reveal a drop-down menu. Select an
`Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the list to be
used when this refuse reason is selected.

If a new `Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is desired,
type in the name for the new template in the field. Then, click
`Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a
`Create Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form pop-up
window appears.

In the `Create Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window, enter a `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the form,
and an email `Subject`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
corresponding fields.

Enter the desired email content in the `Content`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. Proceed to make any other modifications to the
template in the `Email Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tabs, then click
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the template.
Upon clicking that, Odoo returns to the
`Refuse Reasons`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list.

The new template appears in the new refuse reason
`Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Pre-configured recruitment refusal email templates in Odoo use dynamic
placeholders, which are personalized placeholders that populate data
from the applicant\'s record in the email body.

For example, if the applicant\'s name is a used in a dynamic
placeholder, the applicant\'s name appears anytime that dynamic
placeholder appears on the email template.

For more detailed information on email templates, refer to the
`../../general/companies/email_template`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation.
::::

## Send refusal email {#recruitment/send-refusal-email}

After clicking the `Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on
an applicant form, a `Refuse Reason
<recruitment/refuse-reasons>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is then
selected from the `Refuse Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pop-up window. Then, two fields appear below the selected refusal
reason: `Send Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The Refuse Reason pop-up window that appears when refusing an applicant.](refuse_applicant/refuse-pop-up.png)

The applicant\'s email address automatically populates the
`Send Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field; additional email
recipients **cannot** be added.

If an email should **not** be sent to the applicant, uncheck the
`Send Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

The email template associated with the refusal reason populates the
`Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. If a
different email template is desired, select a different template from
the `Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu.

To send the refusal email to the applicant, ensure the
`Send Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox is ticked, then
click `Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the bottom of the
`Refuse Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window. The
refusal email is sent to the applicant, and a red
`Refused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner appears on the
applicant\'s card in the top-right corner.

![An applicant\'s card with the refused banner appearing in the top-right corner in red.](refuse_applicant/refuse.png)

## View refused applicants

After refusal, the applicant\'s card is no longer visible in the job
position\'s Kanban view. However, it is still possible to view
applicants who have been refused.

To view only the refused applicants, go to
`Recruitment app --> Applications --> By
Job Positions`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, or
`Recruitment app --> Applications --> All Applications`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Both methods navigate to the
`Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, the only
difference is `By Job
Positions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} displays applicants in a
Kanban view, while `All Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
displays applicants in a list view.

On the `Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, click the

then click `Refused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, located under
the `fa-funnel`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

All applicants that have been refused for the job position appear on the
`Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page for that
position, organized by the stage they were in when they were refused.

# Schedule interviews

An in-person, virtual, or phone interview can be scheduled in one of two
ways through the **Recruitment** app, either by the `recruitment team
<recruitment/schedule_interviews/recruitment-scheduled>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, or by the `applicant
<recruitment/schedule_interviews/applicant-scheduled>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

With one drag-and-drop, Odoo emails the candidate with a self-service
link, the candidate books the time slot, and sends the meeting to
everyone\'s calendar. No more back-and-forth emails or calls.

## Recruitment team scheduled interviews {#recruitment/schedule_interviews/recruitment-scheduled}

When an applicant reaches the interview stage, the recruitment team
should schedule the interview, by first coordinating a suitable date and
time with the applicant and interviewers.

To schedule the interview, navigate to the applicant\'s card, by first
going to the `Recruitment app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and clicking the relevant job card. This opens the
`Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page for that job
position. Then, click the desired applicant\'s card to view their
detailed applicant form.

To schedule an phone, virtual, or in-person interview, click the
`fa-calendar`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `No
Meeting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the top of
the applicant\'s record.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Meetings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button displays
`fa-calendar`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`No Meeting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if no meetings are
currently scheduled. For applicants who are new to the
`First Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage, this is the
default.

If there is one meeting already scheduled, the smart button displays
`1 Meeting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, with the date of the
upcoming meeting beneath it. If more than one meeting is scheduled, the
button displays `Next Meeting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, with
the date of the first upcoming meeting beneath it.
::::

Clicking the `Meetings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button
loads a calendar, showing the scheduled meetings and events for the
currently signed-in user, as well as the employees who are listed under
the `Attendees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, located to
the right of the calendar.

To change the currently loaded meetings and events being displayed,
uncheck an attendee whose calendar events are to be hidden. Only the
checked attendees are visible on the calendar.

![The calendar view, highlighting how to change the displayed meetings.](schedule_interviews/calendar.png)

To add a meeting to the calendar when in the *Day* or *Week* view, click
on the start time of the meeting and drag down to the end time. Doing so
selects the date, time, and the length of the meeting.

A meeting can also be added in this view by clicking on the desired day
*and* time slot.

Both methods cause a
`New Event <recruitment/schedule_interviews/event-card>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} pop-up window to appear.

### New event pop-up window {#recruitment/schedule_interviews/event-card}

Clicking a grid, corresponding with the time and date, opens the
`New Event`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window to schedule
a meeting.

Enter the information on the form. The only required fields to enter are
a title for the meeting, along with the `Start`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} (and end date/time) fields.

Once the card details are entered, click
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the changes
and create the interview.

After entering in a required name for the meeting, the fields available
to modify on the `New Event`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} card are
as follows:

- `Meeting Title`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the subject
  for the meeting. This should clearly indicate the purpose of the
  meeting. The default subject is the `Candidate`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} name entered on the applicant\'s card.

- `Start`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Configure the start and
  end date and times for the meeting. Clicking either of these fields
  opens a calendar pop-up window. Click on the desired date to select
  it, and then enter the time in the corresponding field. Click
  `fa-check`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Apply`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to close the window.

- `All Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick the box to schedule
  an all-day interview. If this box is ticked, the
  `Start`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field changes to
  `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Attendees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the people who
  should attend the meeting. The default attendees are the prospective
  candidate, and the assigned recruiter for the job position. Add as
  many other people as desired.

- `Videocall URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the meeting is
  virtual, or if there is a virtual option available, click
  `fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Odoo meeting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a URL is
  automatically created for the meeting, which populates the field.

- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a brief
  description in this field. There is an option to enter formatted text,
  such as numbered lists, headings, tables, links, photos, and more. Use
  the powerbox feature, by typing a [/]{.title-ref} to reveal a list of
  options.

  Scroll through the options and click on the desired item. The item
  appears in the field, and can be modified. Each command presents a
  different pop-up window. Follow the instructions for each command to
  complete the entry.

#### More options

To add additional information to the meeting, click the
`More Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
lower-right corner of the
`New Event <recruitment/schedule_interviews/event-card>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} pop-up window. Enter any of the following additional fields:

- `Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field auto
  populates based on the `Start`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (and
  end) date and time. If the meeting time is adjusted, this field
  automatically adjusts to the correct duration length. The default
  length of a meeting is one hour.
- `Recurrent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the meeting should
  repeat at a selected interval (not typical for a first interview),
  tick the checkbox next to `Recurrent`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. Several additional fields appear when this is
  enabled:
  - `Timezone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: using the drop-down
    menu, select the `Timezone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
    the recurrent meetings.
  - `Repeat`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: choose
    `Daily`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Weekly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Yearly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
    `Custom`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} recurring meetings. If
    `Custom`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, a
    `Repeat Every`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears
    beneath it, along with another time frequency parameter
    (`Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Weeks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
    `Years`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}). Enter a number in the
    blank field, then select the time period using the drop-down menu.
  - `Repeat on`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enabled when the
    `Weekly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is selected in
    the `Repeat`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Choose the
    day the weekly meeting falls on.
  - `Day of Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: configure the two
    drop-down menu options to select a specific day of the month,
    irrespective of the date (e.g. the first Tuesday of every month). To
    set a specific calendar date, choose
    `Date of Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and enter the
    calendar date in the field (e.g. [15]{.title-ref} to set the meeting
    to occur on the fifteenth of every month).
  - `Until`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: using the drop-down
    menu, select when the meetings stop repeating. The available options
    are `Number of repetitions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `End date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
    `Forever`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If
    `Number of repetitions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
    selected, enter the number of total meetings to occur in the blank
    field to the right. If `End date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    is selected, specify the date using the calendar pop-up window, or
    type in a date in a MM/DD/YYYY format. `Forever`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} schedules meetings indefinitely.
- `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the location for
  the meeting.
- `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select any tags for the
  meeting using the drop-down menu, or add a new tag by typing in the
  tag and clicking `Create "tag"`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  There is no limit to the number of tags that can be used.
- `Privacy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select if the organizer
  appears either `Available`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Busy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the duration of the
  meeting. Next, select the visibility of this meeting, using the
  drop-down menu to the right of the first selection. Options are
  `Public`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Private`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Only internal users`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  `Public`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} allows for everyone to see
  the meeting, `Private`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} allows only
  the attendees listed on the meeting to see the meeting, and
  `Only internal users`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} allows anyone
  logged into the company database to see the meeting.
- `Organizer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the employee who
  created the meeting is populated in this field. Use the drop-down menu
  to change the selected employee.
- `Reminders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select a reminder from
  the drop-down menu. Default options include
  `Notification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `SMS Text Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, each with a
  specific time period before the event (hours, days, etc). The chosen
  reminder chosen alerts the meeting participants of the meeting, via
  the selected option at the specified time. Multiple reminders can be
  selected in this field.

![A new meeting card with all the details populated, and ready to save.](schedule_interviews/new-event.png)

### Send meeting to attendees

Once changes have been entered on the
`New Event <recruitment/schedule_interviews/event-card>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} pop-up window, and the meeting details are correct, the
meeting can be sent to the attendees, via email or text message, from
the expanded event form (what is seen when the
`More Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is clicked on
in the `New Event`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window).

To send the meeting via email, click the `fa-envelope`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `EMAIL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to
the `Attendees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the expanded
meeting form.

A `Contact Attendees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} email
configurator pop-up window appears. A pre-formatted email, using the
default `Calendar: Event Update`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
email template, populates the email body field.

The applicant, followers of the job application, as well as the user who
created the meeting, are added to the `To`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} by default. Make any desired changes to the email.

![Enter the information to send the event via email.](schedule_interviews/email-event.png)

To send the meeting via text message, click the
`fa-mobile`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `SMS`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button next to the `Attendees`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field on the expanded meeting form. A
`Send SMS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears.

At the top, a blue banner appears if any attendees do not have valid
mobile numbers, and lists how many records are invalid. If a contact
does not have a valid mobile number listed, click
`Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and edit the attendee\'s
record, then redo these steps.

When no warning message appears, type in the message to be sent to the
attendees in the `Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. To
add any emojis to the message, click the
`oi-smile-add`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(smile add)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon on the right-side
of the pop-up window.

The number of characters, and amount of text messages required to send
the message (according to GSM7 criteria) appears beneath the
`Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Click
`Put in queue`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to have the text sent
later, after any other messages are scheduled, or click
`Send Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to send the message
immediately.

![Send a text message to the attendees of the meeting.](schedule_interviews/send-sms.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Sending text messages is **not** a default capability with Odoo. To send
text messages, credits are required, which need to be purchased. For
more information on IAP credits and plans, refer to the
`../../essentials/in_app_purchase`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation.
::::

## Applicant scheduled interviews {#recruitment/schedule_interviews/applicant-scheduled}

Coordinating interview times typically requires several email exchanges
and can slow the recruitment process. Enabling Odoo\'s self-service
scheduling removes that bottleneck: when an applicant is moved to an
interview stage, the system automatically sends a scheduling link,
records the selected slot, and updates all relevant calendars.

This automation is turned off by default. To activate it, assign the
`Recruitment:
Schedule Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} email template to
either the `First Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Second
Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage (see
`recruitment/schedule_interviews/modify-stage`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}).

### Modify stage {#recruitment/schedule_interviews/modify-stage}

`Modify <recruitment/modify-stages>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
either the `First Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Second Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage so the
stage\'s `Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
set to `Recruitment: Schedule interview`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![The Recruitment: Schedule Interview email template populating the Email Template field.](schedule_interviews/interview-template.png)

### Send email

After configuring the `First Interview`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Second Interview`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} stages to
`send emails <recruitment/schedule_interviews/modify-stage>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, drag-and-drop the applicant card into one of these stages
to send the email.

### Self-scheduled interview

When the applicant received the email, they click the
`Schedule my interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the
bottom of the email. This navigates the applicant to a private online
scheduling page, which is **only** accessible through the emailed link.

This page displays the `MEETING DETAILS`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the right side of the screen. This includes the
format and length of the meeting. In this example. the interview is
virtual (`fa-video-camera`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Online`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) and the duration is a half
hour (`fa-clock-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`30 minutes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

Then the applicant clicks on an available day on the calendar, signified
by purple text. Once a day is selected, they click on one of the
available times to select that date and time.

![The calendar screen with dates and times to schedule an interview.](schedule_interviews/select-date-time.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Be sure to check the `Timezone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, beneath the calendar, to ensure it is set to the correct time
zone. Changing the time zone may alter the available times presented.
::::

Once the date and time are selected, the applicant is navigated to an
`Add more details
about you`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page. This page asks the
applicant to enter their `Full name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Phone number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The contact
information entered on this form is how the applicant is contacted to
remind them about the scheduled interview.

When everything is entered on the
`Add more details about you`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page,
the applicant clicks the `Confirm Appointment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, and the interview is scheduled.

![The confirmation page with all the details for the interview displayed.](schedule_interviews/confirmation.png)

After confirming the interview, the applicant is taken to a confirmation
page, where all the details of the interview are displayed. The option
to add the meeting to the applicant\'s personal calendars is available,
through the `Add to iCal/Outlook`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Add to Google Agenda`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons,
beneath the interview details.

The applicant is also able to cancel or reschedule the interview, if
necessary, with the `Cancel your appointment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} link at the bottom of the confirmation.

# Source analysis reporting

Reporting is a critical tool used by recruiting departments to gain
insights into the entire recruitment process.

Determining where applicants come from can provide information about
which sources have the best results. This information is determined by
the *Source Analysis* report. With this data, recruitment teams can
better pivot their recruiting strategies to gain better applicants, in
both quantity and quality.

## Open report

To access the *Source Analysis* report, navigate to
`Recruitment app --> Reporting
--> Source Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

This presents the data for the `fa-filter`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Last 365 Days Applicant`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, in a default `fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Graph)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view, showing
the amount of applicants by `Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and further separated by stage (`In Progress`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Hired`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"})

Hover the cursor over any column to view the specific numbers fort that
column.

![The default bar chart of the source analysis information.](source_analysis/source-analysis.png)

## Source effectiveness report

To identify which sources (e.g., job boards, social media, employee
referrals, company website) produce the most hires, the pivot table view
of the `Source Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report can
be configured to display further details.

To view the `Source Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report
in a pivot table, click the `oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
top-right corner. The data is presented in a pivot table, with rows
populated by job positions, and columns populated by stages.

To expand this chart to show what specific sources the applicants came
from, click the `fa-plus-square`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box above the columns, to
reveal a drop-down menu, and click `Source`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Each column is then grouped by the source, such as:
`Search engine`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Facebook`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`LinkedIn`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, etc. Each source displays
a separate count for `Applicant`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Hired`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Refused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

This information, as presented, makes it difficult to view the specific
numbers for each source. Click the `fa-exchange`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Flip axis)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, to
swap the information. After that, the rows represent the source, and the
columns represent the job positions, further divided by stage.

![The axes flipped in the source analysis report, in pivot table view.](source_analysis/source-pivot.png)

In this view, the total number of applicants, hired employees, and
refused applicants, are displayed for each source, as well as for each
stage by job position.

### Medium

Viewing the medium for the applicants can be beneficial to see which
specific medium is more successful.

*Mediums* are the specific methods the applicant used to discover and
then apply for job positions, such as organic search, paid search,
social media ad, email, etc.

To further group the results by medium, click into one of the
`fa-plus-square`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`[Source]`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} rows. Click
`Medium`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the resulting drop-down
menu. The row presents the specific mediums, relevant to that specific
source.

Once `Medium`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected for one
source, clicking into another row automatically reveals the specific
metrics for the mediums for that source.

![The sources rows, expanded to also show the medium for each source.](source_analysis/medium.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The only mediums that appear for a source, are mediums that have been
set on an applicant\'s form. If a medium has **not** been set for any
applicants, the medium does not appear in the drop-down rows beneath the
source.

For example, if no applicants applied with the medium *Google Adwords*,
that medium does **not** appear beneath the *Search engine* source row.

# Team performance

The *Team Performance* report in the **Recruitment** app shows how many
applicants each recruiter is managing.

This information is determined by the individuals populating the
`Recruiter
<recruitment/applicant-details>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} field on
each applicant form.

## Open report

To access the *Team Performance* report, navigate to
`Recruitment app --> Reporting
--> Team Performance`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

The number of `In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Hired`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Refused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} applicants for each
recruiter is displayed in a default `fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Graph)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view.

The information shown is for the `fa-filter`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Last 365 Days Applicant`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} default filter, as displayed in the search bar.

Hover the cursor over any column to view a popover window, displaying
the specific details for that column.

![The default bar chart of the team performance report.](team_performance/team-performance.png)

### Pivot table view

For a more detailed view of the information in the
`Team Performance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report, click the
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the top-right
corner. This displays all the information in a pivot table.

In this view, the job positions populate the rows, while the columns
populate the number of applicants. The first column,
`Applicant`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, is the total number of
applicants across all stages for that job position. The subsequent
columns display the total applicants that have been
`Hired`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Refused`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
for each job position.

The displayed information can be modified, if desired.

In this example, there are 20 total applicants. Out of those 20, eight
have been hired, five have been refused, and seven are still in the
recruitment process.

From the data presented, the `Experienced Developer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} job position is the most successful. This job position
has one of the highest number of total applicants (tied with the
`Marketing and Community Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
position), as well as the most hires.

This pivot table also shows that the
`Quality Control Inspector`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} position
is the hardest to fill, as it has the fewest total applicants.

![The detailed pivot table view.](team_performance/team-perf-pivot.png)

## Use case: recruiter performance over time

One way to modify this report is to show how recruiters are performing
over time. To show this information, begin with the
`Team Performance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report in the
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view.

Next, click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the search bar,
revealing a drop-down menu. Click `Add Custom Group`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} at the
bottom of the `oi-group`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, then click
`Recruiter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click away from the
drop-down menu to close it. Now, each row on the table represents a
recruiter.

![The pivot table now displaying the recruiters in the rows.](team_performance/by-recruiter.png)

To compare the team\'s performance over different time periods, click
the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the search bar.
Click `Application Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} in the
`fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Filters`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column, revealing various time periods to select.

In this example, the desired data is the comparison between the team\'s
performance in the third quarter (June - August) and the second quarter
(April - July). To do so, click `Q3`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Once clicked, the current year is also ticked. In this example, it is
`2025`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

After making this selection, a `fa-adjust`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Comparison`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column
appears. Click `Start Date: Previous Period`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to compare the third quarter with the second quarter,
for the various recruiters.

![A comparison table of recruiter totals of Q2 and Q3.](team_performance/compare.png)

From this report, some things can be extrapolated: the total number of
applicants, the number of hired applicants, the number of refused
applicants, and the number of applicants still in the recruitment
pipeline all increased.

Additionally, `Maggie Davidsons`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} had
the highest increase in number of hired applicants during the third
quarter, while their number of refused applicants went down.

# Velocity analysis

The *Velocity Analysis* report provides information on how long
applicants stay in each stage of the recruitment process. This is
important, as every job position has specific `process details
<recruitment/new_job_position/edit>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} that
state the length of time applicants should expect to wait between
specific stages.

Knowing how long applicants remain in each stage can help highlight
possible bottlenecks. Analyzing this data allows the recruitment team to
assess each stage, identify any issues, and pivot their strategies to
move applicants through each stage, within the expected time interval.

## Velocity analysis report

To access the report, navigate to
`Recruitment app --> Reporting --> Velocity
Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. By default, the
report displays data for all job positions, with the stages populating
the x-axis, and the number of days populating the y-axis, in a
`fa-line-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Line Chart)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The default filter is `Last 365 Days Applicant`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, showing information for the last 365 days.

Hover over a stage in the line chart to reveal a popover window listing
all the job positions within it, and the average number of days each job
position sits in each stage.

For a more visually digestible view of the information in the
`Velocity Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report, click the
`fa-bar-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Bar Chart)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the upper-left
corner. This displays all the information in a bar chart.

In this view, it is easier to visualize the differences between the job
positions, regarding how long applicants stay in each stage. From this
view, recruiters can determine which job positions have delays or
bottlenecks at certain stages.

![The bar chart view of the Velocity Analysis report.](velocity_analysis/bar-chart.png)

### Use case: comparing times by month

With the `Velocity Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report,
it is possible to see if there are certain months where applicants take
longer to be moved through the pipeline. To view this data, switch to

After doing so, the data presented is grouped with the various months
from the previous 365 days for the rows, leaving the
`Days In Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as the columns.

![The pivot table showing the months averages for times in stage.](velocity_analysis/time-dates.png)

In this example, `July 2024`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} had the
longest time that applicants spent in each stage, on average. In
addition, the `Contract Proposal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
stage had the longest wait time in July, with an average of
`31.62`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} days in that stage.

While this report does not display the reasons applicants stayed in the
various stages for these lengths of time, it can be helpful to know when
delays occur.

# Recruitment

Odoo keeps all job applicants organized with a preconfigured series of
steps and stages that each applicant goes through. Each stage has a
specific steps that should be performed. These range from scheduling a
phone call, conducting an interview, or sending a job offer, for
example. This process is referred to as the *applicant flow.*

When an applicant applies for a job position, an *applicant card* is
automatically created in Odoo\'s **Recruitment** app for that specific
job position. As the applicant progresses through the recruitment
pipeline, the recruitment team moves their card from one stage to the
next.

`Stages can be configured <recruitment/modify-stages>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} so that an email is automatically sent out using a set,
preconfigured template as soon as an applicant\'s card enters a stage.
These automated emails are defined on each stage in the applicant flow.

The flow described in this document is Odoo\'s default configuration,
but it can be customized to suit any recruitment process.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Stages apply to all job positions unless `marked as job-specific
<recruitment/customize-stages>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} Changes to
stages (e.g., additions, deletions) affect all positions unless
explicitly scoped.
::::

## Settings {#recruitment/settings}

Before creating a job position in Odoo, configure the necessary settings
for the **Recruitment** app. To view and edit the settings, navigate to
`Recruitment app --> Configuration
--> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. After any changes
are made, click the `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in
the top-left corner to save all the changes.

### Process

The `Process`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the settings
page specifies what the database can and cannot do during the
recruitment process.

#### Send interview survey

Odoo is capable of having a survey sent to an applicant to gather more
information about them. Surveys can be thought of as exams, or
questionnaires, and can be customized in various ways to provide the
recruitment team with valuable insights into the applicant

Enable the `Send Interview Survey`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option to send surveys to applicants. Once enabled, an
`fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Interview Survey`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} internal link
appears. Click the `fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Interview Survey`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} link to navigate
to a list of all created surveys.

This list includes all surveys that were created in the database, not
only surveys used in the **Recruitment** app. If no surveys have been
created, the surveys list displays a `No
Survey Found`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} message, and presents
options to create a survey from several preconfigured survey templates.

::: seealso
`create/edit surveys <../marketing/surveys/create>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Enabling the `Send Interview Survey`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option will install the **Surveys** application once the settings are
saved, if not already installed.
::::

#### Salary package configurator

When sending an offer to an applicant, an expiration date can be set on
the offer. Enter the number of days an offer is valid for in the
`days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. After the set amount of
days has passed, if the applicant has not accepted the offer, the offer
is no longer available.

#### Résumé display {#recruitment/cv-display}

When applicants submit an application, one of the default required
fields is a résumé, or `CV
(curriculum vitae)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. All résumés are
stored in the **Documents** application, and are accessible on the
applicant\'s card.

A résumé has the option to appear on the applicant\'s form, which can be
viewed by clicking on the applicant\'s card. The résumé appears on the
right-side of the screen. If this is not enabled, the résumé is accessed
via a link in the chatter, where it needs to be clicked to expand and
view it, or downloaded.

Enable the `Résumé Display`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option to
show the résumé on the applicant\'s card by default, and in addition to
the document link. When enabled, the résumé appears on the right side of
the applicant\'s card.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

For the résumé to appear on the right-side, the browser window must be
in full-screen mode (where the browser spans the entire screen).

If the browser window is set to a size smaller than the entire width of
the screen (not full-screen), then the résumé does not appear on the
right-side. Instead, the résumé appears in the `Files`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section of the chatter, below the applicant\'s card.
::::

![The résumé on an applicant\'s card, appearing on the right side.](recruitment/cv-display.png)

### In-App Purchases

The `In-App Purchases`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu deals with items that
required credits to use, such as
`SMS (Short Message Service)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} text
messages, and digitizing résumés.

::: seealso
`SMS pricing and FAQs <../marketing/sms_marketing/pricing_and_faq>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

#### Send SMS

It is possible to send text messages to applicants directly through the
**Recruitment** app. This feature requires credits to use. Click the
`fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Manage Service & Buy
Credits`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} internal link, and follow
the steps to `purchase credits
<../marketing/sms_marketing/pricing_and_faq>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

#### Résumé digitization (OCR) {#recruitment/cv-ocr}

When an application is submitted using any of the available methods,
such as an online application submission, emailing a resume to the job
position alias, or creating an applicant record directly from the
database, it is possible to have Odoo extract the applicant\'s name,
phone number, and email address from the résumé and populate the
applicant\'s form. To do so, enable the `Résumé
Digitization (OCR)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option.

When enabled, additional options appear. Click on the corresponding
radio button to select one of the following options:

- `Do not digitize`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this option
  turns off résumé digitization.
- `Digitize on demand only`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this
  option only digitizes resumes when requested. A
  `Digitize document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons appears
  on applicant cards. When clicked, the résumé is scanned and the
  applicant\'s card is updated.
- `Digitize automatically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this
  option automatically digitizes all résumés when they are submitted.

Beneath these options are two additional links. Click the
`fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Manage
Service & Buy Credits`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} internal link
to purchase credits for résumé digitization. Click the
`fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`View My Services`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} internal link to
view a list of all current services, and their remaining credit
balances.

For more information on document digitization and
`IAP's (in-app purchases)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, refer to the
`In-app purchase (IAP) <../essentials/in_app_purchase>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Do not digitize`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option may
appear redundant but serves a distinct purpose. Disabling the
`Résumé Digitization (OCR)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option
uninstalls the module, while `Do not digitize`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} keeps the module installed but inactive---allowing the
user to re-enable digitization later without reinstalling the module.
::::

## Kanban view

To access the Kanban view for a job position, navigate to the main
`Recruitment`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app dashboard,
which is the default view when opening the application. All job
positions appear on the main dashboard. Click the
`(#) New Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button
on a job position card to navigate to the Kanban view for all the
applicants for that particular job position.

![Main dashboard view of job position card, showing new applications button.](recruitment/new-applicants-button.png)

Inside the job application, the Kanban stages appear, with all the
applicants populated in their respective columns, indicating what stage
they are currently in. In Odoo, six default stages are configured:

- `New <recruitment/new>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
- `Initial Qualification <recruitment/initial-qualification>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `First Interview <recruitment/first-interview>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Second Interview <recruitment/second-interview>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Contract Proposal <recruitment/offer_job_positions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}
- `Contract Signed <recruitment/offer_job_positions/contract-signed>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}

The last column, `Contract Signed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
is folded by default. Folded columns appear gray, and the applicants in
it are hidden from view. To expand the folded stage and view the
applicant cards for that column, click anywhere on the thin gray column
that says the stage name and the column expands, revealing the
applicants.

![Expand a folded column by clicking on it in the Kanban view.](recruitment/stages.png)

Each stage has a color-coded bar beneath the stage name, providing
status information for the applicant\'s in that specific stage. The
status colors are:

- `Green`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the applicant is ready to
  move to the next stage.
- `Red`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the applicant is blocked
  from moving to the next stage.
- `Gray`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the applicant is still in
  progress in the current stage and is neither ready nor blocked from
  the next stage.

The status for each card is set manually. To set the status, click on
the small circle in the lower-left of the applicant card. A status
pop-up window appears. Click on the desired status for the applicant.
The status dot on the applicant card as well as the status bar updates.

![The applicant card statuses, and status bar.](recruitment/status-dots.png)

The names for the three status colors ([In Progress]{.title-ref}, [Ready
for Next Stage]{.title-ref}, and [Blocked]{.title-ref})
`can be modified <recruitment/modify-stages>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, if desired.
::::

## Customize stages {#recruitment/customize-stages}

Stages can be modified, added, or deleted to match the particular hiring
steps of a business.

### New stage

To create a new stage, click on `fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a new column appears.
Enter the title for the new stage in the `Stage title`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, then click `Add`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The new column appears, and another new stage is
available to create. If no new stages are needed, click anywhere on the
screen to exit the new stage creation.

![The plus sign to click to add a new column to the Kanban stages.](recruitment/add-column.png)

### Modify stage {#recruitment/modify-stages}

To modify the settings of a stage, hover over the name of the stage, and
a `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Settings)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon appears in the upper right hand side of the stage.
Click on the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Settings)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and a menu appears.
Then click on the `Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. An
`Edit: (Stage)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form appears. Make
any desired modifications to the form, then click
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} when done.

![The gear icon that appears when a column name is moused over, and the drop-down menu it
displays when clicked.](recruitment/gear.png)

#### Edit stage form {#recruitment/edit-stage}

The `Edit: (Stage)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form is where the
stage\'s settings are configured. The only required field is the
`Stage Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The fields to be populated or modified are:

- `Stage Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Type in a name for
  the stage.
- `Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select an email
  template to be used from the drop-down menu. If a template is
  selected, when the applicant card enters the stage, an email is
  automatically sent to the applicant using the selected template.
- `Folded in Kanban`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Check the box
  to have the stage appear folded (hidden) at all times in the default
  view.
- `Hired Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Check the box if
  this stage indicates that the applicant is hired. When an applicant\'s
  card enters this stage, the card displays a `Hired`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} banner in the upper right corner. If this box is
  checked, this stage is used to determine the hire date of an
  applicant.
- `Job Specific`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the stage only
  applies to specific job positions, select the job positions from the
  drop-down menu. Multiple job positions can be selected.
- `Show in Referrals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Check the box
  if this stage should be seen in the *Referrals* application, and allow
  the referrer to accrue points when a referral of theirs reaches this
  stage. If this is active, a `Points`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field appears. Enter the amount of referral points
  the employee receives when an applicant enters this stage. The
  **Referrals** app must be installed in order to use this option.
- `Points`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If
  `Show in Referrals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is enabled,
  this field appears. Enter the number of points the employee earns when
  an applicant moves to this stage.
- `Tooltips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section: There are three
  preconfigured status labels (colored circles) for each applicant\'s
  card, indicating its status. These colors are displayed at the top of
  each stage to reflect the statuses of the applicants in the stage. The
  *names* for the label can be modified, but the label itself (the
  color) cannot. The default names and labels are:
  `In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (gray),
  `Blocked`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (red), and
  `Ready for Next Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (green).
- `Requirements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter any internal
  notes for this stage explaining any requirements of the stage.

### Delete stage

If a stage is no longer needed, the stage can be deleted. To delete a
stage, hover over the name of the stage, and a
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Settings)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon appears. First, click on the
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Settings)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon to reveal a drop-down menu, then click
`Delete`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. A
`Confirmation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up warning
appears, asking `Are you sure you want to delete
this column?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} Click
`Delete`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to delete the column.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If there are applicants currently in the stage being deleted, an error
pops up when attempting to delete the stage. The records currently in
the stage to need to be either deleted, archived, or moved to a
different stage before the stage can be deleted.
::::

## Email templates

To communicate with the applicant, Odoo has several preconfigured email
templates that can be used. The preconfigured email templates and when
to use them are as follows:

- `Recruitment: Applicant Acknowledgement`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: this template is used to let the applicant know that
  their application was received. This email is automatically sent out
  once the applicant is in the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  stage.
- `Recruitment: Interest`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this
  template is used to let the applicant know that their application
  caught the recruiter\'s attention, and they have been shortlisted for
  either a phone call or an interview.
- `Recruitment: Not interested anymore`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: this template is used when an applicant communicates
  that they are no longer interested in the position, and thanks them
  for their time and consideration.
- `Recruitment: Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this
  template is used when an applicant is no longer being considered for
  the position.
- `Recruitment: Schedule Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  this template is used to let the applicant know that they have passed
  the `Initial Qualification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage,
  and they will soon be contacted to set up an interview with the
  recruiter. This email is automatically sent out once the applicant is
  in the `Initial Qualification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  stage.

applicant\'s email address is entered in the `To`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, and the `Subject`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is [(Job Position)]{.title-ref}. The email body is
empty by default.

To use a preconfigured email template, click the
`fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(vertical
elipsis)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the bottom of the
window. Select the email template to use from the drop-down menu.

# Alerts

In the **Referrals** application, it is possible to post a message, also
referred to as an *alert*, at the top of the dashboard to share
important information with users.

Alerts remain on the main **Referrals** dashboard for the specified
amount of time configured on the individual alert.

![Two alert banners appear above the user\'s photo.](alerts/alerts.png)

## Create an alert {#referrals/create-alert}

Only users with *Administrator* access rights for the **Recruitment**
app can create alerts. To add a new alert, navigate to the
`Referrals app --> Configuration --> Alerts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open a blank alert
form. Enter the following information on the form:

- `Date From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date the alert
  starts. On this date, the alert is visible on the dashboard.

- `Date To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date the alert ends.
  After this date, the alert is hidden from view.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the current company
  populates this field, by default. To modify the company the alert
  should be displayed for, select the desired company from the drop-down
  menu in this field.

  If this field remains blank, the alert is visible to everyone with
  access to the **Referrals** app.

  If a company is specified, only users within that company (who also
  have access to the **Referrals** app) see the alert. This field
  **only** appears in a multi-company database.

- `Alert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the text for the
  alert. This message appears inside the alert banner on the main
  **Referrals** app dashboard.

- `On Click`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: there are three options
  for the alert. Click the radio button next to the desired selection.
  The options are:

  - `Not Clickable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the alert only
    displays text, there is no link to click.
  - `Go to All Jobs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the alert
    contains a link that, when clicked, navigates to the website with
    all the job positions that are currently posted.
  - `Specify URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the alert contains
    a link to a specific URL that, when clicked, navigates to that URL.
    When selected, a `URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
    appears below the `On
    Click`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Enter the desired
    URL in that field.

![An alert form completely filled in with all selections entered.](alerts/alert-form.png)

## Notify users

In addition to posting an alert on the **Referrals** app, users can be
contacted directly via email, instead of waiting for users to view the
alert when they open the **Referrals** app.

After `creating an alert <referrals/create-alert>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, click the `Send Mail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button above the alert form. This causes a `Send Mail`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window to load.

The currently configured users populate the `User`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, and the `Subject`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is populated with [New Alert In Referrals
App]{.title-ref}, by default.

The `Body`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is populated with [A new
alert has been added to the Referrals app! Check your dashboard
now!]{.title-ref}, with the word [dashboard]{.title-ref} linked to the
**Referrals** app dashboard.

Make any desired modifications to the email, then click
`Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Dismiss an alert

It is possible to dismiss an alert, if a user does not wish to see a
specific alert again.

To dismiss an alert, click the `fa-times`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(remove)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon on the far-right side
of the alert on the **Referrals** app dashboard, to remove the alert.

This prevents the alert from appearing again, even when opening the
**Referrals** app for the first time in a new session.

# Referral points

The *Referrals* application allows employees to earn points that are
then exchanged for `rewards <rewards>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

Current referral points can be viewed on the main *Referrals* app
dashboard, which appears when the application is opened, after the
`onboarding <referrals/onboarding>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} slides
have been viewed or skipped.

At the top, a summary of the user\'s current points is displayed. The
left side of the summary displays the `Total`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} points earned, and the right side displays the points
that are available `To Spend`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To view the various referral stages, and their respective earned points,
click one of the referral statuses beneath the avatar. The options are:
`Referrals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Ongoing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Successful`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The current number of referrals that are still active in the recruitment
pipeline, but have not yet been hired or refused, appear above
`Ongoing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The number of referrals
that have been hired, appears above `Successful`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The total number of referrals, both the ongoing and
successful referrals combined, appears above
`Referrals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## My referrals

To see all the referrals, both ongoing and successful, click
`Referrals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
`My Referral`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} screen page displays
all referrals, with each individual referral housed in its own referral
card.

A successful referral displays a white `fa-check`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Hired`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} badge in the
top-right corner of the card, along with a vertical green stripe on the
left-side of the card. Referrals that are in process have a purple
`In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} badge in the top-right
corner.

Each referral card lists the name of the applicant, the
subject/application title as it appears on the applicant card in the
*Recruitment* app, the name of the job position, the person responsible
for filling the role (i.e. the recruiter), and the points earned.

For referrals that have been hired, the selected avatar also appears on
the card.

![Two referral cards, one hired and one in-progress.](points/referrals.png){.align-center}

### Points

The points that can be earned for a referral are the same across all job
positions. Each stage of the recruitment process has corresponding
points assigned to it. The stages listed correspond to the stages
configured in the *Recruitment* application.

On each individual referral card, beneath the points earned, is a
progress bar that displays how many points have been earned out of the
total possible points that can be earned, if the applicant is hired.

Beneath the bar chart is a list of the various recruitment stages, and
the points earned when the referral moves to that stage. If a stage has
been achieved, and the points have been earned, a green
`fa-check`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(checkmark)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears next to the
stage.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The preconfigured point structure for referrals is as follows:

- `Initial Qualification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: 1 point
- `First Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: 20 points
- `Second Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: 9 points
- `Contract Proposal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: 5 points
- `Contract Signed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: 50 points

The default total points earned for a referral that is hired is 85
points. Modifications of the points earned for each stage are made in
the *Recruitment* application. Refer to the
`Recruitment <recruitment/modify-stages>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
documentation to modify the points for each stage.

# Points report

The points report in the **Referrals** app allows managers to view the
total `point <points>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} contribution from
employees, which can provide insight into the most effective referrers.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Only users with *Administrator* rights for the **Recruitment** app have
access to the reporting features in the **Referrals** app.
::::

To access the *Points* report, navigate to
`Referrals app --> Reporting --> Points`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. This loads the `Points`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} report in a default list view, grouped by
`User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, with the users listed in
alphabetical order, by first name.

All rows are collapsed by default, displaying the
`User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} name, the total number of
individual entries logged for the user, and the total
`Points`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} they have earned.

Click on a row to expand the entries for that user. Each line displays
the `Applicant`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the applicant reached, and
the corresponding `Points`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} earned for
the stage. The displayed `Points`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
appear in green if the user earned points for the stage, and appear in
black if no points are received for the stage.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Stages that do not earn referral points still appear on the list, if the
applicant reached that stage. In this example, applicants who reach the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage do *not* receive any
referral points, and zero (`0`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"})
appears in the `Points`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, in
black.

![Individual points earned by the user Bob Smith for all their referrals.](points_report/points-report.png)
::::

## Use case: most effective referrers

One way to use the `Points`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report is
to assess which users are referring successful applicants who become
employees. This is done by modifying the `Points`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} report to show only points earned from the
`Contract Signed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage.

To view only the successfully hired referrals, navigate to
`Referrals app -->
Reporting --> Points`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Click
into the search box, and click `Custom Filter...`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. This opens a
*Custom Filter* pop-up window.

By default, the first field is populated with `Stage`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and the middle field is populated with
`is equal to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Using the drop-down
menu in the last field, select `Contract
Signed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then click the
`Search`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

The `Points`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report now displays only
the successful referrals who were hired. The user with both the highest
number of entries next to their name, and the highest number of points
in the `Points`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, is the most
successful referrer.

::: example
In this example, it can be determined that `Joe Plumb`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is the most successful referrer, with three successful
referrals, for a total of `150`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
points.

# Referral analysis report

The reporting function in the **Referrals** app helps recruiters and
managers learn where applicants are applying from, when referred by a
current employee. Additionally, the reporting feature shows the number
of applicants hired, refused, and still in the recruitment pipeline, for
each medium.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Only users with *Administrator* rights for the **Recruitment** app have
access to the reporting feature in the **Referrals** app.
::::

## Employees referral analysis report

To access the *Employees Referral Analysis* report, navigate to
`Referrals app -->
Reporting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. This loads the
`Employees Referral Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report,
in a default `fa-bar-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Bar Chart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The graph is presented in a `fa-database`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Stacked`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view, with the number of
referrals on the y-axis, and the source, referred to as the
`Medium`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, of the applicant (e.g.:
*Facebook*, *LinkedIn*, *Email*, etc.) on the x-axis. If a medium does
**not** appear on the report, that indicates there are no referrals from
that particular medium.

Referral amounts for all stages are displayed, including
`Not Hired`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (refused),
`In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Hired`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The default filter is set to
the current month.

Hover over any bar to view a popover containing specific data for that
particular bar.

In this view, it is clear which `Medium`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is the most successful.

::: example
In this example, both `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`LinkedIn`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are the mediums with the
most referrals, but `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} has the
most referrals that were hired.

![The default report in the Referrals app.](referral_analysis/employee-report.png)
:::

### Use case: hired referrals

One way to use the reporting feature is to assess which employees are
referring the highest quality applicants. This is done by examining how
many of their referrals go on to become employees.

In this example, data is examined to determined which employee has the
highest number of hired referrals for the current year.

To view this information, first click the
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the upper-right
corner. Next, remove the current filter in the search bar.

Click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the search bar to
reveal a drop-down menu. Click `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
in the `fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, revealing a
drop-down menu of available time periods, and click the current year (in
this example, `2024`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

Next, click `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}, then deselect
`Earned Points`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Employee Referral Refused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to hide
those metrics. Click anywhere on the screen to close the drop-down menu.

The information displayed shows how many total applicants each employee
referred, and how many of those applicants were hired, for the current
year.

In this example, it can be determined that
`Bob Wilson`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is the most successful
referrer, with three hired referrals, and nine total referred
applicants. Additionally, `Mitchell
Admin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} has the lowest performance in
terms of referrals, as he has only one applicant, and no hires.

This information can be helpful to the recruitment team, so they can
determine the most active referrers in the company, and who is the most
successful in terms of hires.

![The customized report showing which employees have the most referrals and hires.](referral_analysis/employee-counts.png)

The pivot table can be inserted into a new or existing `spreadsheet
<../../productivity/spreadsheet/insert>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"},
if desired.

To do so, click the `Insert in Spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text

# Rewards

After employees have successfully earned referral points, they can
exchange their points by purchasing rewards in Odoo\'s **Referrals**
application. Rewards **must** be `created and
configured <referrals/create>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} before
employees can `redeem points for rewards
<referrals/redeem>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

## Create rewards {#referrals/create}

Rewards are the only configurations needed when setting up the
**Referrals** application.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Only users with
`Administrator rights <../../general/users/access_rights>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for the **Recruitment** application can create or modify
rewards.
::::

To add rewards, navigate to
`Referrals app --> Configuration --> Rewards`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and a reward form loads. Enter the following information on the form:

- `Product Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the name as
  it should appear for the reward. This field is required.

- `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the amount of points
  required to redeem the reward.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the company the
  reward is configured for using the drop-down menu. If a reward is
  available for multiple companies, each company **must** configure a
  reward for their specific company. This field **only** appears in
  multi-company databases; if this field appears, it is required.

  ::: example
  A database set up for three different companies offers a gift card as
  a reward. In the database, there are three separate rewards listed for
  a gift card, one for each of the three companies.
  :::

- `Gift Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  person responsible for procuring and delivering the reward to the
  recipient using the drop-down menu. This person is alerted when the
  reward is bought in the **Referrals** app, so they know when to
  deliver the reward to the recipient.

- `Photo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Add a photo of the reward,
  which appears on the rewards page.

- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab: Type in the
  description for the reward. This is visible on the reward card,
  beneath the title. This field is required.

![A filled out reward form with all details entered.](rewards/rewards.png)

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

It is advised to enter a `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
add a `Photo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If a cost is not
entered, the default cost is listed as zero, which would list the reward
as free in the reward shop. If a photo is not selected, a placeholder
icon is displayed on the rewards page.
::::

## Redeem rewards {#referrals/redeem}

In order to redeem a reward, points must be earned. These points can
then be used to purchase a reward.

To purchase a reward, click the `Rewards`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the main `Referrals`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard. All the configured rewards are listed in
individual reward cards.

The required point amount needed to purchase a reward is listed in the
top-right corner of the card.

If the user has enough points to purchase a reward, a
`fa-shopping-basket`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Buy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button appears at the bottom of
the reward card. If they do not have enough points for a reward, the
reward card displays
`You need another (x) points to buy this`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, instead of a `fa-shopping-basket`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Buy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

Click the `fa-shopping-basket`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Buy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on a reward to purchase
it. A *Confirmation* pop-up window appears, asking if the user is sure
they want to purchase the reward. Click `Ok`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to purchase the item, or `Cancel`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to close the window, and cancel the purchase.

After `Ok`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is clicked, the pop-up
window closes, and the points used to purchase the reward are subtracted
from the user\'s available points. The rewards presented are now updated
to reflect the user\'s current available points.

# Rewards report

In the **Referrals** app, it is possible to view a report of the rewards
that employees have redeemed. This can help determine the most popular
rewards and which rewards employees do not request.

Incentivizing employees to recruit highly qualified applicants is aided
by offering `rewards
<rewards>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} that entice employees to earn
points. Additionally, it can be helpful for the **Referrals** app
administrator to see what rewards are popular, to ensure a stock of
highly sought-after rewards is always available.

## Reward analysis

To view the *Reward Analysis* report, navigate to
`Referrals app --> Reporting -->
Rewards`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. This opens the
`Reward Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} report in a default
stacked (`fa-database`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}) bar chart
(`fa-bar-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}).

The X-axis is populated with the various rewards, while the Y-axis is
populated with the number of rewards redeemed by employees. All
employees who have redeemed rewards appear in their own identifying
color.

This report shows that `Chocolate Covered Nuts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} are the most desired reward, with 23 distributed to
employees. It can also be determined that employees do not often request
the `Sweatshirt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Backpack`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Tablet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Electric Bicycle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}; therefore,
inventory for those items does not need to be as high as the
`Chocolate Covered
Nuts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Share job positions

In Odoo **Referrals**, users can earn referral points by sharing job
positions with potential applicants. Individual job positions can be
shared in several ways: via `email
<referrals/email>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`SMS <referrals/sms>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`WhatsApp <referrals/whatsapp>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, a
`tracking link <referrals/link>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
various `social media platforms <referrals/social>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Additionally, *all* job positions can be
`shared via email <referrals/email-jobs>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
instead of sharing individual job positions.

:::: note
::: title

Sharing jobs can **only** occur after
`onboarding <referrals/onboarding>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} slides
have been viewed or skipped.
::::

## View all jobs {#referrals/view-jobs}

To see all job positions that are actively recruiting candidates, click
the `View Jobs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the main
**Referrals** app dashboard. This presents all job positions, with each
job presented with its own card.

![The View Jobs screen, displaying all current open job positions. All information is
displayed on the card.](share_jobs/jobs.png)

Each job position card contains the following information:

- The title of the job position. This information is taken from the *Job
  Position* field of the job form.
- The number of `Open Positions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  being recruited. This information is taken from the *Expected New
  Employees* field of the *Recruitment* tab of the job form.
- The total `points <points>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} a user earns
  when the referred applicant is hired for the position.
- The job description detailing the job position. This information is
  taken from the *Job Position* tab of the job form.

:::: note
::: title
Note

## Share an individual job

To share an individual job position, first click the
`View Jobs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the main
**Referrals** app dashboard. This presents a list of all currently
published jobs. From this page, an individual job can be shared with
someone using one of the methods below.

### Send email {#referrals/email}

To share an individual job position via email, click the
`fa-envelope-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Send
Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the specific job
position card. A preconfigured email template appears in a pop-up
window, using the `Send Job Offer by Mail`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} template. Enter the recipient\'s email address in the
`Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

The `Subject`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Body`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are populated using a default
template. The `Subject`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} [Job for
you]{.title-ref} is present, by default, but can be modified, if
desired.

The specific title of the job position populates the *Job Position*
placeholder in the email body. The [See Job Offer]{.title-ref} text in
the email body is an individualized tracking link to the specific job
position listed on the website.

When the prospective employee receives the email, the link sends them to
the job position page, where they can apply for the position, and the
person who referred them is tracked in the **Referrals** app.

If desired, add any text or closing salutation to the email body. When
all edits have been made, click `Send Mail`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to send the email, or click `Cancel`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to close the pop-up window.

### Job page

To see all the details for a job position, click the
`fa-globe`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Job Page`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the specific card. Doing so opens the job
position webpage in a new browser tab. This is what an applicant sees
before applying for a position.

### Share now {#referrals/link}

To share the job position with a customized tracking link, click the
`fa-chain`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Share Now`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to copy the link. A pop-up window in the corner
of the computer loads, stating [Referral link: (link to Job Position)
has been copied to clipboard]{.title-ref}.

Next, share the link with the prospective employee.

### Share a job via social media {#referrals/social}

Other than sending an email, SMS, WhatsApp message, or sharing a
tracking link, job positions can be shared via social media platforms
(`Facebook <referrals/facebook>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`X <referrals/x>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
`LinkedIn <referrals/linkedin>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. On each
job position card are the three corresponding social media icons that
can be used to share the job position, keeping track of applicants in
the **Referrals** application.

#### Facebook {#referrals/facebook}

To share the job position using Facebook, click the
`fa-facebook`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Share Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

If the user is already logged into Facebook, when the
`fa-facebook`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Share Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is clicked,
Facebook loads in a new tab, where a `Create post`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window loads with the tracking link attached.

To share the job via Facebook,first, the user **must** be logged into
Facebook. If the user is *not* already logged in, when the
`fa-facebook`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Share Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is clicked, a new
tab loads, stating [You are not logged in. Please login and try
again.]{.title-ref}
::::

#### X (formerly Twitter) {#referrals/x}

To share a job position on X, click the `X Share Now`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

If the user is already signed-in to X, when the
`X Share Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is clicked, an X
page loads in a new tab with a pre-populated message ready to post, in a
draft pop-up window. If the user is *not* already signed-in, a sign-in
screen loads instead, prompting the user to first sign-in to X.

Type in any additional information, or make any edits to the default
message, then share using the available options in X.

#### LinkedIn {#referrals/linkedin}

To share a job position on LinkedIn, click the
`fa-linkedin`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Share Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

If the user is already logged into LinkedIn, when the
`fa-linkedin`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Share Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is clicked, a new
tab loads in LinkedIn, with a link to the job position at the top. If
the user is *not* already logged in, a log-in screen loads instead,
prompting the user to log-in to LinkedIn first.

The job position can be shared either in a public post, or in a private
message to an individual (or group of individuals).

Type in any additional information, or make any edits to the message or
post, then share using the available options in LinkedIn.

## Share job list {#referrals/email-jobs}

Another way to share job opportunities is to share the entire current
list of open job positions, instead of one job position at a time. To do
this, navigate to the `Referrals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} main dashboard. Click the
`Email a friend`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the bottom
of the screen. A `Send Job Offer by Mail`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears.

Enter the email address in the `Email`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. The email can be sent to multiple recipients by
separating each email address with a comma followed by a single space.
The `Subject`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is preconfigured with
`Job for you`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, but can be edited. The
email `Body`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is also populated with
preconfigured text.

The link to all active job positions is a tracking link to a complete
list of all job positions currently being recruited for. Add any
additional text and make any edits to the message body, if necessary.
Then, click `Send Mail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to send the
email. This sends the message, and closes the window.

# Referrals

Odoo\'s **Referrals** application is a centralized place where all
information regarding referrals is housed - from points earned,
coworkers hired, and rewards selected. Users can recommend people they
know for job positions, and then earn referral points as those people
progress through the recruitment pipeline. Once enough referral points
are earned, they can be exchanged for prizes. The **Employees**,
**Recruitment**, and **Website** apps must all be installed for the
**Referrals** app to function.

The only configurations needed for the **Referrals** app *after* it has
been installed, are related to the
`rewards <referrals/rewards>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}; everything
else is preconfigured when Odoo **Referrals** is installed.

Users with either `Referral User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Officer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} access rights for the
**Recruitment** app can access the **Referrals** app. Only users with
`Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} access rights for the
**Recruitment** app have access to the
`referral analysis <referrals/referral_analysis>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} report and configuration menus. For more information on
users and access rights, refer to these documents:
`../general/users`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
`../general/users/access_rights`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

## Onboarding {#referrals/onboarding}

When opening the **Referrals** app for the first time, a preconfigured
onboarding script appears. This script consists of four slides, each
explaining the different parts of the **Referrals** app. At the top of
the dashboard, the following message is displayed throughout all the
onboarding slides:
`GATHER YOUR TEAM! Job Referral Program`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Behind this main message is an image, and beneath it
some more explanatory text.

Each of the onboarding slides has a corresponding image and message that
is displayed. After reading each message, click the
`Next`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-angle-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} button to advance to the
next slide.

The text that appears on each slide is as follows:

1.  `OH NO! VILLAINS ARE LURKING THE CITY! HELP US RECRUIT A TEAM OF SUPERHEROES TO SAVE
    THE DAY!`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
2.  `BROWSE THROUGH OPEN JOB POSITIONS, PROMOTE THEM ON SOCIAL MEDIA, OR REFER FRIENDS.`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}
3.  `COLLECT POINTS AND EXCHANGE THEM FOR AWESOME GIFTS IN THE SHOP.`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}
4.  `COMPETE AGAINST YOUR COLLEAGUES TO BUILD THE BEST JUSTICE LEAGUE!`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The onboarding slides will appear every time the **Referrals** app is
opened, until all the slides have been viewed and the
`Start Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button has been clicked.
If the onboarding is exited at any point, or if the
`Start Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button has *not* been
clicked, the onboarding slides will begin again when the **Referrals**
app is opened. Once the `Start Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button has been clicked, the onboarding slides will not be seen again,
and the main dashboard will load when the **Referrals** app is opened
from that point on.
::::

At any point during onboarding, click the `Skip`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to open the main **Referrals** dashboard.

![An onboarding slide with the skip and next buttons visible at the bottom.](referrals/onboarding.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If there are any candidates hired that the user had referred prior to
opening the **Referrals** app (meaning the onboarding slides have not
appeared before), when `Start Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
clicked at the end of onboarding, instead of going to the main
dashboard, a `hired
<referrals/hired>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} screen appears instead.
::::

### Modifying onboarding slides

Onboarding slides can be modified if desired. Only users with
`Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} rights for the
**Recruitment** app can modify onboarding slides. To edit a slide,
navigate to
`Referrals app --> Configuration --> Onboarding.`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} Each line displays the text for the individual
onboarding slide. To edit an onboarding slide, click on an individual
slide line to open the slide\'s onboarding form.

Make any changes to the message in the `Text`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. A `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
may be selected, as well. However, if this field is populated, that
slide is *only* displayed for that particular company.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field only appears when
in a multi-company database.
::::

The image can be modified, as well. Hover over the image thumbnail in
the top-right corner of the form. An `fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Edit)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and
`fa-trash-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Clear)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon appear. Click the `fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Edit)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to change
the image. A file navigator window loads. Navigate to the desired image,
select it, then click `Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The new
image appears in the thumbnail. To delete an image, click the
`fa-trash-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Clear)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon, then select a new image using the
`fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Edit)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon.

![An onboarding slide in edit mode, with the main fields highlighted.](referrals/edit-onboarding.png)

The sequence in which the slides appear can be changed from the
*Onboarding* dashboard. Click the `oi-draggable`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(draggable)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to
the left of the slide text, and drag the slide to the desired position.

![The onboarding slides in a list, with the drag and drop arrows highlighted.](referrals/onboarding-reorder.png)

## Hired referrals {#referrals/hired}

When a candidate referred by a user is hired, the user *\"grows their
superhero team\"* and adds superhero avatars to their **Referrals**
dashboard.

After a referral has been hired, when the user next opens the
**Referrals** app, instead of the main dashboard, a hired page loads.
The text `(REFERRAL NAME) HAS BEEN HIRED! Choose an avatar
for your new friend!`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears.

Below this message are five avatar thumbnails to choose from. If an
avatar has already been assigned to a referral, the thumbnail is grayed
out, and the name that the avatar has been chosen for appears beneath
the avatar. Click on an available avatar to select it.

If more than one referral was hired since completing onboarding in the
**Referrals** app, after selecting the first avatar, the user is
prompted to select another avatar for the subsequent hired referral.
Once all avatars have been selected, the dashboard loads and all the
avatars are now visible. Mouse over each avatar and their name is
displayed above them.

![The hired screen. A selection of avatars are presented to choose from, with any already
chosen are greyed out.](referrals/avatars.png)

### Modify friends

Friend avatars are able to be modified in the same manner that
`levels <referrals/levels>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are modified.
Only users with `Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
rights for the **Recruitment** app can make modifications to friends.
The preconfigured friends can be seen and modified by navigating to
`Referrals app --> Configuration --> Friends`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Each friend\'s avatar appears in the
`Dashboard Image`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, and the
corresponding name appears in the `Friend
Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. The default images are
a motley group of hero characters, ranging from robots to dogs.

To modify a friend\'s dashboard image, thumbnail, name, or position,
click on an individual friend to open the referral friend form. Type the
name in the `Friend Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. The
name is solely to differentiate the friends in the configuration menu;
the friend\'s name is not visible anywhere else in the **Referrals**
app.

The `Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be set to either
`Front`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Back`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. This determines the position of the friend in relation
to the user\'s super hero avatar. Click the radio button next to the
desired selection, and the friend will appear either in front of or
behind the user\'s avatar when activated.

If desired, both the thumbnail `Image`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and the `Dashboard Image`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} can be modified. Hover over the image being replaced to
reveal an `fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Edit)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and
`fa-trash-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Clear)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon. Click the `fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Edit)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, and a
file explorer window appears. Navigate to the desired image file, then
click `Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to select it.

To cancel any changes made, click the `fa-times`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Discard all changes)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon to delete any changes, and revert to the original content.

![A friend form in edit mode.](referrals/edit-friend.png)

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

It is not advised to edit the images. An image file must have a
transparent background in order for it to render properly. Only users
with knowledge about transparent images should attempt adjusting any
images in the **Referrals** app.

Once an image is changed and the friend is saved, it is **not possible**
to revert to the original image. To revert to the original image, the
**Referrals** app must be *uninstalled then reinstalled.*
::::

## Levels {#referrals/levels}

The **Referrals** app has preconfigured levels that are reflected in the
user\'s avatar on the **Referrals** dashboard. As a user refers
potential employees and earns points, they can *level up*, much like in
a video game.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Levels have no functional impact on the performance of the app. They are
solely used for the purpose of adding achievement tiers for participants
to aim for, gamifying referrals for the user.
::::

The user\'s current level is displayed at the top of the main
**Referrals** app dashboard, directly beneath their photo, in a
`Level: #`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} format. In addition, a
colored ring appears around the user\'s photo, indicating how many
points the user currently has, and how many additional points they need
to level up. The cyan colored portion of the ring represents points
earned, while the white colored portion represents the points still
needed before they can level up.

### Modify levels

Only users with `Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
rights for the **Recruitment** app can modify levels.

:::: warning

It is not advised to edit the images. An image file must have a

Once an image is changed and the level is saved, it is **not possible**
to revert to the original image. To revert to the original image, the
**Referrals** app must be *uninstalled then reinstalled.*
::::

The preconfigured levels can be seen and modified by navigating to
`Referrals app -->
Configuration --> Levels`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Each
avatar appears in the `Image`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column,
and the corresponding level number appears in the
`Level Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. The default
images are of Odoo superheroes, and each level adds an additional
element to their avatar, such as capes and shields.

To modify a level\'s image, name, or points required to reach the level,
click on an individual level in the list to open the level form, then
make modifications.

Type in the name (or number) of the level in the
`Level Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. What is entered
is displayed beneath the user\'s photo on the main dashboard when they
reach that level. Enter the number of referral points needed to reach
that level in the `Requirements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. The points needed to level up are the total accumulated points
earned over the lifetime of the employee, not additional points from the
previous level that must be earned.

If desired, the `Image`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can also be
modified. Hover over the image to reveal an
`fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Edit)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon and a `fa-trash-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Clear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon. Click the
`fa-pencil`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Edit)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon and a file explorer window appears. Navigate to
the desired image file, then click `Open`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to select it.

To cancel any changes made, click the `fa-times`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Discard all changes)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon to delete any changes, and revert to the original content.

![A level form in edit mode.](referrals/levels.png)

### Level up

Once enough points have been accumulated to level up, the circle around
the user\'s photo is completely filled in with a cyan color, a large
image stating `LEVEL UP!`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears
above the photo, and the phrase `CLICK TO LEVEL UP!`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} appears beneath the user\'s photo and current level.

Click on either the `LEVEL UP!`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
graphic, the user\'s photo, or the text `CLICK TO
LEVEL UP!`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} beneath the user\'s photo
to level up the user. The user\'s avatar changes to the current level,
and the ring around the photo is updated to indicate the current amount
of points.

Leveling up does not cost the user any points, the user only needs to
earn the specified amount of points required.

![A \'Click to level up!\' appears beneath the user\'s image, and a large \'Level up!\' appears
above their image.](referrals/level-up.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Once a user has reached the highest configured level, they will continue
to accrue points that can be redeemed for rewards, but they are no
longer able to level up. The ring around their photo remains solid cyan.

# Allocations

Allocations are amounts of time off given to employees, either granted
immediately or earned as the employee works, through an accrual plan.

Once `time off types <time_off/time-off-types>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `accrual plans
<time_off/accrual-plans>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} have been
configured, the next step is to *allocate*, or give, time off to
employees.

The *Allocations* page of the **Time Off** app is **only** visible to
users who have either *Time Off Officer* or *Administrator* access
rights for the **Time Off** application. For more information on access
rights, refer to the
`access rights <../../general/users/access_rights/>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation.

## Allocate time off {#time_off/allocation-form}

To create a new allocation, navigate to `Time Off app --> Management -->
Allocations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

This presents a list of all current allocations, including their
respective statuses.

Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to allocate time off, and
a blank `Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form appears.

After entering a name for the allocation on the first blank field of the
form, enter the following information:

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a name for the
  allocation, typically containing the type of time off, and the period
  of time it is available (example: [Annual Vacation Time Off -
  2025]{.title-ref}).

- `Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  drop-down menu, select the type of time off that is being allocated to
  the employees.

- `Allocation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select how the
  allocation is granted. Choose `Regular
  Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if the time off is
  given immediately, or `Accrual Allocation`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} if the time off is earned through an
  `accrual plan <time_off/accrual-plans>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

- `Accrual Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If
  `Accrual Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected
  for the `Allocation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
  `Accrual Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears. Using
  the drop-down menu, select the accrual plan associated with the
  allocation. An accrual plan is **required** when using the
  `Accrual Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} type.

- `Validity Period/Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If
  `Regular Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected
  for the `Allocation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, this
  field is labeled `Validity Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  If `Accrual Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected
  for the `Allocation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, this
  field is labeled `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  The current date populates the first date field, by default. To select
  another date, click on the pre-populated date to reveal a popover
  calendar window. Navigate to the desired start date for the
  allocation, and click on the date to select it.

  If the allocation expires, select the expiration date in the next date
  field. If the time off does *not* expire, leave the second date field
  blank.

  If `Accrual Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected
  for the `Allocation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, this
  second field is labeled `Run until`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.

- `Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the amount of
  time that is being allocated to the employees. This field displays the
  time in either `Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, depending on how the
  selected `Time Off Type <time_off/time-off-types>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} is configured.

- `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the employee being allocated the time off.

- `Add a reason...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If any
  description or note is necessary to explain the time off allocation,
  enter it in this field at the bottom of the form.

![A new allocation form with all the fields filled out for the annual two week vacation
granted to all employees.](allocations/new-allocation.png)

### Accrual start date behavior

If the `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is in the middle
of an accrual period, Odoo adjusts it to the start or end of that period
based on the *Accrued Gain Time* entered on the `accrual plan
<time_off/accrual-plans>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

::: example
\- *At the start of the accrual period*: A
`Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of
[06/16/25]{.title-ref} applies from [06/01/25]{.title-ref} - *At the end
of the accrual period*: A `Start Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of [06/18/25]{.title-ref} applies from
[07/01/25]{.title-ref}
:::

Automatic adjustments on the start date to either the begining or end of
an accural period ensures accruals align with the defined period
boundaries, rather than the exact date entered.

### Multiple requests

When allocating time off, it is common to allocate time to several
employees at once. This is done using the
`Multiple Requests`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature.

To allocate time to multiple employees in a single allocation, navigate
to `Time Off
app --> Management --> Allocations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, click the `fa-gear`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Actions)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
upper-left corner, then click `fa-users`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Multiple Requests`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This reveals a
`Multiple Requests`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.

This form is identical to the
`Allocation form <time_off/allocation-form>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, with an additional `Mode`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. The `Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field determines how multiple employees are selected.

Using the drop-down menu, select a `Mode`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from one of the following options:

- `By Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This option allows
  for the selection of multiple individual employees that are unrelated
  in terms of department, company, or tags. Selecting this reveals an
  `Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Select the
  employees to receive the allocation in the
  `Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. There is no
  limit to the amount of employees that can be selected.
- `By Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This option allows
  for the selection of all employees within a specific company.
  Selecting this reveals a `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  field. Select the `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
  assign the allocation to. Only one company can be assigned in the
  `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. When a company is
  selected, *all* employees within the company receive the allocation.
- `By Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This option allows
  for the selection of all employees within a specific department.
  Selecting this reveals a `Department`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field. Select the `Department`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to assign the allocation to. Only one department can
  be assigned in the `Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  field. When a department is selected, *all* employees within the
  department receive the allocation.
- `By Employee Tag`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This option
  allows for the selection of all employees with a specific tag.
  Selecting this reveals an `Employee Tag`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field. Select the desired
  `Employee Tag`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to select all
  employees with that tag. Only one tag can be assigned in the
  `Employee Tag`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. When a tag is
  selected, *all* employees with that tag receive the allocation.

Next, select the `Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
using the drop-down menu. Once a `Time Off
Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, the placeholder
name, \'Allocation Request\', changes to the name of the selected
`Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, including the amount
of days. Change the name of the allocation, if desired.

Fill out the remainder of the
`Multiple Requests form <time_off/allocation-form>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, then click `Create Allocations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} when done.

::: example
A company hosts an annual picnic, including a raffle. There are five
raffle prizes for a free vacation day, which must be redeemed by the end
of the year. The winners of this raffle all have the tag [Raffle
Winner - 2025 Employee Picnic Prize]{.title-ref} added to their employee
profiles.

The time off officer creates multiple allocations, and configures the
`Multiple Requests
form <time_off/allocation-form>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} as
follows:

The name for the allocation is
`Vacation Day - Raffle Prize - 2025 Picnic`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The `Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set
to `By Employee Tag`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Tag`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} identified is
`Raffle Winner - 2025 Employee Picnic Prize`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

The `Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
`Vacation Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, with the
`Allocation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set to
`Regular Allocaiton`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, since the time
off is given up front, and is not *earned*.

The `Validity Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
`07/18/2025`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`12/31/2025`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, since the compnay
picnic was that day, and the earned vacation day expires at the end of
the year.

The `Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
`1.00 Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and [A bonus vacation
day won at the annual Company Picnic.]{.title-ref} appears in the
details at the bottom.

![An allocation request form filled out for a bonus vacation day for raffle winners.](allocations/multiple-requests.png)
:::

## Request allocation {#time_off/request-allocation}

If an employee has used all their time off, or will run out of time off,
they can request an allocation for additional time. Allocations can be
requested in one of two ways, either from the
`Dashboard <time_off/dashboard>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or the
`My Allocations <time_off/my-allocations>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
view.

To create a new allocation request, click either the
`New Allocation Request`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on
the main **Time Off** dashboard, or the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the `My Allocations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} list view. Both buttons open a new allocation request
form.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Both options open a new allocation request form, but when requested from
the `Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the form appears in
a pop-up window, and the *Validity Period* field does **not** appear.

When requested from the `My Allocations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} list view, the screen navigates to a new allocation
request page, instead of presenting a pop-up window.
::::

Enter the following information on the new allocation request form:

- `Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  drop-down menu, select the type of time off being requested for the
  allocation. After a selection is made, the title updates with the time
  off type.
- `Validity Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: By default, the
  current date populates this field, and it is **not** able to be
  modified. This field **only** appears when requesting an allocation
  from the `My Allocations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view
  (`Time Off --> My Time --> My Allocations`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}).
- `Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the amount of
  time being requested in this field. The format is presented in either
  `Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Hours`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, depending on how the `Time
  Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is configured. Once this
  field is populated, the name of the allocation request is updated to
  include the amount of time being requested.
- `Add a reason...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a
  description for the allocation request in this field. This should
  include any details that approvers may need to approve the request.

If the request was created from the `Dashboard`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, click the `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the `New Allocation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window to save the information and submit the
request.

If the form was completed from the `My Allocations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} list view, the information is automatically saved as it
is entered.

# Management

::: {#time_off/approvals}
Time off and allocation requests undergo an approval process before
being granted. Requests either need one or two approvals, if any,
depending on how the specific type of time off is configured. All these
configurations can be found under the *Management* section of the **Time
Off** application.
:::

Only users who can
`approve allocation and time off requests <employees/work-info-tab>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} see the `Management`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section in the **Time Off** application.

## Manage time off {#time_off/manage-time-off}

To view time off requests that need approval, navigate to
`Time Off app -->
Management --> Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Doing
so reveals the `All Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.

The only time off requests that are visible on this page belong to
employees the user either has `Time Off Officer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
access rights for in the **Time Off** application.

The default filter on the `All Time Off`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page is `fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Waiting For
Me`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This filter only presents time
off requests that need to be approved for current employees on the
user\'s team, with a status of either `To Approve`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Second Approval`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

On the left side of the `All Time Off`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, there are various grouping options that can be
used to narrow down the presented time off requests, located beneath the
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} headings.

Since only time off requests that need to be approved are shown, the
only `Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options are
`All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `To Approve`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `Second Approval`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

The various departments the user is a member of, and manages employees
under, also appear on the left side of the page, under
`Departments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If no requests fall under one of the status options or departments, that
status or department is **not** visible on the left-side menu.
::::

To only display time off requests for specific departments, click on the
`Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the left-hand side of
the page. Only requests within the selected department are then
presented.

The status column displays the status of each request, with the status
highlighted in a specific color.

The `To Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Second Approval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} requests are
highlighted in yellow, and are the only ones that appear in the list by
default.

If the `fa-filter`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Waiting For Me`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter is removed,
all statuses appear.

`Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} requests are highlighted
in green, `To Submit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (drafts)
requests are highlighted in blue, and the `Refused`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} requests are highlighted in gray.

To approve a time off request, click the
`fa-thumbs-up`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the end of the
line.

To validate a time off request that has already been approved, and is
waiting on a second approval, click the `fa-check`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the
end of the line.

To refuse a request, click the `fa-times`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the far end of the
line.

role="guilabel"} icon, and `fa-times`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons). Doing so loads
that specific time off request form. Depending on the rights of the
user, changes can be made.

To modify the request, make any desired changes to the form. All changes
are automatically saved.

It is also possible to approve, validate, or refuse the request from
this form. Click the `Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
to approve, the `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
validate, or the `Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
refuse the request.

## Manage allocations {#time_off/manage-allocations}

To view allocations that need approval, navigate to
`Time Off app --> Management -->
Allocations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Doing so reveals
the `Allocations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.

The user is only presented with allocations for employees they have
either `Time Off
Officer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} access rights for in
the **Time Off** application.

The default filters configured on the `Allocations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page are `First Approval`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `My Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. These
default filters only present employees that the user manages and are
awaiting their first approval. Approved and refused allocation requests
are not shown.

The left side of the `Allocations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
page has various grouping options to narrow down the presented
allocation requests.

The `Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options are:
`All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `To Approve`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Refused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click on a specific
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to view only requests with
that specific status.

To view all allocation requests, regardless of status, click
`All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under the
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading.

It is also possible to display allocation requests by department. Click
on the desired `Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
left side of the `Allocations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page,
to only present allocations for that specific department.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The groupings on the left side **only** present allocation requests that
fall under the default filters of `My Team`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Active Employee`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, if those default filters are not removed from the
`Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar. Only the statuses
for allocation requests that fall under those filters are presented on
the left side.

For example, if there are no requests with a status of
`To Submit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, that status option does
not appear in the left-hand side of the `Allocations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page.

All departments for the user\'s employees appear in the list. If there
are no allocation requests that fall under that department matching the
preconfigured filters, the list is blank.

It is always possible to remove any of the preconfigured filters, by
clicking the `fa-times`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(remove)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon on the specific
filter to remove it.
::::

The status column displays the status of each request, with the status
highlighted in a specific color. The `To Approve`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} requests are highlighted in yellow, and if the default
`First Approval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter is removed,
the `Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} requests are
highlighted in green, and the `Refused`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} requests are highlighted in gray.

To approve an allocation request, click the
`fa-thumbs-up`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the end of the
line. To refuse a request, click the `fa-times`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![Allocations with the filter, groupings, and status sections highlighted.](management/allocations.png)

If more details are needed, click anywhere on the allocation request
line (except for the `fa-thumbs-up`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`fa-times`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Refuse`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} buttons) to view the specific request in detail, via
the allocation request form.

Depending on the rights of the user, changes can be made to the
allocation request form that appears. To modify the request, make any
desired changes to the form. All changes are automatically saved.

It is also possible to approve or refuse the request from this form.
Click the `Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
approve, or the `Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
refuse the request.

# My time

The *My Time* menu of the **Time Off** app houses all the various time
off information for the signed-in user.

This includes the main **Time Off**
`dashboard <time_off/dashboard>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, which
displays an overview of the various time off balances, as well as
`time-off requests
<time_off/my-time-off>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`allocations <time_off/my-allocations>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

## Dashboard {#time_off/dashboard}

All users have access to the **Time Off** `Dashboard`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, which is the first page that appears when the **Time
Off** app is opened. The `Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
can also be accessed at any point in the application, by navigating to
`Time Off app --> My Time --> Dashboard`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

The dashboard shows a summary of the user\'s time off, and the entire
current year, with the current day highlighted in a red circle.

To change the view, click on the `Year`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to reveal a drop-down menu. Then, select either
`Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Week`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
present the calendar in that corresponding view.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To change the displayed dates, click the
`fa-arrow-left`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(left arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`fa-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(right arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icons to the left of
the `Year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. The calendar view
adjusts in increments of the selected view.

For example, if `Year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected,
the arrows adjust the view by one year.

To reset the view, so it includes the current date, click the
`Today`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.
::::

Above the calendar view is a summary of the user\'s time off balances.
Every time off type that has been allocated appears in its own summary
box. Each summary lists the type of time off, the corresponding icon,
the current available balance (in hours or days), and an expiration date
(if applicable).

To view the full details of a time off balance, click the
`fa-question-circle-o`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(question mark)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon at the end of
the `(DAYS/HOURS) AVAILABLE`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
time off summary. The complete details are presented in a popover
window, including the `Allocated`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
time, `Accrual (Future)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} time,
`Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} time off scheduled,
`Planned`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} time off, and the currently
`Available`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} time off.

![A view of the complete time off balance details in the popover window.](my_time/balance-details.png)

A user can also select a future date to see an estimate of how much time
they should accrue by that point. On the right side of the time off
summary blocks, there is a `Balance at the
(date)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Click on the date, and
a calendar selector popover appears.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Balance at the (date)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
**only** appears if the user is accruing time off through an
`accrual plan <time_off/accrual-plans>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

The current date is the default date selected. Navigate to the desired
date, and Odoo displays the time off balances the user should have on
that date. This takes into account all time off currently planned and
approved. To return to the current date, click the
`Today`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to the right of the
date field.

On the right side of the calendar, the various time off types are
displayed, each with their own corresponding color. The
`Legend`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} explains how the various
statuses for time off requests are presented.

Time off that has been validated appears in a solid color. Time off
requests that still are still in the `To Approve`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} stage, appear with white stripes in the color.
`Refused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} time off requests have a
line through the dates.

The color for each request corresponds to the specified color set with
the various time off types, listed in the section above the
`Legend`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

New time off requests can be made from the `Dashboard`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button in the upper-left corner, and a
`New Time Off <request_time_off>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} pop-up
window appears.

New allocation requests can also be made from the
`Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click the `New
Allocation Request`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to request
more time off, and a `New Allocation
<time_off/request-allocation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} pop-up
window appears.

![Time off dashboard view with the legend, time off summaries, and view buttons highlighted.](my_time/dashboard.png)

## My time off {#time_off/my-time-off}

To view a list of all the signed-in user\'s time off requests, navigate
to `Time Off
app --> My Time --> My Time Off`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Here, all time off requests, both past and
present, appear in a list view, grouped by month.

The list includes the following information for each request: the
`Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and

## My allocations {#time_off/my-allocations}

To view a list of all allocations, navigate to
`Time Off app --> My Time --> My
Allocations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. All allocations
and requested allocations appear in a list view.

The information presented on the `My Allocations`{.interpreted-text

# Reporting

The **Time Off** app\'s reporting feature lets managers view team time
off by employee, type, or remaining balances. This allows managers to
see `who is taking time off, how much they have
used <time_off/by-employee>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`which types are more commonly used <time_off/by_type>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and
`how much each employee still has available <time_off/balance>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Any report can be added to a spreadsheet, when in either the
`fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Graph)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view, through the *Insert
in Spreadsheet* button that appears in the top-left of a report.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the **Documents** app is installed, an option to add the report to a
spreadsheet appears. If not, the report can be added to a *Dashboard*.
::::

## By employee {#time_off/by-employee}

Viewing time off by employee helps managers track usage patterns,
monitor remaining balances, ensure policy compliance, and plan coverage
for upcoming absences. To view a list of employee time off requests,
navigate to
`Time Off app --> Reporting --> by Employee`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

The default report presents the current year\'s data in a list view,
displaying all the employees in alphabetical order. Each employee\'s
line is collapsed by default. To expand a line, click anywhere on the
line.

The view expands, and has the time off requests organized by time off
type. Click anywhere on a time off type line to expand it, and view all
the individual time off requests that fall under that type.

The information shown in the list includes: the
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} name, `Number of
Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} off requested, the
`Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Report of time off, shown by each employee in a list view.](reporting/employee-report.png)

The report can be displayed in other ways, as well. Click the
corresponding button option in the top-right corner of the page to view
the data in that specific way. The various options are a
`oi-view-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(List)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or default view, `fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(Graph)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} table, or
`fa-calendar`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Calendar)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view.

When a selection has been made, additional options appear for that
particular selection. For more detailed information on the reports and
their various options, refer to the `reporting
<../../essentials/reporting>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation.

## By type {#time_off/by_type}

Viewing company-wide time off by type can help managers determine if
employees are using their time off, which types are used more than
others, and can spot any trends. High totals in certain time off types,
like sick time off, can indicate health or morale concerns.

To view a graph of all time off, organized by time off type, navigate to
`Time Off
app --> Reporting --> by Type`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
This shows all time off requests in a default bar chart.

Hover over a bar to view the `Duration (Days)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of that specific time off type.

![The various time off types, and how many days requested, in a bar chart. Details are
highlighted in a red box.](reporting/bar-chart.png)

Click on a bar to go to a detailed list view of all the time off
requests for that time off type.

Each request is listed, with the following information displayed: the
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Number of Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Request Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The report can be displayed in other ways, as well. Click the
corresponding button option in the top-right corner of the page to view
the data in that way. The various options are a
`fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Graph)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (the default view),
`oi-view-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(List)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Pivot)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} table.

When a selection has been made, additional options appear for that
particular selection. For more detailed information on the reports, and
their various options, refer to the `reporting
<../../essentials/reporting>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation.

## Balance {#time_off/balance}

When some time off types have restrictions, such as rollover rules and
balance limits, viewing time off balances can help managers see a
high-level overview of time off. If certain employees have a lot of time
that will expire soon, they can inform their employees and adjust
scheduled accordingly to be prepared for their absences.

To view a pivot table of all time off balances, organized by time off
type, then further organized by how many days and hours are
`Left`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Planned`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, navigate to
`Time Off app --> Reporting --> Balance`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

This shows all time off balances in a default pivot table. The employees
populate the rows, while the various time off types and balances
populate the columns.

![The various time off balances, in a pivot table.](reporting/balance.png)

# Request time off

When employees wish to take time off, they first submit a time off
request through the **Time Off** application. Once their request has
been submitted, it is then reviewed by either the employee\'s manager or
their time off officer (depending on who the employee\'s
`time off approver is
<employees/approvers>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the time off type the employee is requesting
`does not require approval
<time_off/time-off-requests>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, the time
off is automatically approved, and does not need to be reviewed.
::::

## Submit time off request

To request time off, click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button in the top-left corner of the **Time Off** app dashboard, and a
`New Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up form loads.

Fill out the `fields on the form <time_off/fields>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and then click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to submit the request.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Requesting time off can be done either form the main **Time Off** app
dashboard, or by navigating to
`Time Off --> My Time --> My Time Off`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and clicking `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

![A time off request for three hours of vacation time off.](request_time_off/new-time-off.png)

### Time off fields {#time_off/fields}

Enter the following information on the `New Time Off`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} request form:

- `Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the
  drop-down menu, select the type of time off being requested.

- `Dates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the dates that the
  time off falls under. There are two fields to populate: the start and
  end dates. Click on either date field and a popover calendar appears.

  Click on the start date, then click on the end date. The selected
  start and end dates are circled, and the dates between them are
  highlighted (if applicable).

  If only requesting time off for a single day, click on the start date,
  then click the same date again for the end date.

  When the correct dates are selected, click the
  `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

  The selected dates now populate the two portions of the
  `Dates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

  If the selected `Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
  configured to have the time off taken in hours, the following two
  fields also appear:

  - `Half Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the time off
    request is for a half day, tick this checkbox. When this is
    selected, the second date field disappears, and is replaced with a
    drop-down menu. From that drop-down menu, select either
    `Morning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `Afternoon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to indicate which
    half of the day is being requested off.
  - `Custom Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the time off
    requested is not a whole or half day, tick this checkbox. If
    selected, a `From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
    `To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears beneath this
    option. Using the drop-down menu, select the start and end time for
    the time off request.

- `Requested (Days/Hours)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This
  field updates automatically once the `Date`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} section is completed. If the `Date`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} section is modified, this section automatically
  updates to reflect the total time off requested. This field is in
  either hours or days, depending on how the selected
  `Time Off Type <time_off/time-off-types>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} is configured.

- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a description
  for the time off request. This should include any details that
  managers and approvers may need to approve the request.

- `Supporting Document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field
  **only** appears if the `Time Off Type
  <time_off/time-off-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} selected
  allows for the attachment of documents. Click the
  `fa-paperclip`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `Attach File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and a file
  explorer window appears.

  Navigate to the desired files that should be attached, select them,
  then click The `Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. The
  files then appear on the time off request form. Multiple documents can
  be attached, if necessary.

# Time off

Odoo\'s **Time Off** application serves as a centralized hub for all
time-off-related information. This application manages requests,
balances, allocations, approvals, and reports.

Users can
`request time off <../hr/time_off/request_time_off>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, and see an overview of their requests and time off
balances. Managers can
`allocate time off <time_off/allocations>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
to individuals, teams, or the whole company, and
`approve time off requests
<time_off/manage-time-off>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Detailed `reports <time_off/reporting>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
can be run to see how much time off (and what kinds of time off) are
being used, `accrual plans <time_off/accrual-plans>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} can be created, and
`public holidays <time_off/public-holidays>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} can be set.

:::: note

## Configuration

In order to allocate time off to employees, and for employees to request
and use their time off, the various time off types must be configured
first, then allocated to employees (if allocation is required).

### Time off types {#time_off/time-off-types}

To view the currently configured time off types, navigate to
`Time Off app -->
Configuration --> Time Off Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. The time off types are presented in a list view.

The **Time Off** app comes with four preconfigured time off types:
`Paid Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Sick Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Unpaid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Compensatory Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and `Extra
Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. These can be modified to suit
business needs, or used as-is.

#### Create time off type

To create a new time off type, navigate to
`Time Off app --> Configuration --> Time
Off Types`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. From here, click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to reveal a blank time
off type form.

Enter the name for the particular type of time off in the blank line at
the top of the form, such as [Vacation]{.title-ref} or
[Bereavement]{.title-ref}. Then, enter the following information on the
form.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The only **required** fields on the time off type form are the name of
the `Time Off
Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Take Time Off In`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Kind of Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In addition, the
`Time Off Requests`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Allocation Requests`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sections
**must** be configured.
::::

##### Time off requests section {#time_off/time-off-requests}

This section determines how approvals are handled for time off requests
for this time off type.

- `Approval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select what specific
  kind of approval is required for the time off type. The options are:
  - `No Validation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: No approvals are
    required when requesting this type of time off. The time off request
    is automatically approved.
  - `By Time Off Officer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Only the
    specified `Time Off Officer
    <time_off/time-off-officer>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, set on
    this form in the `Notified Time Off Officer`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field, is required to approve the time off request.
    This option is selected, by default.
  - `By Employee's Approver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Only
    the employee\'s specified approver for time off, which is set on the
    *Work Information* tab on the
    `employee's form <employees/work-info-tab>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, is required to approve the time off request.
  - `By Employee's Approver and Time Off Officer`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}: Both the employee\'s `specified
    time off approver <employees/work-info-tab>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and the `Time Off Officer
    <time_off/time-off-officer>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are
    required to approve the time off request.

##### Allocation requests section

This section determines how allocation requests are handled for this
time off type.

- `Requires allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the time
  off must be allocated to employees, select `Yes`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. If the time off can be requested without time off
  being previously allocated, select `No Limit`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. If `No Limit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
  selected, the following options do not appear on the form.

- `Employee Requests`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
  `Extra Days Requests Allowed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if
  the employee is able to request more time off than was allocated.

  If employees should **not** be able to make requests for more time off
  than what was allocated, select the `Not Allowed`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} option.

  ::: example
  Ten days are allocated to the employee for this particular type of
  time off, and the `Extra Days Requests Allowed`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} option is enabled. The employee wants to take a
  vacation for twelve days. They may submit a request for two additional
  days, since the `Extra Days Requests Allowed`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} option is enabled.
  :::

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  It is important to note that requesting additional time off does
  **not** guarantee that time off is granted.
  ::::

- `Approval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the type of
  approvals required for the allocation of this particular time off
  type.

  - `No Validation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: No approvals are
    required when requesting additional allocations for the time off
    type. The allocation request is automatically approved.
  - `By Time Off Officer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Only the
    specified `Time Off Officer
    <time_off/time-off-officer>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, set on
    this form in the `Notified Time Off Officer`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field, is required to approve the allocation
    request. This option is selected, by default.
  - `By Employee's Approver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Only
    the employee\'s specified approver for time off, which is set on the
    *Work Information* tab on the
    `employee's form <employees/work-info-tab>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, is required to approve the allocation request.
  - `By Employee's Approver and Time Off Officer`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}: Both the employee\'s `specified
    time off approver <employees/work-info-tab>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and the `Time Off Officer
    <time_off/time-off-officer>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are
    required to approve the allocation request.

##### Configuration section

This section determines all other details regarding the time off type,
aside from approvals and allocations. This includes how the time off
must be taken (hours, half days, or days), if the time off is visible to
other users, and how the time off affects the **Payroll** app.

::: {#time_off/time-off-officer}
- `Notified Time Off Officer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
  the user who is notified and responsible for approving requests and
  allocations for this specific type of time off.

- `Take Time Off in`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  format the time off is requested in from the drop-down menu. The
  options are:

  - `Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if time off can only be
    requested in full day increments (8 hours).
  - `Half Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if time off can only
    be requested in half day increments (4 hours).
  - `Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the time off can be
    taken in hourly increments.

- `Deduct Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enable this
  option if the time off request should factor in any extra time accrued
  by the employee.

  ::: example
  If an employee works two extra hours for the week, and requests five
  hours of time off, the request would be for three hours, since the two
  extra worked hours are used first, and deducted from the request.
  :::

- `Public Holiday Included`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enable
  this option if public holidays should be included in time off
  requests.

  ::: example
  An employee in the United States requests time off for the week of
  July 4th, for a total of five days. Since the 4th of July is a holiday
  in the United States, the time off request is automatically modified
  to use four vacation days and one public holiday, instead of five
  vacation days. That is because the holiday is included, and the user
  does not need to use their own vacation time for a public holiday.

  This option reduces extra work for users, enabling them to make only
  one time off request for the entire week, instead of making two
  separate requests, one for the days *before* the holiday, and another
  one for the days *after* the holiday.
  :::

- `Allow To Attach Supporting Document`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: Enable this option to allow the employee to attach
  documents to the time off request. This is useful in situations where
  documentation is required, such as long-term medical leave.

- `Kind of Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: From the
  drop-down menu, select the type of time off, either
  `Worked Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Absence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  `Worked Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} indicates the time
  off taken counts toward worked time for any type of accrual the
  employee is working towards, whereas `Absence`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} does not count toward any type of accrual.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If multiple companies
  are created in the database, and this time off type only applies to
  one company, select the company from the drop-down menu. If this field
  is left blank, the time off type applies to all companies in the
  database. This field **only** appears in a multi-company database.
:::

##### Negative cap section

Enable the `Allow Negative Cap`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option if employees are able to request more time off than they
currently have, allowing a negative balance. If enabled, an
`Maximum Excess Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
appears. In this field, enter the maximum amount of negative time
allowed, in days.

::: example
Sara currently has three days of the time off type
[Vacation]{.title-ref}. She is planning a trip that requires five days
of time off.

The [Vacation]{.title-ref} time off type has the
`Allow Negative Cap`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option enabled,
and the `Maximum Excess Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
set to five.

These settings allow Sara to submit a request for five days of the
[Vacation]{.title-ref} time off type. If approved, her
[Vacation]{.title-ref} time off balance will be negative two (-2) days.
:::

![The top half of the time off type form, with all the information filled out for sick time
off.](time_off/time-off-type-form-top.png)

##### Payroll section

If the time off type should create
`../hr/payroll/work_entries`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} in the
**Payroll** app, select the `Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down list.

##### Timesheets section

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section only appears
if the user is in developer mode. Refer to the
`developer-mode`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} document for details on
how to access the developer mode.
::::

When an employee takes time off, and is also using timesheets, Odoo
creates entries in the **Timesheets** app for the time off. This section
defines how they are entered.

- `Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the project the
  time off type entries appear in.
- `Task`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the task that
  appears in the timesheet for this time off type. The default options
  are: `Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Meeting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Training`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

##### Display option section

- `Color`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select a color to be used
  in the **Time Off** app dashboard.
- `Cover Image`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select an icon to be
  used in the **Time Off** app dashboard.

![The lower half of the time off type form, with all the information filled out for sick time
off.](time_off/time-off-type-form-bottom.png)

### Accrual plans {#time_off/accrual-plans}

Some time off is earned through an accrual plan, meaning that for every
specified amount of time an employee works (hour, day, week, etc), they
earn or *accrue* a specified amount of time off.

::: example
If an employee accrues a vacation day for every week they work, they
would earn 0.2 vacation days for each hour they work. At the end of a
forty hour work week, they would earn one whole vacation day (8 hours).
:::

#### Create accrual plan

To create a new accrual plan, navigate to
`Time Off app --> Configuration --> Accrual
Plans`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Then, click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, which reveals a blank
accrual plan form.

Enter the following information on the form:

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the accrual plan
  name.

- `Accrued Gain Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select when
  the employee begins to accrue time off, either
  `At the start of the accrual period`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} or
  `At the end of the accrual period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Carry-Over Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select when the
  employee received previously earned time. The options are:

  - `At the start of the year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    Select this if the accrual rolls over on January 1 of the upcoming
    year.
  - `At the allocation date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
    this if the accrual rolls over as soon as time is allocated to the
    employee.
  - `Other`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this option if
    neither of the other two options are applicable. When selected, a
    `Carry-Over Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears.
    Select the date using the two drop-down menus, one for the day and
    one for the month.

- `Based on worked time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enable this
  option if time off accrual is determined by the employee\'s worked
  hours. Days **not** considered as worked time do **not** contribute to
  the accrual plan in Odoo.

  ::: example
  An employee is granted time off from an accrual plan configured to
  accrue one day of vacation for every five days worked. The accrual
  plan is based on the employee\'s worked time (the
  `Based on worked time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox is
  ticked), which means they **only** earn vacation time for the five
  weekdays they work, *not* the entire seven day week period.

  The employee works standard 40-hour weeks. According to the accrual
  plan, they should earn four vacation days per month.

  The employee takes five days off using a
  `time off type <time_off/time-off-types>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} with the `Kind of Time Off`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} set as an `Absence`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. Because the plan grants vacation only for worked
  time, those five days do not count toward accrual.

  As a result, the employee accrues only three vacation days that month
  instead of four.
  :::

- `Milestone Transition`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field
  is **only** visible after a minimum of two
  `rules <time_off/rules>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} have been
  configured on the accrual plan. This selection determines when
  employees move up to a new milestone. If they qualify to change
  milestones in the middle of a pay period, decide whether the employee
  changes milestones `Immediately`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `After this accrual's period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  (after the current pay period).

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field **only**
  appears in a multi-company database. Using the drop-down menu, select
  the company the accrual plan applies to. If left blank, the accrual
  plan is available for all companies.

![An accrual plan form with all the entries filled out.](time_off/accrual-plan-form.png)

##### Rules {#time_off/rules}

Rules must be created in order for employees to accrue time off from the
accrual plan.

To create a new rule, click the `New Milestone`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the gray `Rules`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, and a `Create Milestone`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} modal form appears.

Fill out the following fields on the form:

::: {#time_off/accrue}
- `Employee accrue`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  parameters for earned time off in this section.

  First, select either `Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the increment of
  accrued time using the drop-down menu.

  Next, enter the numerical amount of the selected parameter that is
  accrued. The numerical format is [X.XXXX]{.title-ref}, so that partial
  days or hours can also be configured.

  Last, select how often the time is accrued using the drop-down menu.
  The default options are `Hourly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Daily`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Weekly`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Twice a month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Twice a year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Yearly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  Depending on which option is selected, additional fields may appear.
  For example, if `Twice a month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
  selected, two additional fields appear, to specify the two days of
  each month the milestone occurs.

- `Cap accrued time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If there is a
  maximum amount of time the employee can accrue with this plan, enable
  this option.

  When enabled, two additional fields appear to the right of the
  checkbox. The second field is populated with either
  `Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Hours`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, matching the selection made in the
  `Employee Accrue <time_off/accrue>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  section.

  Enter a numerical value in the first field to specify the maximum
  amount of time that can be accrued, in the specified increments.

- `Start Accruing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the number
  and value of the time period that must pass before the employee starts
  to accumulate time off.

  Use the first field to enter a numerical value, then set the second
  field to the desired time increment (either `Days`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Years`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

- `Carry over`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select how any unused
  time off is handled. The options are either:

  - `None. Accrued time reset to 0`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    Any unused time off is lost.

  - `All accrued time carried over`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    All unused time off is rolled over to the next calendar year.

  - `Carry over with a maximum`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    Unused time off is rolled over to the next calendar year, but there
    is a cap. An `Up to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
    appears if this is selected.

    Enter the maximum number of `Hours`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} or `Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that
    can roll over to the following year. The presented time increment is
    determined by how the `Employee Accrue
    <time_off/accrue>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} section is
    configured.

    Any time off beyond this parameter is lost.
:::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If the `Carry over`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set to
`None. Accrued time reset to 0`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, that
rule *overrides* the `Carry-Over Time`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} set on the accrual plan.

If a company creates an accrual plan, granting employees time off
`At the start of the
accrual period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (i.e., the beginning
of the year), and sets the `Carry-Over Time`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the *accrual plan* to
`At the start of the year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, it allows
unused vacation time to rollover to the following year.

Then, the company adds rules to the accrual plan, allocating five days
of vacation, annually, on the first of the year (one week of vacation
allocated on January 1st).

If the `Carry over`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set to
`None. Accrual time reset to 0`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on
the `Create Milestone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up for,
any unused vacation time *does not* carry over, even though on the
`Accrual Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form, the
`Carry-Over Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
`At the start of the year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The carry over set on the *rule* takes precedence over the carry over
set on the *accrual plan form*.
::::

- `Milestone cap`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick this checkbox
  to set a limit on the total amount of time that can be accrued every
  calendar year. Enter the total maximum number of
  `Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Days`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} the employee can accrue during a year. The presented
  time increment is determined by how the
  `Employee Accrue <time_off/accrue>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  section is configured.

  If the `Carry over`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set to
  `None. Accrued time reset to 0`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  the `Milestone cap`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field does not
  appear.

- `Carry Over Validity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Tick this
  checkbox to set a time-limit on how long the employee has to use any
  rolled over time off. First, set the second field to the desired
  time-period using the drop-down menu, either `Days`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} or `Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  Next, enter the maximum number of `Days`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} or `Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the
  employee has to use their rolled over time off. After that time period
  passes, any unused rolled over time will expire.

  If the `Carry over`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is set to
  `None. Accrued time reset to 0`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  the `Carry Over Validity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
  does not appear.

Once the form is completed, click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to save the `Create Milestone`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} form, and close the modal, or click
`Save & New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the form and
create another milestone. Add as many milestones as desired.

::: example
This milestone form is configured so the employee earns five days a
year. They start to earn this time yearly, on January 1st.

The employee can never accrue more than 120 days of time off with this
accrual plan. Anytime they have 120 days banked, they will stop accruing
more time off.

Additionally, they can roll over up to 100 days of time off to the next
year, and they have three months to use that rollover time.

Note that due to the `Capped accrued time`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of 120 days, the employee cannot carry over any time
off that exceeds 120 days in total.

### Public holidays {#time_off/public-holidays}

Since holidays vary from country to country, or even city to city, there
are no public holidays preconfigured in Odoo. To observe public or
national holidays, and provide extra days off as holidays to employees,
configure the observed public holidays in Odoo.

It is important to configure public holidays in Odoo, so employees are
aware of the days they have off, and do not request time off on days
that are already set as a public holiday (non-working days).

Additionally, all public holidays configured in the **Time Off** app are
also reflected in any app that uses working schedules, such as
**Calendar**, **Planning**, **Manufacturing**, and more.

Due to Odoo\'s integration with other apps that use working schedules,
it is considered best practice to ensure *all* public holidays are
configured.

#### Create public holidays

To create a public holiday, navigate to
`Time Off app --> Configuration --> Public
Holidays`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. All currently
configured public holidays appear in a default list view.

Click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and a new
line appears at the bottom of the list.

Enter the following information on that new line:

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the name of the
  holiday.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If in a multi-company
  database, the current company populates this field by default. It is
  **not** possible to edit this field.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  The `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is hidden, by
  default. To view this field, click the
  `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(settings adjusts)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
  top-right corner of the list, to the far-right of the column titles,
  and activate the `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  selection from the drop-down menu that appears.
  ::::

- `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the date and
  time picker, select the date and time the holiday starts, then click
  `fa-check`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Apply`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. By default, this field is configured for the current
  date. The start time is set according to the start time for the
  company (according to the
  `working schedules <payroll/working_schedules>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}). If the user\'s computer is set to a different time zone,
  the start time is adjusted accordingly, compared to the company\'s
  time zone.

- `End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the date and time
  picker, select the date and time the holiday ends, then click
  `fa-check`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Apply`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. By default, this field is configured for the current
  date, and the time is set to the end time for the company (according
  to the `working
  schedules <payroll/working_schedules>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}).
  If the user\'s computer is set to a different time zone, the start
  time is adjusted accordingly, compared to the company\'s time zone.

  ::: example
  A company located in San Francisco operates from 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM,
  with an eight hour work day and one hour lunch break.

  For a user in New York, with a computer time zone set to Eastern
  Standard Time, a created public holiday displays a start time of 12:00
  PM - 9:00 PM, accounting for the three hour time zone difference.

  Similarly, a user located in Los Angeles, with a computer time zone
  set to Pacific Standard Time, sees a public holiday time as 9:00 AM -
  6:00 PM.
  :::

- `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the holiday
  should only apply to employees who have a specific set of working
  hours, select the working hours from the drop-down menu. If left
  blank, the holiday applies to all employees.

- `Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If using the
  **Payroll** app, this field defines how the `work
  entries <payroll/work_entries>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} for the
  holiday appear. Select the work entry type from the drop-down menu.

![The list of public holidays in the configuration menu.](time_off/holidays.png)

### Mandatory days

Some companies have special days where specific departments, or the
entire staff, is required to be present, and time off is not allowed on
those specific days.

These types of days are called *mandatory days* in Odoo. These can be
configured to be company-wide, or department specific. When configured,
employees in the specified department or company are unable to submit
time off requests for these mandatory days.

#### Create mandatory days

No mandatory days are configured in Odoo by default. To create a
mandatory day, navigate to
`Time Off app --> Configuration --> Mandatory Days`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
top-left corner, and a blank line appears in the list.

Enter the following information on that new line:

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the name of the
  mandatory day.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If in a multi-company
  database, this field is visible, and the current company populates
  this field, by default. Using the drop-down menu, select the company
  the mandatory day is for.

- `Departments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This column is
  hidden by default. First, click the
  `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
  `(additional options)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the
  top-right corner, next to `Color`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  and then tick the checkbox next to `Departments`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to reveal that column.

  Next, select the desired departments from the drop-down menu. Multiple
  departments can be selected, and there is no limit to the amount of
  departments that can be added.

  If this field is left blank, the mandatory day applies to the entire
  company.

- `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the calendar
  picker, select the date the mandatory day starts.

- `End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the calendar
  picker, select the date the mandatory day ends. If creating a single
  mandatory day, the end date should be the same as the start date.

- `Color`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If desired, select a color
  from the available presented options. If no color is desired, select
  the [No color]{.title-ref} option, represented by a white box with.
  The selected color appears on the main **Time Off** app dashboard, in
  both the calendar and in the legend.

## Overview

To view a color-coded schedule of the user\'s time off, and/or of the
team managed by them, navigate to
`Time Off app --> Overview`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
This presents a calendar with the default filter of [My
Team]{.title-ref}, in a quarterly (three month) view.

To change the time period displayed, click on the
`fa-calendar`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(time period)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to reveal a
drop-down menu. Then, select either `Today`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `This week`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`This month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`This year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or a custom time period,
to present the calendar in that corresponding view.

To navigate forward or backward in time, in the selected increment
(`Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Week`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, etc.), click the `oi-arrow-left`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(left arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`oi-arrow-right`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(right arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons to move
either forward or backward in that specified amount of time. For
example, if `Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, the
arrows adjust the view by one month.

To return to a view containing the current day, click the
`fa-crosshairs`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(Focus
Today)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at any time.

Team members are listed alphabetically on individual lines, and their
requested time off, regardless of the status (*validated* or *to
approve*), is visible on the calendar.

Each employee is color-coded. The employee\'s color is selected at
random, and does *not* correspond to the type of time off they
requested.

The status of the time off is represented by the color detail of the
request, either appearing solid (*validated*) or striped (*to approve*).

The number of days or hours requested is written on the request (if
there is enough space).

At the bottom of the calendar, in the `Total`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} line, a bar graph shows how many people are projected
to be out on any given day. The number on each individual bar represents
the number of employees out for those highlighted days.

Click on a time off entry to view the details for the specific time off
entry. The total number of hours or days are listed, along with the
start and end time of the time off. To view the details of the time off
request in a modal, click the `View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button.

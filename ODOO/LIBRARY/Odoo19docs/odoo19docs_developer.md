# Multi-company Guidelines {#reference/howtos/company}

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

This tutorial requires good knowledge of Odoo. Please refer to the
`../tutorials/server_framework_101`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
tutorial first if needed.
::::

As of version 13.0, a user can be logged in to multiple companies at
once. This allows the user to access information from multiple
companies, but also to create/edit records in a multi-company
environment.

If not managed correctly, it may be the source of a lot of inconsistent
multi-company behaviors. For instance, a user logged in to both
companies A and B could create a sales order in company A and add
products belonging to company B to it. It is only when the user logs out
from company B that access errors will occur for the sales order.

To correctly manage multi-company behaviors, Odoo\'s ORM provides
multiple features:

- `Company-dependent fields <howto/company/company_dependent>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Multi-company consistency <howto/company/check_company>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Default company <howto/company/default_company>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Views <howto/company/views>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
- `Security rules <howto/company/security>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}

## Company-dependent fields {#howto/company/company_dependent}

When a record is available from multiple companies, we must expect that
different values will be assigned to a given field depending on the
company from which the value is set.

For the field of the same record to support several values, it must be
defined with the attribute [company_dependent]{.title-ref} set to
[True]{.title-ref}.

``` python
from odoo import api, fields, models

class Record(models.Model):
    _name = 'record.public'

    info = fields.Text()
    company_info = fields.Text(company_dependent=True)
    display_info = fields.Text(string='Infos', compute='_compute_display_info')

    @api.depends_context('company')
    def _compute_display_info(self):
        for record in self:
            record.display_info = record.info + record.company_info
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The [\_compute_display_info]{.title-ref} method is decorated with
[depends_context(\'company\')]{.title-ref} (see
`~odoo.api.depends_context`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}) to ensure
that the computed field is recomputed depending on the current company
([self.env.company]{.title-ref}).
::::

When a company-dependent field is read, the current company is used to
retrieve its value. In other words, if a user is logged in to companies
A and B with A as the main company and creates a record for company B,
the value of company-dependent fields will be that of company A.

To read the values of company-dependent fields set by another company
than the current one, we need to ensure the company we are using is the
correct one. This can be done with
`~odoo.models.Model.with_company`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}, which
updates the current company.

``` python
# Accessed as the main company (self.env.company)
val = record.company_dependent_field

# Accessed as the desired company (company_B)
val = record.with_company(company_B).company_dependent_field
# record.with_company(company_B).env.company == company_B
```

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Whenever you are computing/creating/\... things that may behave
differently in different companies, you should make sure whatever you
are doing is done in the right company. It doesn\'t cost much to always
use [with_company]{.title-ref} to avoid problems later.

``` python
@api.onchange('field_name')
def _onchange_field_name(self):
 self = self.with_company(self.company_id)
 ...

@api.depends('field_2')
def _compute_field_3(self):
 for record in self:
   record = record.with_company(record.company_id)
   ...
```
::::

## Multi-company consistency {#howto/company/check_company}

When a record is made shareable between several companies by the means
of a [company_id]{.title-ref} field, we must take care that it cannot be
linked to the record of another company through a relational field. For
instance, we do not want to have a sales order and its invoice belonging
to different companies.

To ensure this multi-company consistency, you must:

- Set the class attribute [\_check_company_auto]{.title-ref} to
  [True]{.title-ref}.
- Define relational fields with the attribute
  [check_company]{.title-ref} set to [True]{.title-ref} if their model
  has a [company_id]{.title-ref} field.

On each `~odoo.models.Model.create`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} and
`~odoo.models.Model.write`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}, automatic
checks will be triggered to ensure the multi-company consistency of the
record.

``` python
from odoo import fields, models

class Record(models.Model):
    _name = 'record.shareable'
    _check_company_auto = True

    company_id = fields.Many2one('res.company')
    other_record_id = fields.Many2one('other.record', check_company=True)
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The field [company_id]{.title-ref} must not be defined with
[check_company=True]{.title-ref}.
::::

::: currentmodule
odoo.models
:::

::: automethod
Model.\_check_company
:::

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

The [check_company]{.title-ref} feature performs a strict check! It
means that if a record has no [company_id]{.title-ref} (i.e., the field
is not required), it cannot be linked to a record whose
[company_id]{.title-ref} is set.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When no domain is defined on the field and [check_company]{.title-ref}
is set to [True]{.title-ref}, a default domain is added: [\[\'\|\',
\'(\'company_id\', \'=\', False), (\'company_id\', \'=\',
company_id)\]]{.title-ref}
::::

## Default company {#howto/company/default_company}

When the field [company_id]{.title-ref} is made required on a model, a
good practice is to set a default company. It eases the setup flow for
the user or even guarantees its validity when the company is hidden from
view. Indeed, the company is usually hidden if the user does not have
access to multiple companies (i.e., when the user does not have the
group [base.group_multi_company]{.title-ref}).

``` python
from odoo import api, fields, models

class Record(models.Model):
    _name = 'record.restricted'
    _check_company_auto = True

    company_id = fields.Many2one(
        'res.company', required=True, default=lambda self: self.env.company
    )
    other_record_id = fields.Many2one('other.record', check_company=True)
```

## Views {#howto/company/views}

As stated in `above <howto/company/default_company>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, the company is usually hidden from view if the user does
not have access to multiple companies. This is assessed with the group
[base.group_multi_company]{.title-ref}.

``` xml
<record model="ir.ui.view" id="record_form_view">
    <field name="name">record.restricted.form</field>
    <field name="model">record.restricted</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <form>
            <sheet>
                <group>
                    <group>
                        <field name="company_id" groups="base.group_multi_company"/>
                        <field name="other_record_id"/>
                    </group>
                </group>
            </sheet>
        </form>
    </field>
</record>
```

## Security rules {#howto/company/security}

When working with records shared across companies or restricted to a
single company, we must take care that a user does not have access to
records belonging to other companies.

This is achieved with security rules based on [company_ids]{.title-ref},
which contain the current companies of the user (the companies the user
checked in the multi-company widget).

``` xml
<!-- Shareable Records -->
<record model="ir.rule" id="record_shared_company_rule">
    <field name="name">Shared Record: multi-company</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="model_record_shared"/>
    <field name="global" eval="True"/>
    <field name="domain_force">
        ['|', ('company_id', '=', False), ('company_id', 'in', company_ids)]
    </field>
</record>
```

``` xml
<!-- Company-restricted Records -->
<record model="ir.rule" id="record_restricted_company_rule">
    <field name="name">Restricted Record: multi-company</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="model_record_restricted"/>
    <field name="global" eval="True"/>
    <field name="domain_force">
        [('company_id', 'in', company_ids)]
    </field>
</record>
```

# Connect with a device

IoT Drivers allow any Odoo module to communicate in real-time with any
device connected to the IoT Box. Communication with the IoT Box goes
both ways, so the Odoo client can send commands to and receive
information from any of the supported devices.

To add support for a device, all we need is:

- an [Interface]{.title-ref}, to detect connected devices of a specific
  type
- a [Driver]{.title-ref}, to communicate with an individual device

At each boot, the IoT Box will load all of the Interfaces and Drivers
that can be located on the connected Odoo instance. Each module can
contain an [iot_handlers]{.title-ref} directory that will be copied to
the IoT Box. The structure of this directory is the following

``` text
your_module
├── ...
└── iot_handlers
    ├── drivers
    │   ├── DriverName.py
    │   └── ...
    │
    └── interfaces
        ├── InterfaceName.py
        └── ...
```

## Detect Devices

Devices connected to the IoT Box are detected through
[Interfaces]{.title-ref}. There is an Interface for each supported
connection type (USB, Bluetooth, Video, Printers, Serial, etc.). The
interface maintains a list of detected devices and associates them with
the right Driver.

Supported devices will appear both on the IoT Box Homepage that you can
access through its IP address and in the IoT module of the connected
Odoo instance.

### Interface

The role of the Interface is to maintain a list of devices connected
through a determined connection type. Creating a new interface requires

- Extending the [Interface]{.title-ref} class
- Setting the [connection_type]{.title-ref} class attribute
- Implementing the [get_devices]{.title-ref} method, that should return
  a dictionary containing data about each detected device. This data
  will be given as argument to the constructors and
  [supported]{.title-ref} method of the Drivers.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Setting the [\_loop_delay]{.title-ref} attribute will modify the
interval between calls to [get_devices]{.title-ref}. By default, this
interval is set to 3 seconds.
::::

``` python
from odoo.addons.hw_drivers.interface import Interface

class InterfaceName(Interface):
    connection_type = 'ConnectionType'

    def get_devices(self):
        return {
            'device_identifier_1': {...},
            ...
        }
```

### Driver

Once the interface has retrieved the list of detected devices, it will
loop through all of the Drivers that have the same
[connection_type]{.title-ref} attribute and test their respective
[supported]{.title-ref} method on all detected devices. If the supported
method of a Driver returns [True]{.title-ref}, an instance of this
Driver will be created for the corresponding device.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

[supported]{.title-ref} methods of drivers are given a priority order.
The [supported]{.title-ref} method of a child class will always be
tested before the one of its parent. This priority can be adjusted by
modifying the [priority]{.title-ref} attribute of the Driver.
::::

Creating a new Driver requires:

- Extending [Driver]{.title-ref}
- Setting the [connection_type]{.title-ref} class attribute.
- Setting the [device_type]{.title-ref}, [device_connection]{.title-ref}
  and [device_name]{.title-ref} attributes.
- Defining the [supported]{.title-ref} method

``` python
from odoo.addons.hw_drivers.driver import Driver

class DriverName(Driver):
    connection_type = 'ConnectionType'

    def __init__(self, identifier, device):
        super(NewDriver, self).__init__(identifier, device)
        self.device_type = 'DeviceType'
        self.device_connection = 'DeviceConnection'
        self.device_name = 'DeviceName'

    @classmethod
    def supported(cls, device):
        ...
```

## Communicate With Devices

Once your new device is detected and appears in the IoT module, the next
step is to communicate with it. Since the box only has a local IP
address, it can only be reached from the same local network.
Communication, therefore, needs to happen on the browser-side, in
JavaScript.

The process depends on the direction of the communication: - From the
browser to the box, through [Actions](#actions) - From the box to the
browser, through [Longpolling](#longpolling)

Both channels are accessed from the same JS object, the
[DeviceProxy]{.title-ref}, which is instantiated using the IP of the IoT
Box and the device identifier.

``` javascript
var DeviceProxy = require('iot.DeviceProxy');

var iot_device = new DeviceProxy({
    iot_ip: iot_ip,
    identifier: device_identifier
});
```

### Actions

Actions are used to tell a selected device to execute a specific action,
such as taking a picture, printing a receipt, etc.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It must be noted that no "answer" will be sent by the box on this route,
only the request status. The answer to the action, if any, has to be
retrieved via the longpolling.
::::

An action can be performed on the DeviceProxy Object.

``` javascript
iot_device.action(data);
```

In your driver, define an [action]{.title-ref} method that will be
executed when called from an Odoo module. It takes the data given during
the call as argument.

``` python
def action(self, data):
    ...
```

### Longpolling

When any module in Odoo wants to read data from a specific device, it
creates a listener identified by the IP/domain of the box and the device
identifier and passes it a callback function to be called every time the
device status changes. The callback is called with the new data as
argument.

``` javascript
iot_device.add_listener(this._onValueChange.bind(this));

_onValueChange: function (result) {
    ...
}
```

In the Driver, an event is released by calling the
[device_changed]{.title-ref} function from the
[event_manager]{.title-ref}. All callbacks set on the listener will then
be called with [self.data]{.title-ref} as argument.

``` python
from odoo.addons.hw_drivers.event_manager import event_manager

class DriverName(Driver):
    connection_type = 'ConnectionType'

    def methodName(self):
        self.data = {
            'value': 0.5,
            ...
        }
        event_manager.device_changed(self)
```

# Create customized reports

SQL views are a technique for creating customized reports to show data
that cannot be shown with existing models\' fields and views. In other
words, this technique helps avoid unnecessary creation and calculation
of additional fields solely for data analysis purposes.

## Create a model

A SQL view is created in a similar manner as a standard model:

``` python
from odoo import fields, models


class ModuleReport(models.Model):
    _name = 'module.report'
    _description = "Module Report"
    _rec_name = 'module_field'
    _auto = False
```

Where the attributes:

- [\_auto = False]{.title-ref} indicates that we do not want to store
  the model in the database
- [\_rec_name]{.title-ref} indicates which of the model\'s fields
  represents a record\'s name (i.e. the name that will be used in the
  navigation breadcrumb when opening a record\'s form view)

and its fields are defined in the same way as a standard model, except
every field is marked as [readonly=True]{.title-ref}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Don\'t forget to add your new model to your security file.
::::

## Populate the model

There are 2 ways to populate a SQL view\'s table:

- override the [BaseModel.init()]{.title-ref} method,
- set the [\_table_query]{.title-ref} property.

Regardless of which way is used, a SQL query will be executed to
populate the model. Therefore, any SQL commands can be used to collect
and/or calculate the data needed and you are expected to keep in mind
that you are bypassing the ORM (i.e. it is a good idea to read through
`reference/security`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} if you haven\'t
already). The columns returned from the [SELECT]{.title-ref} will
populate the model\'s fields, so ensure that your column names match
your field names, or use alias names that match.

::::::: tabs
:::: tab
Overriding [BaseModel.init()]{.title-ref}

In most cases, overriding the [BaseModel.init()]{.title-ref} method is
the standard and better option to use. It requires the import of
[tools]{.title-ref} and is typically written as follows:

``` python
def init(self):
    tools.drop_view_if_exists(self.env.cr, self._table)
    self.env.cr.execute("""CREATE or REPLACE VIEW %s as (
                           SELECT
                              %s
                           FROM
                              %s
        )""" % (self._table, self._select(), self._from()))
```

[tools.drop_view_if_exists]{.title-ref} ensures that a conflicting view
is not created when the SQL query is executed. It is standard to
separate the different parts of the query to allow for easier model
extension. Exactly how the query is split up across methods is not
standardized, but at minimum, the [\_select]{.title-ref} and
[\_from]{.title-ref} methods are common, and of course, all these
methods will return strings.

::: seealso
[Example: a SQL view using an override of
BaseModel.init()]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/project/report/project_report.py)
:::
::::

:::: tab
Using [\_table_query]{.title-ref}

The `_table_query` property is used when the view depends on the
context. It is typically written as follows:

``` python
@property
def _table_query(self):
    return 'SELECT %s FROM %s' % (self._select(), self._from())
```

and follows the same [\_select]{.title-ref} and [\_from]{.title-ref}
methods standards as [BaseModel.init()]{.title-ref}.

An example of when the property should be used instead of overriding
[BaseModel.init()]{.title-ref} is in a multi-company and multi-currency
environment where currency related amounts need to be converted using
currency exchange rates when the user switches between companies.

::: seealso
[Example: a SQL view using
\_table_query]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/account/report/account_invoice_report.py)
:::
::::
:::::::

## Use the model

Views and menu items for your SQL views are created and used in the same
way as any other Odoo model. You are all set to start using your SQL
view. Have fun!

## Extra tips

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

A common mistake in SQL views is not considering the duplication of
certain data due to table JOINs. This can lead to miscounting when using
a field\'s [aggregator]{.title-ref} and/or the pivot view. It is best to
test your SQL view with sufficient data to ensure the resulting field
values are as you expect.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If you have a field that you do not want as a measure (i.e., in your
pivot or graph views), add [store=False]{.title-ref} to it, and it will
not show.

# Use Owl components on the portal and website

In this article, you will learn how you can leverage Owl components on
the portal and website.

## Overview

To use Owl components on the website or portal, you will need to do a
few things:

- Create your Owl component and register it in the
  [public_components]{.title-ref} registry
- Add that component to the [web.assets_frontend]{.title-ref} bundle
- Add an [\<owl-component\>]{.title-ref} tag to a website or portal page
  to use the component

## 1. Creating the Owl component

To keep things simple, let\'s start with a very straightforward
component that just renders \"Hello, World!\". This will let us know at
a glance if our setup is working.

First, create the template in
`/your_module/static/src/portal_component/your_component.xml`{.interpreted-text
role="file"}.

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<templates xml:space="preserve">
    <t t-name="your_module.YourComponent">
        Hello, World!
    </t>
</templates>
```

Then create the JavaScript file for that component in
`/your_module/static/src/portal_component/your_component.js`{.interpreted-text
role="file"}, and add it to the [public_components]{.title-ref}
registry:

``` js
import { Component } from "@odoo/owl";
import { registry } from "@web/core/registry"

export class YourComponent extends Component {
    static template = "your_module.YourComponent";
    static props = {};
}

registry.category("public_components").add("your_module.YourComponent", YourComponent);
```

::: seealso
`Owl components reference<frontend/components>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
:::

## 2. Adding your component to the [web.assets_frontend]{.title-ref} bundle

The [web.assets_frontend]{.title-ref} bundle is the assets bundle that
is used by the portal and website, you\'ll want to add your component\'s
code to that bundle so that the public components service can find your
component and mount it. In your module\'s manifest, in the assets
section, add an entry for [web.assets_frontend]{.title-ref} and add your
component\'s files:

``` py
{
    # ...
    'assets': {
        'web.assets_frontend': [
            'your_module/static/src/portal_component/**/*',
        ],
    }
}
```

::: seealso
`Module manifest reference<reference/module/manifest>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
:::

## 3. Adding an [\<owl-component\>]{.title-ref} tag to a page

Now we need add an [\<owl-component\>]{.title-ref} tag that will serve
as the target for the component to be mounted. For the sake of this
example, we\'ll add it directly to the portal\'s home page with an xpath
in `/your_module/views/templates.xml`{.interpreted-text role="file"}.

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo>
    <template id="your_module.portal_my_home" inherit_id="portal.portal_my_home">
        <xpath expr="//*[hasclass('o_portal_my_home')]" position="before">
            <owl-component name="your_module.YourComponent" />
        </xpath>
    </template>
</odoo>
```

Don\'t forget to add this file to the data section of your assets
bundle:

``` py
{
    # ...
    'data': [
        'views/templates.xml',
    ]
}
```

And that\'s it! If you open the home page of the portal you should see
the message \"Hello, World!\" at the top of the page.

## Points of caution

Owl components are rendered entirely in JavaScript by the browser. This
can cause some issues:

- Layout shift
- Poorer indexing by search engines

For these reasons, you should only use Owl components on the portal and
website for specific use cases described below.

### Layout shift

When a page initially renders content, and that content subsequently
moves (\"shifts\") within the page, this is referred to as a layout
shift. When using Owl components in the portal or website, all of the
HTML that surrounds the Owl component is rendered by the server and is
the first thing that will be displayed to the user. When JavaScript
starts running, Owl will mount your component, which will likely cause
the surrounding elements to move around on the page. This can cause poor
user experience: the user sees an element on the page that was initially
rendered and with which they want to interact, so they move their cursor
or finger above that element. Just as they\'re about to click, the Owl
component is mounted, and the element they want to interact with is
moved. They click and interact with the Owl app instead.

This can be a frustrating experience, so you should be careful when
designing your page that the Owl component will not move elements
around. This can be achieved in various ways, e.g. by positioning it
below all other existing elements, not having other interactive elements
around, or reserving a fixed space for the Owl component using CSS.

::: seealso
[Cumulative Layout Shift on web.dev](https://web.dev/articles/cls)
:::

### Poorer indexing by search engines

When search engines build their index of the content of the web, they
use web crawlers to find pages and analyze their content to show these
pages in their search results. While modern search engines are generally
capable of executing JavaScript code and should generally be able to
view and index content rendered in JavaScript, they may not index the
content as fast and penalize the page in search results.

Because most search engines do not reveal the exact way that they crawl
and index web pages, it\'s not always easy to know the extent of the
impact that client-side rendering can have on your search engine scores.
While it\'s unlikely to make or break your SEO strategy, you should
still only use Owl components when they are adding real value over
server-side rendering.

## When to use Owl components on the portal and website

As explained in the previous sections, using Owl component can slightly
degrade user experience if you\'re not careful and may also hinder your
SEO. So when should you choose to use Owl components in these places?
Here are some general guidelines.

### When you don\'t care about SEO

If a page cannot be indexed by search engines because it\'s not
available to the public, e.g. anything in the user portal, SEO
performance is not a concern, as web crawlers cannot access these pages
anyway. There are also some things that you do not want or care about
indexing, e.g. if you want to have a page where the user can choose a
date and time for an appointment, you probably don\'t want search
engines to index the dates on which an appointment is possible at a
specific moment in time.

### When you need strong interactivity

The decision to use Owl is a trade-off between the previously mentioned
disadvantages and the effort that Owl saves you by making it easy to
build richly interactive user experiences. The main reason to use Owl is
when you want to build an interface that can react in real time to user
inputs without requiring the page to reload. If you mainly want to show
static content to the user, you probably shouldn\'t use an Owl
component.

# Create a client action {#howtos/javascript_client_action}

A client action triggers an action that is entirely implemented in the
client side. One of the benefits of using a client action is the ability
to create highly customized interfaces with ease. A client action is
typically defined by an OWL component; we can also use the web framework
and use services, core components, hooks,\...

1.  Create the
    `client action <reference/actions/client>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, don\'t forget to make it accessible.

    ``` xml
    <record model="ir.actions.client" id="my_client_action">
        <field name="name">My Client Action</field>
        <field name="tag">my_module.MyClientAction</field>
    </record>
    ```

2.  Create a component that represents the client action.

    ``` {.js caption=":file:`my_client_action.js`"}
    import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";

    import { Component } from  "@odoo/owl";

    class MyClientAction extends Component {
        static template = "my_module.clientaction";
    }

    // remember the tag name we put in the first step
    registry.category("actions").add("my_module.MyClientAction", MyClientAction);
    ```

    ``` {.xml caption=":file:`my_client_action.xml`"}
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
    <templates xml:space="preserve">
        <t t-name="awesome_tshirt.clientaction">
            Hello world
        </t>
    </templates>
    ```

# Customize a field

## Subclass an existing field component

Let\'s take an example where we want to extends the
[BooleanField]{.title-ref} to create a boolean field displaying
\"Late!\" in red whenever the checkbox is checked.

1.  Create a new widget component extending the desired field component.

    ``` {.javascript caption=":file:`late_order_boolean_field.js`"}
    import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";
    import { BooleanField } from "@web/views/fields/boolean/boolean_field";
    import { Component, xml } from "@odoo/owl";

    class LateOrderBooleanField extends BooleanField {
       static template = "my_module.LateOrderBooleanField";
    }
    ```

2.  Create the field template.

    The component uses a new template with the name
    [my_module.LateOrderBooleanField]{.title-ref}. Create it by
    inheriting the current template of the [BooleanField]{.title-ref}.

    ``` {.xml caption=":file:`late_order_boolean_field.xml`"}
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
    <templates xml:space="preserve">
        <t t-name="my_module.LateOrderBooleanField" t-inherit="web.BooleanField">
            <xpath expr="//CheckBox" position="after">
                  <span t-if="props.value" class="text-danger"> Late! </span>
            </xpath>
        </t>
    </templates>
    ```

3.  Register the component to the fields registry.

    ``` {caption=":file:`late_order_boolean_field.js`"}
    registry.category("fields").add("late_boolean", LateOrderBooleanField);
    ```

4.  Add the widget in the view arch as an attribute of the field.

    ``` xml
    <field name="somefield" widget="late_boolean"/>
    ```

## Create a new field component

Assume that we want to create a field that displays a simple text in
red.

1.  Create a new Owl component representing our new field

    ``` {.js caption=":file:`my_text_field.js`"}
    import { standardFieldProps } from "@web/views/fields/standard_field_props";
    import { Component, xml } from "@odoo/owl";
    import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";

    export class MyTextField extends Component {
       static template = xml`
          <input t-att-id="props.id" class="text-danger" t-att-value="props.value" onChange.bind="onChange" />
       `;
       static props = { ...standardFieldProps };
       static supportedTypes = ["char"];

       /**
       * @param {boolean} newValue
       */
       onChange(newValue) {
          this.props.update(newValue);
       }
    }
    ```

    The imported [standardFieldProps]{.title-ref} contains the standard
    props passed by the [View]{.title-ref} such as the
    [update]{.title-ref} function to update the value, the
    [type]{.title-ref} of the field in the model, the
    [readonly]{.title-ref} boolean, and others.

2.  In the same file, register the component to the fields registry.

    ``` {.js caption=":file:`my_text_field.js`"}
    registry.category("fields").add("my_text_field", MyTextField);
    ```

    This maps the widget name in the arch to its actual component.

3.  Add the widget in the view arch as an attribute of the field.

    ``` xml
    <field name="somefield" widget="my_text_field"/>
    ```

# Customize a view type

## Subclass an existing view

Assume we need to create a custom version of a generic view. For
example, a kanban view with some extra ribbon-like widget on top (to
display some specific custom information). In that case, this can be
done in a few steps:

1.  Extend the kanban controller/renderer/model and register it in the
    view registry.

    ``` {.js caption=":file:`custom_kanban_controller.js`"}
    import { KanbanController } from "@web/views/kanban/kanban_controller";
    import { kanbanView } from "@web/views/kanban/kanban_view";
    import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";

    // the controller usually contains the Layout and the renderer.
    class CustomKanbanController extends KanbanController {
        static template = "my_module.CustomKanbanView";

        // Your logic here, override or insert new methods...
        // if you override setup(), don't forget to call super.setup()
    }

    export const customKanbanView = {
        ...kanbanView, // contains the default Renderer/Controller/Model
        Controller: CustomKanbanController,
    };

    // Register it to the views registry
    registry.category("views").add("custom_kanban", customKanbanView);
    ```

    In our custom kanban, we defined a new template. We can either
    inherit the kanban controller template and add our template pieces
    or we can define a completely new template.

    ``` {.xml caption=":file:`custom_kanban_controller.xml`"}
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
    <templates>
        <t t-name="my_module.CustomKanbanView" t-inherit="web.KanbanView">
            <xpath expr="//Layout" position="before">
                <div>
                    Hello world !
                </div>
            </xpath>
        </t>
    </templates>
    ```

2.  Use the view with the [js_class]{.title-ref} attribute in arch.

    ``` xml
    <kanban js_class="custom_kanban">
        <templates>
            <t t-name="kanban-card">
                <!--Your comment-->
            </t>
        </templates>
    </kanban>
    ```

The possibilities for extending views are endless. While we have only
extended the controller here, you can also extend the renderer to add
new buttons, modify how records are presented, or customize the
dropdown, as well as extend other components such as the model and
[buttonTemplate]{.title-ref}.

## Create a new view from scratch

Creating a new view is an advanced topic. This guide highlight only the
essential steps.

1.  Create the controller.

    > The primary role of a controller is to facilitate the coordination
    > between various components of a view, such as the Renderer, Model,
    > and Layout.

    ``` {.js caption=":file:`beautiful_controller.js`"}
    import { Layout } from "@web/search/layout";
    import { useService } from "@web/core/utils/hooks";
    import { Component, onWillStart, useState} from "@odoo/owl";

    export class BeautifulController extends Component {
        static template = "my_module.View";
        static components = { Layout };

        setup() {
            this.orm = useService("orm");

            // The controller create the model and make it reactive so whenever this.model is
            // accessed and edited then it'll cause a rerendering
            this.model = useState(
                new this.props.Model(
                    this.orm,
                    this.props.resModel,
                    this.props.fields,
                    this.props.archInfo,
                    this.props.domain
                )
            );

            onWillStart(async () => {
                await this.model.load();
            });
        }
    }
    ```

    The template of the Controller displays the control panel with
    Layout and also the renderer.

    ``` {.xml caption=":file:`beautiful_controller.xml`"}
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <templates xml:space="preserve">
        <t t-name="my_module.View">
            <Layout display="props.display" className="'h-100 overflow-auto'">
                <t t-component="props.Renderer" records="model.records" propsYouWant="'Hello world'"/>
            </Layout>
        </t>
    </templates>
    ```

2.  Create the renderer.

    > The primary function of a renderer is to generate a visual
    > representation of data by rendering the view that includes
    > records.

    ``` {.js caption=":file:`beautiful_renderer.js`"}
    import { Component } from "@odoo/owl";
    export class BeautifulRenderer extends Component {
        static template = "my_module.Renderer";
    }
    ```

    ``` {.xml caption=":file:`beautiful_renderer.xml`"}
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <templates xml:space="preserve">
        <t t-name="my_module.Renderer">
            <t t-esc="props.propsYouWant"/>
            <t t-foreach="props.records" t-as="record" t-key="record.id">
                // Show records
            </t>
        </t>
    </templates>
    ```

3.  Create the model.

    The role of the model is to retrieve and manage all the necessary
    data in the view.

    ``` {.js caption=":file:`beautiful_model.js`"}
    import { KeepLast } from "@web/core/utils/concurrency";

    export class BeautifulModel {
        constructor(orm, resModel, fields, archInfo, domain) {
            this.orm = orm;
            this.resModel = resModel;
            // We can access arch information parsed by the beautiful arch parser
            const { fieldFromTheArch } = archInfo;
            this.fieldFromTheArch = fieldFromTheArch;
            this.fields = fields;
            this.domain = domain;
            this.keepLast = new KeepLast();
        }

        async load() {
            // The keeplast protect against concurrency call
            const { length, records } = await this.keepLast.add(
                this.orm.webSearchRead(this.resModel, this.domain, [this.fieldsFromTheArch], {})
            );
            this.records = records;
            this.recordsLength = length;
        }
    }
    ```

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    For advanced cases, instead of creating a model from scratch, it is
    also possible to use [RelationalModel]{.title-ref}, which is used by
    other views.
    ::::

4.  Create the arch parser.

    The role of the arch parser is to parse the arch view so the view
    has access to the information.

    ``` {.js caption=":file:`beautiful_arch_parser.js`"}
    import { XMLParser } from "@web/core/utils/xml";

    export class BeautifulArchParser extends XMLParser {
        parse(arch) {
            const xmlDoc = this.parseXML(arch);
            const fieldFromTheArch = xmlDoc.getAttribute("fieldFromTheArch");
            return {
                fieldFromTheArch,
            };
        }
    }
    ```

5.  Create the view and combine all the pieces together, then register
    the view in the views registry.

    ``` {.js caption=":file:`beautiful_view.js`"}
    import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";
    import { BeautifulController } from "./beautiful_controller";
    import { BeautifulArchParser } from "./beautiful_arch_parser";
    import { BeautifylModel } from "./beautiful_model";
    import { BeautifulRenderer } from "./beautiful_renderer";

    export const beautifulView = {
        type: "beautiful",
        display_name: "Beautiful",
        icon: "fa fa-picture-o", // the icon that will be displayed in the Layout panel
        multiRecord: true,
        Controller: BeautifulController,
        ArchParser: BeautifulArchParser,
        Model: BeautifulModel,
        Renderer: BeautifulRenderer,

        props(genericProps, view) {
            const { ArchParser } = view;
            const { arch } = genericProps;
            const archInfo = new ArchParser().parse(arch);

            return {
                ...genericProps,
                Model: view.Model,
                Renderer: view.Renderer,
                archInfo,
            };
        },
    };

    registry.category("views").add("beautifulView", beautifulView);
    ```

6.  Declare the
    `view <reference/view_records/structure>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} in the arch.

    ``` xml
    ...
    <record id="my_beautiful_view" model="ir.ui.view">
      <field name="name">my_view</field>
      <field name="model">my_model</field>
      <field name="arch" type="xml">
          <beautiful fieldFromTheArch="res.partner"/>
      </field>
    </record>
    ...
    ```

# Write lean easy-to-maintain CSS

There are many ways to lean and simplify SCSS. The first step is to
establish if custom code is needed at all.

Odoo\'s webclient has been designed to be modular, meaning that
(potentially all) classes can be shared across views. Check the code
before creating a new class. Chances are that there is already a class
or an HTML tag doing exactly what you\'re looking for.

On top of that, Odoo relies on
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)
(BS), one of the most complete CSS frameworks available. The framework
has been customized in order to match Odoo\'s design (both community and
enterprise versions), meaning that you can use any BS class directly in
Odoo and achieve a visual result that is consistent with our UI.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

\- The fact that a class achieves the desired visual result doesn\'t
necessarily mean that it\'s the right one for the job. Be aware of
classes triggering JS behaviors, for example. - Be careful about class
semantics. Applying a **button class** to a **title** is not only
semantically wrong, it may also lead to migration issues and visual
inconsistencies.
::::

The following sections describe tips to strip-down SCSS lines **when
custom-code is the only way to go**.

## Browser defaults {#tutorials/scss_tips/browser_defaults}

By default, each browser renders content using a *user agent
stylesheet*. To overcome inconsistencies between browsers, some of these
rules are overridden by [Bootstrap
Reboot](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/content/reboot/).

At this stage all \"browser-specific-decoration\" rules have been
stripped away, but a big chunk of rules defining basic layout
information is maintained (or reinforced by *Reboot* for consistency
reasons).

You can rely on these rules.

::: example
Applying [display: block;]{.title-ref} to a [\<div/\>]{.title-ref} is
normally not necessary.

``` css
div.element {
   display: block;
   /* not needed 99% of the time */
}
```
:::

::: example
In this instance, you may opt to switching the HTML tag rather than
adding a new CSS rule.

``` css
span.element {
   display: block;
   /* replace <span> with <div> instead
      to get 'display: block' by default */
}
```
:::

Here\'s a non-comprehensive list of default rules:

+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Tag / Attribute                   | Defaults                         |
+===================================+==================================+
| [\<div/\>]{.title-ref},           | [display: block]{.title-ref}     |
| [\<section/\>]{.title-ref},       |                                  |
| [\<header/\>]{.title-ref},        |                                  |
| [\<footer/\>]{.title-ref}\...     |                                  |

## HTML tags {#tutorials/scss_tips/html_tags}

It may seem obvious, but the simplest and most **consistent** way of
making text look like a title is to use a header tag
([\<h1\>]{.title-ref}, [\<h2\>]{.title-ref}, \...). Besides reboot
rules, mostly all tags carry decorative styles defined by Odoo.

Besides reducing the amount of code, a modular-design approach (use
classes, tags, mixins\...) keeps the visual result consistent and easily
**maintainable**.

Following the last example, if Odoo titles\' design changes, these
changes will be applied in the [o_module_custom_title]{.title-ref}
element too since it\'s using an [\<h5\>]{.title-ref} tag.

Our framework defines a multitude of utility classes designed to cover
almost all layout/design/interaction needs. The simple fact that a class
already exists justifies its use over custom CSS whenever possible.

Take the example of [position-relative]{.title-ref}.

``` css
position-relative {
   position: relative !important;
}
```

Since a utility-class is defined, any CSS line with the declaration
[position: relative]{.title-ref} is **potentially** redundant.

Odoo relies on the default [Bootstrap
utility-classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/background/)
stack and defines its own using [Bootstrap
API](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/api/).

classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/api/) - [Odoo

:::

### Handling utility-classes verbosity {#tutorials/scss_tips/utility_classes/downside}

The downside of utility-classes is the potential lack of readability.

::: example
``` html
<myComponent t-attf-class="d-flex border px-lg-2 card
{{props.readonly ? 'o_myComponent_disabled' : ''}}
card d-lg-block position-absolute {{props.active ?
'o_myComponent_active' : ''}}  myComponent px-3"/>
```
:::

To overcome the issue you may combine different approaches:

- in Qweb attributes, only use classes to be toggled *on-the-fly*;
- use new lines for each attribute;
- order classes using the convention [\[odoo component\] \[bootstrap
  component\] \[css declaration order\]]{.title-ref}.

::: example
``` html
<myComponent
   t-att-class="{
      o_myComponent_disabled: props.readonly,
      o_myComponent_active: props.active
   }"
   class="myComponent card position-absolute d-flex d-lg-block border px-3 px-lg-2"
/>
```

# Create a standalone Owl application

For any number of reasons, you may want to have a standalone Owl
application that isn\'t a part of the web client. One example in Odoo is
the self-ordering application, that lets customers order food from their
phone. In this chapter we will go into what\'s required to achieve
something like this.

## Overview

To have a standalone Owl app, a few things are required:

- a root component for the application
- an assets bundle that contains the setup code
- a QWeb view that calls the assets bundle
- a controller that renders the view

## 1. Root component

To keep things simple, let\'s start with a very straightforward
component that just renders \"Hello, World!\". This will let us know at
a glance if our setup is working.

First, create the template in
`/your_module/static/src/standalone_app/root.xml`{.interpreted-text
role="file"}.

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<templates xml:space="preserve">
    <t t-name="your_module.Root">
        Hello, World!
    </t>
</templates>
```

Then create the JavaScript file for that component in
`/your_module/static/src/standalone_app/root.js`{.interpreted-text
role="file"}.

``` js
import { Component } from "@odoo/owl";

export class Root extends Component {
    static template = "your_module.Root";
    static props = {};
}
```

It\'s generally a good idea to have the application setup code that
mounts the component in a separate file. Create the JavaScript file that
will mount the app in
`/your_module/static/src/standalone_app/app.js`{.interpreted-text
role="file"}.

``` js
import { whenReady } from "@odoo/owl";
import { mountComponent } from "@web/env";
import { Root } from "./root";

whenReady(() => mountComponent(Root, document.body));
```

The [mountComponent]{.title-ref} utility function will take care of
creating the Owl application and configuring it correctly: it will
create an environment, start the
`services<frontend/services>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, make sure
the app is translated and give the app access to the templates from your
assets bundle, among other things.

::: seealso
`Owl components reference<frontend/components>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
:::

## 2. Creating an assets bundle containing our code

In the manifest of your module, create a new
`assets bundle<reference/assets_bundle>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
It should include the [web.\_assets_core]{.title-ref} bundle, which
contains the Odoo JavaScript framework and the core libraries it needs
(e.g. Owl and luxon), after which you can have a glob that adds all the
files for your application in the bundle.

``` {.py emphasize-lines="9-10"}
{
    # ...
    'assets': {
        'your_module.assets_standalone_app': [
            ('include', 'web._assets_helpers'),
            'web/static/src/scss/pre_variables.scss',
            'web/static/lib/bootstrap/scss/_variables.scss',
            ('include', 'web._assets_bootstrap'),
            ('include', 'web._assets_core'),
            'your_module/static/src/standalone_app/**/*',
        ],
    }
}
```

The other lines are bundles and scss files that are required to make
Bootstrap work. They are mandatory, as the components of the web
framework use bootstrap classes for their styling and layout.

:::: caution
::: title
Caution
:::

Make sure that the files for your standalone app are only added to this
bundle, if you already have a definition for
[web.assets_backend]{.title-ref} or [web.assets_frontend]{.title-ref}
and they have globs, make sure these globs don\'t match the files for
your standalone app, otherwise the startup code for your app will
conflict with the existing startup code in those bundles.
::::

::: seealso
`Module manifest reference<reference/module/manifest>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
:::

## 3. XML view that calls the assets bundle

Now that we have created our assets bundle, we need to create a
`QWeb view <reference/view_architectures/qweb>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} that uses that assets bundle.

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo>
    <template id="your_module.standalone_app">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        <html>
            <head>
                <script type="text/javascript">
                    var odoo = {
                        csrf_token: "<t t-nocache="The csrf token must always be up to date." t-esc="request.csrf_token(None)"/>",
                        debug: "<t t-out="debug"/>",
                        __session_info__: <t t-esc="json.dumps(session_info)"/>,
                    };
                </script>
                <t t-call-assets="your_module.assets_standalone_app" />
            </head>
            <body/>
        </html>
    </template>
</odoo>
```

This template only does two things: it initializes the
[odoo]{.title-ref} global variable, then calls the assets bundle we just
defined. Initializing the [odoo]{.title-ref} global variable is a
necessary step. This variable should be an object that contains the
following:

- The CSRF token, which is required to interact with HTTP controllers in
  many cases.
- The debug value, which is used in many places to add additional
  logging or developer-friendly checks.
- [\_\_session_info\_\_]{.title-ref}, that contains information from the
  server that is always needed and for which we don\'t want to perform
  an additional request. More on this in the next section.

## 4. Controller that renders the view

Now that we have the view, we need to make it accessible to the user.
For that purpose, we will create an
`HTTP controller<reference/controllers>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
that renders that view and returns it to the user.

``` py
from odoo.http import request, route, Controller

class YourController(Controller):
    @route("/your_module/standalone_app", auth="public")
    def standalone_app(self):
        return request.render(
            'your_module.standalone_app',
            {
                'session_info': request.env['ir.http'].get_frontend_session_info(),
            }
        )
```

Notice how we\'re giving the template [session_info]{.title-ref}. We get
it from the [get_frontend_session_info]{.title-ref} method, and it will
end up containing information used by the web framework, such as the
current user\'s ID if they are logged in, the server version, the Odoo
edition, etc.

At this point, if you open the url
[/your_module/standalone_app]{.title-ref} in your brower, you should see
a blank page with the text \"Hello, World!\". At this point, you can
start actually writing the code for your app.

# Translating Modules {#reference/translations}

This section explains how to provide translation abilities to your
module.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If you want to contribute to the translation of Odoo itself, please
refer to the [Odoo Wiki
page](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/wiki/Translations).
::::

## Exporting translatable term

A number of terms in your modules are implicitly translatable. As a
result, even if you haven\'t done any specific work towards translation,
you can export your module\'s translatable terms and may find content to
work with.

::: todo
needs technical features
:::

Translations export is performed via the administration interface by
logging into the backend interface and opening
`Settings --> Translations
--> Import / Export --> Export Translations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}

- leave the language to the default (new language/empty template)
- select the [PO
  File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext#Translating) format
- select your module
- click `Export`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and download the
  file

![image](translations/po-export.png){.align-center width="75.0%"}

This gives you a file called `{yourmodule}.pot`{.interpreted-text
role="file"} which should be moved to the
`{yourmodule}/i18n/`{.interpreted-text role="file"} directory. The file
is a *PO Template* which simply lists translatable strings and from
which actual translations (PO files) can be created. PO files can be
created using
[msginit](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Creating),
with a dedicated translation tool like [POEdit](https://poedit.net/) or
by simply copying the template to a new file called
`{language}.po`{.interpreted-text role="file"}. Translation files should
be put in `{yourmodule}/i18n/`{.interpreted-text role="file"}, next to
`{yourmodule}.pot`{.interpreted-text role="file"}, and will be
automatically loaded by Odoo when the corresponding language is
installed (via
`Settings --> Translations --> Languages`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"})

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

translations for all loaded languages are also installed or updated when
installing or updating a module
::::

## Implicit exports

Odoo automatically exports translatable strings from \"data\"-type
content:

- in non-QWeb views, all text nodes are exported as well as the content
  of the `string`, `help`, `sum`, `confirm` and `placeholder` attributes
- QWeb templates (both server-side and client-side), all text nodes are
  exported except inside `t-translation="off"` blocks, the content of
  the `title`, `alt`, `label` and `placeholder` attributes are also
  exported
- for `~odoo.fields.Field`{.interpreted-text role="class"}, unless their
  model is marked with `_translate = False`:
  - their `string` and `help` attributes are exported
  - if `selection` is present and a list (or tuple), it\'s exported
  - if their `translate` attribute is set to `True`, all of their
    existing values (across all records) are exported

## Explicit exports

When it comes to more \"imperative\" situations in Python code or
Javascript code, Odoo cannot automatically export translatable terms so
they must be marked explicitly for export. This is done by wrapping a
literal string in a function call.

In Python, the wrapping function is
`odoo.api.Environment._`{.interpreted-text role="func"} and
`odoo.tools.translate._`{.interpreted-text role="func"}:

``` python
title = self.env._("Bank Accounts")

# old API for backward-compatibility
from odoo.tools import _
title = _("Bank Accounts")
```

In JavaScript, the wrapping function is generally
`odoo.web._t`{.interpreted-text role="js:func"}:

``` javascript
title = _t("Bank Accounts");
```

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Only literal strings can be marked for exports, not expressions or
variables. For situations where strings are formatted, this means the
format string must be marked, not the formatted string
::::

The lazy version of [\_]{.title-ref} and [\_t]{.title-ref} is the
`odoo.tools.translate.LazyTranslate`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
factory in python and `odoo.web._lt`{.interpreted-text role="js:func"}
in javascript. The translation lookup is executed only at rendering and
can be used to declare translatable properties in class methods of
global variables.

``` python
from odoo.tools import LazyTranslate
_lt = LazyTranslate(__name__)
LAZY_TEXT = _lt("some text")
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Translations of a module are **not** exposed to the front end by default
and thus are not accessible from JavaScript. In order to achieve that,
the module name has to be either prefixed with [website]{.title-ref}
(just like [website_sale]{.title-ref}, [website_event]{.title-ref} etc.)
or explicitly register by implementing
`_get_translation_frontend_modules_name`{.interpreted-text role="func"}
for the [ir.http]{.title-ref} model.

This could look like the following:

    from odoo import models

    class IrHttp(models.AbstractModel):
        _inherit = ['ir.http']

        @classmethod
        def _get_translation_frontend_modules_name(cls):
            modules = super()._get_translation_frontend_modules_name()
            return modules + ['your_module']
::::

### Context

To translate, the translation function needs to know the *language* and
the *module* name. When using `Environment._` the language is known and
you may pass the module name as a parameter, otherwise it\'s extracted
from the caller.

In case of `odoo.tools.translate._`, the language and the module are
extracted from the context. For this, we inspect the caller\'s local
variables. The drawback of this method is that it is error-prone: we try
to find the context variable or `self.env`, however these may not exist
if you use translations outside of model methods; i.e. it does not work
inside regular functions or python comprehensions.

Lazy translations are bound to the module during their creation and the
language is resolved when evaluating using `str()`. Note that you can
also pass a lazy translation to `Environment._` to translate it without
any magic language resolution.

### Variables

**Don\'t** the extract may work but it will not translate the text
correctly:

    _("Scheduled meeting with %s" % invitee.name)

**Do** set the dynamic variables as a parameter of the translation
lookup (this will fallback on source in case of missing placeholder in
the translation):

    _("Scheduled meeting with %s", invitee.name)

### Blocks

**Don\'t** split your translation in several blocks or multiples lines:

    # bad, trailing spaces, blocks out of context
    _("You have ") + len(invoices) + _(" invoices waiting")
    _t("You have ") + invoices.length + _t(" invoices waiting");

    # bad, multiple small translations
    _("Reference of the document that generated ") + \
    _("this sales order request.")

**Do** keep in one block, giving the full context to translators:

    # good, allow to change position of the number in the translation
    _("You have %s invoices waiting") % len(invoices)
    _.str.sprintf(_t("You have %s invoices waiting"), invoices.length);

    # good, full sentence is understandable
    _("Reference of the document that generated " + \
      "this sales order request.")

### Plural

**Don\'t** pluralize terms the English-way:

    msg = _("You have %(count)s invoice", count=invoice_count)
    if invoice_count > 1:
      msg += _("s")

**Do** keep in mind every language has different plural forms:

    if invoice_count > 1:
      msg = _("You have %(count)s invoices", count=invoice_count)
    else:
      msg = _("You have one invoice")

### Read vs Run Time

**Don\'t** invoke translation lookup at server launch:

    ERROR_MESSAGE = {
      # bad, evaluated at server launch with no user language
      'access_error': _('Access Error'),
      'missing_error': _('Missing Record'),
    }

    class Record(models.Model):

      def _raise_error(self, code):
        raise UserError(ERROR_MESSAGE[code])

**Don\'t** invoke translation lookup when the javascript file is read:

    # bad, js _t is evaluated too early
    var core = require('web.core');
    var _t = core._t;
    var map_title = {
        access_error: _t('Access Error'),
        missing_error: _t('Missing Record'),
    };

**Do** use lazy translation lookup method:

    ERROR_MESSAGE = {
      'access_error': _lt('Access Error'),
      'missing_error': _lt('Missing Record'),
    }

    class Record(models.Model):

      def _raise_error(self, code):
        # translation lookup executed at error rendering
        raise UserError(ERROR_MESSAGE[code])

or **do** evaluate dynamically the translatable content:

    # good, evaluated at run time
    def _get_error_message(self):
      return {
        access_error: _('Access Error'),
        missing_error: _('Missing Record'),
      }

**Do** in the case where the translation lookup is done when the JS file
is *read*, use [\_lt]{.title-ref} instead of [\_t]{.title-ref} to
translate the term when it is *used*:

    # good, js _lt is evaluated lazily
    var core = require('web.core');
    var _lt = core._lt;
    var map_title = {
        access_error: _lt('Access Error'),
        missing_error: _lt('Missing Record'),
    };

# Upgrade a customized database

Upgrading to a new version of Odoo can be challenging, especially if the
database you work on contains custom modules. This page intent is to
explain the technical process of upgrading a database with customized
modules. Refer to
`Upgrade documentation </administration/upgrade>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for guidance on how to upgrade a database without customized
modules.

We consider a custom module, any module that extends the standard code
of Odoo and that was not built with the Studio app. Before upgrading
such a module, or before requesting its upgrade, have a look at the
`upgrade-sla`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to make sure who\'s
responsible for it.

While working on what we refer to as the **custom upgrade** of your
database, keep in mind the goals of an upgrade:

1.  Stay supported
2.  Get the latest features
3.  Enjoy the performance improvement
4.  Reduce the technical debt
5.  Benefit from security improvements

With every new version of Odoo, changes are introduced. These changes
can impact modules on which customization have been developed. This is
the reason why upgrading a database that contains custom modules
requires additional steps in order to upgrade the source code.

These are the steps to follow to upgrade customized databases:

1.  `Stop the developments and challenge them <upgrade_custom/stop_developments>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
2.  `Request an upgraded database <upgrade_custom/request_upgrade>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
3.  `Make your module installable on an empty database <upgrade_custom/empty_database>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
4.  `Make your module installable on the upgraded database <upgrade_custom/upgraded_database>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
5.  `Test extensively and do a rehearsal <upgrade_custom/testing_rehearsal>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
6.  `Upgrade the production database <upgrade_custom/production>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

## Step 1: Stop the developments {#upgrade_custom/stop_developments}

Starting an upgrade requires commitment and development resources. If
developments keep being made at the same time, those features will need
to be re-upgraded and tested every time you change them. This is why we
recommend a complete freeze of the codebase when starting the upgrade
process. Needless to say, bug fixing is exempt from this recommendation.

Once you have stopped development, it is a good practice to assess the
developments made and compare them with the features introduced between
your current version and the version you are targeting. Challenge the
developments as much as possible and find functional workarounds.
Removing redundancy between your developments and the standard version
of Odoo will lead to an eased upgrade process and reduce technical debt.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

You can find information on the changes between versions in the [Release
Notes](https:/odoo.com/page/release-notes).
::::

## Step 2: Request an upgraded database {#upgrade_custom/request_upgrade}

Once the developments have stopped for the custom modules and the
implemented features have been challenged to remove redundancy and
unnecessary code, the next step is to request an upgraded test database.
To do so, follow the steps mentioned in
`upgrade-request-test`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, depending on the
hosting type of your database.

The purpose of this stage is not to start working with the custom
modules in the upgraded database, but to make sure the standard upgrade
process works seamlessly, and the test database is delivered properly.
If that\'s not the case, and the upgrade request fails, request the
assistance of Odoo via the [support
page](https://odoo.com/help?stage=migration) by selecting the option
related to testing the upgrade.

## Step 3: Empty database {#upgrade_custom/empty_database}

Before working on an upgraded test database, we recommend to make the
custom developments work on an empty database in the targeted version of
your upgrade. This ensures that the customization is compatible with the
new version of Odoo, allows to analyze how it behaves and interacts with
the new features, and guarantees that they will not cause any issues
when upgrading the database.

Making the custom modules work in an empty database also helps avoid
changes and wrong configurations that might be present in the production
database (like studio customization, customized website pages, email
templates or translations). They are not intrinsically related to the
custom modules and that can raise unwanted issues in this stage of the
upgrade process.

To make custom modules work on an empty database we advise to follow
these steps:

1.  `upgrade_custom/empty_database/modules_installable`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
2.  `upgrade_custom/empty_database/test_fixes`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
3.  `upgrade_custom/empty_database/clean_code`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
4.  `Make standard tests run successfully <upgrade_custom/empty_database/standard_test>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

### Make custom modules installable {#upgrade_custom/empty_database/modules_installable}

The first step is to make the custom modules installable in the new Odoo
version. This means, starting by ensuring there are no tracebacks or
warnings during their installation. For this, install the custom
modules, one by one, in an empty database of the new Odoo version and
fix the tracebacks and warnings that arise from that.

This process will help detect issues during the installation of the
modules. For example:

- Invalid module dependencies.
- Syntax change: assets declaration, OWL updates, attrs.
- References to standard fields, models, views not existing anymore or
  renamed.
- Xpath that moved or were removed from views.
- Methods renamed or removed.
- \...

### Test and fixes {#upgrade_custom/empty_database/test_fixes}

Once there are no more tracebacks when installing the modules, the next
step is to test them. Even if the custom modules are installable on an
empty database, this does not guarantee there are no errors during their
execution. Because of this, we encourage to test thoroughly all the
customization to make sure everything is working as expected.

This process will help detect further issues that are not identified
during the module installation and can only be detected in runtime. For
example, deprecated calls to standard python or OWL functions,
non-existing references to standard fields, etc.

We recommend to test all the customization, especially the following
elements:

- Views
- Email templates
- Reports
- Server actions and automated actions
- Changes in the standard workflows
- Computed fields

We also encourage to write automated tests to save time during the
testing iterations, increase the test coverage, and ensure that the
changes and fixes introduced do not break the existing flows. If there
are tests already implemented in the customization, make sure they are
upgraded to the new Odoo version and run successfully, fixing issues
that might be present.

### Clean the code {#upgrade_custom/empty_database/clean_code}

At this stage of the upgrade process, we also suggest to clean the code
as much as possible. This includes:

- Remove redundant and unnecessary code.
- Remove features that are now part of Odoo standard, as described in
  `upgrade_custom/stop_developments`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
- Clean commented code if it is not needed anymore.
- Refactor the code (functions, fields, views, reports, etc.) if needed.

### Standard tests {#upgrade_custom/empty_database/standard_test}

Once the previous steps are completed, we advise to make sure all
standard tests associated to the dependencies of the custom module pass.
Standard tests ensure the validation of the code logic and prevent data
corruption. They will help you identify bugs or unwanted behavior before
you work on your database.

In case there are standard test failing, we suggest to analyze the
reason for their failure:

- The customization changes the standard workflow: Adapt the standard
  test to your workflow.
- The customization did not take into account a special flow: Adapt your
  customization to ensure it works for all the standard workflows.

## Step 4: Upgraded database {#upgrade_custom/upgraded_database}

Once the custom modules are installable and working properly in an empty
database, it is time to make them work on an
`upgraded database <upgrade-request-test>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

To make sure the custom code is working flawlessly in the new version,
follow these steps:

- `upgrade_custom/upgraded_database/migrate_data`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `upgrade_custom/upgraded_database/test_custom`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}

### Migrate the data {#upgrade_custom/upgraded_database/migrate_data}

During the upgrade of the custom modules, you might have to use
`upgrade scripts
<../reference/upgrades/upgrade_scripts>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
to reflect changes from the source code to their corresponding data.
Together with the upgrade scripts, you can also make use of the
`../reference/upgrades/upgrade_utils`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
its helper functions.

- Any technical data that was renamed during the upgrade of the custom
  code (models, fields, external identifiers) should be renamed using
  upgrade scripts to avoid data loss during the module upgrade. See
  also: `rename_field`{.interpreted-text role="meth"},
  `rename_model`{.interpreted-text role="meth"},
  `rename_xmlid`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}.

- Data from standard models removed from the source code of the newer
  Odoo version and from the database during the standard upgrade process
  might need to be recovered from the old model table if it is still
  present.

  > :::: example

Upgrade scripts can also be used to:

- Ease the processing time of an upgrade. For example, to store the
  value of computed stored fields on models with an excessive number of
  records by using SQL queries.
- Recompute fields in case the computation of their value has changed.
  See also `recompute_fields`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}.
- Uninstall unwanted custom modules. See also
  `remove_module`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}.
- Correct faulty data or wrong configurations.

#### Running and testing upgrade scripts

:::::::: tabs
::: group-tab
Odoo Online

As the instalation of custom modules containing Python files is not
allowed on Odoo Online databases, it is not possible to run upgrade
scripts on this platform.
:::

::: group-tab
Odoo.sh

As explained on the [Odoo.sh]{.title-ref} tab of
`upgrade-request-test`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, Odoo.sh is
integrated with the upgrade platform.

Once the upgrade of a staging branch is on \"Update on commit\" mode,
each time a commit is pushed on the branch, the upgraded backup is
restored and all the custom modules are updated. This update includes
the execution of the upgrade scripts.

When upgrading the production database, the execution of the upgrade
scripts is also part of the update of the custom modules done by the
platform when the upgraded database is restored.
:::

::::: group-tab
On-premise

Once you receive the upgraded dump of the database from the [Upgrade
platform](https://upgrade.odoo.com), deploy the database and update all
the custom modules by invoking the command
`odoo-bin </developer/reference/cli>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} in
the shell. To update the custom modules, use the option: [-u
\<modules\>, \--update \<modules\>]{.title-ref}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

As mentioned in the
`CLI documentation </developer/reference/cli>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, the command used to call the CLI depends on how you
installed Odoo.
::::

### Test the custom modules {#upgrade_custom/upgraded_database/test_custom}

To make sure the custom modules work properly with your data in the
upgraded database, they need to be tested as well. This helps ensure
both the standard and the custom data stored in the database are
consistent and that nothing was lost during the upgrade process.

Things to pay attention to:

- Views not working: During the upgrade, if a view causes issues because
  of its content, it gets disabled. You can find the information on
  disabled views on the Upgrade report. This view needs to be activated
  again (or removed if not useful anymore). To achieve this, we
  recommend the use of upgrade scripts.
- `Module data <../tutorials/define_module_data>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} not updated: Custom records that have the `noupdate` flag
  are not updated when upgrading the module in the new database. For the
  custom data that needs to be updated due to changes in the new
  version, we recommend to use upgrade scripts to do so. See also:
  `update_record_from_xml`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}.

## Step 5: Testing and rehearsal {#upgrade_custom/testing_rehearsal}

When the custom modules are working properly in the upgraded database,
it is crucial to do another round of testing to assess the database
usability and detect any issues that might have gone unnoticed in
previous tests. For further information about testing the upgraded
database, check `upgrade-testing`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

As mentioned in `upgrade-production`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, both
standard upgrade scripts and your database are constantly evolving.
Therefore it is highly recommended to frequently request new upgraded
test databases and ensure that the upgrade process is still successful.

In addition to that, make a full rehearsal of the upgrade process the
day before upgrading the production database to avoid undesired behavior
during the upgrade and to detect any issue that might have occurred with
the migrated data.

## Step 6: Production upgrade {#upgrade_custom/production}

Once you are confident about upgrading your production database, follow
the process described on `upgrade-production`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, depending on the hosting type of your database.

# Animations

Odoo uses eye-catching animations that can bring your website to life.
By default, we can use three kinds of animations:

- Animations on appearance
- Animations on scroll
- Animations on hover

## On appearance {#website_themes/animations/appearance}

In standard, you can add animations to column, text and image elements
when they appear, thanks to the Website Builder. Odoo detects when your
element is in the viewport and launches the animation. A large selection
of animations is available:

- Fade in
- Bounce in
- Rotate in
- Zoom in
- ...

You can easily define an animation on a column in your custom theme. You
need to add two classes: [o_animate]{.title-ref} and
[o_anim_fade_in]{.title-ref}. The second class changes depending on the
type of animation you want to use.

Add the [o_animate_both_scroll]{.title-ref} class to launch the
animation every time the column appears on the screen. The animation is
only launched once by default.

You should also define an [animation-duration]{.title-ref} and an
[animation-delay]{.title-ref} directly in the [style]{.title-ref}
attribute.

Additionally, you can add an animation direction. For instance, to
animate the element from the bottom of the screen, add a
[o_anim_from_bottom]{.title-ref} class and set a
[\--wanim-intensity]{.title-ref} in the [style]{.title-ref} attribute to
control the animation\'s direction intensity.

**Use**

``` xml
<div class="col-lg-6 o_animate o_anim_fade_in o_animate_both_scroll o_anim_from_bottom" style="--wanim-intensity: 100; animation-duration: 2s; animation-delay: 1s;">
    <h2>A Section Subtitle</h2>
    <p>Write one or two paragraphs describing your product or services.</p>
</div>
```

![Animation on appearance options](animations/appearance.png)

## On scroll {#website_themes/animations/scroll}

In the same way as we have seen above, you can add animations on scroll
to column, text and image elements whenever the viewport scrolls through
the animated element.

We can add 6 animation on scroll effects:

- Fade
- Slide
- Bounce
- Rotate
- Zoom Out
- Zoom In

Additionally, we can also set an [in]{.title-ref} or [out]{.title-ref}
effect, an animation [direction]{.title-ref} , the animation
[intensity]{.title-ref} and a [scroll zone]{.title-ref}.

**Use**

``` xml
<div class="col-lg-6 o_animate o_animate_on_scroll o_animate_out o_anim_fade_in o_anim_from_right" data-scroll-zone-start="50" data-scroll-zone-end="100" style="--wanim-intensity: 100;">
    <h2>A Section Subtitle</h2>
    <p>Write one or two paragraphs describing your product or services.</p>
</div>
```

  Start                                                   

  Scroll Zone End  [data-scroll-zone-end]{.title-ref}     Integer

:::

## On hover {#website_themes/animations/hover}

This third kind of animations is only related to images and triggered
every time we hover on the animated image.

We can add 6 animation on hover effects:

- Overlay
- Zoom In
- Zoom Out
- Dolly Zoom
- Outline
- Mirror Blur

**Use**

Enable animations on hover by adding the
[o_animate_on_hover]{.title-ref} class on your image tag. You can also
define the type of animation in the [data-hover-effect]{.title-ref}
attribute.

``` xml
<img
    src="..." alt="..."
    class="img img-fluid o_we_custom_image o_animate_on_hover"
    data-hover-effect="overlay"
    data-hover-effect-color="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)"

# Building blocks

Building blocks, also known as snippets, are how users design and layout
pages. They are important XML elements of your design.

The building blocks are classified into two types:

1.  **Structure blocks**: visually used as \"whole rows\" and
    distributed into multiples categories (`Intro`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, `Columns`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Content`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Images`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `People`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, etc)
2.  **Inner Content blocks**: used inside other building blocks

At the end of this chapter, you will be able to `create custom snippets
<website_themes/building_blocks/custom>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
and to add them into a dedicated category.

## File structure {#website_themes/building_blocks/file_structure}

The layout\'s file structure is the following.

    views
    ├── snippets
    │   └── options.xml
    │   └── s_snippet_name.xml

The styles\' file structure is the following.

    static
    ├── src
    │   └── snippets
    │       └── s_snippet_name
    │           └── 000.js
    │           └── 000.scss
    │           └── 000.xml
    │           └── options.js

## Layout {#website_themes/building_blocks/layout}

Snippets are editable by the user using the Website Builder. Some
Bootstrap classes are important as **they trigger some Website Builder
options**.

### Wrapper {#website_themes/building_blocks/layout/wrapper}

The standard main container of any snippet is a [section]{.title-ref}.
Any section element can be edited like a block of content that you can
move or duplicate.

``` xml
<section class="s_snippet_name" data-name="..." data-snippet="...">
    <!-- Content -->
</section>
```

For inner content snippets, any other HTML tag can be used.

``` xml
<div class="s_snippet_name" data-name="..." data-snippet="...">
    <!-- Content -->
</div>
```

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Attribute      Description
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  class          Unique class name for this snippet

  data-name      Displayed in the right panel as the name of the snippet.
                 If not found, it will fall back to *Block*.

  data-snippet   Used by the system to identify the snippet
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The system automatically adds the [data-name]{.title-ref} and
[data-snippet]{.title-ref} attributes during the drag and drop based on
the template\'s name.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Those attributes should be specifically added when a snippet is declared
on a theme page.
::::

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Avoid adding a [section]{.title-ref} tag inside another
[section]{.title-ref} tag: this will trigger twice the Website
Builder\'s options. You can use inner content snippets instead.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To write the content of a static page with standard snippets, there are
two possible approaches:

- 

  **Pre-build the custom static pages with the Website Builder:** Drag & drop snippets, then

  :   copy/paste the code into your file and clean it up.

|  \*\*OR\*\*

- 

  **Code everything directly:** But beware of compatibility with the Website Builder. It

  :   requires certain classes, names, id, data, etc. to work properly.
      A good practice is to seek out the snippets code created in
      standard code in the Odoo source files. Pay attention that the
      Website Builder sometimes adds classes to the snippets after
      dropped in the page.
::::

### Elements {#website_themes/building_blocks/layout/elements}

There is a list of \"features\" we can enable/disable by using specific
CSS classes.

#### Sizing {#website_themes/building_blocks/layout/elements/sizing}

Any large Bootstrap columns directly descending from a
[.row]{.title-ref} element (respecting Bootstrap structure) will be
triggered by the Website Builder to make them resizable.

``` css
.row > .col-lg-*
```

Add padding on columns and [\<section\>]{.title-ref}.

``` xml
class="pt80 pb80"
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

[pb\*]{.title-ref} and [pt\*]{.title-ref} are the Odoo classes used to
control the handlers. Their values are increased by **multiples of 8**,
till a **max of 256** (0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, \...).
::::

Enable the columns selector.

``` xml
<div class="container s_allow_columns">
```

Disable the columns amount option.

``` xml
<div class="row s_nb_column_fixed">
```

Disable the size option for all child columns.

``` xml
<div class="row s_col_no_resize">
```

Disable the size option for one specific column.

``` xml
<div class="col-lg-* s_col_no_resize">
```

#### Colors {#website_themes/building_blocks/layout/elements/colors}

Add a background based on the color palette for columns and
[\<section\>]{.title-ref}.

``` xml
class="o_cc o_cc*"
```

Disable the background color option for all columns.

``` xml
<div class="row s_col_no_bgcolor">
```

Disable the background color option of one specific column.

``` xml
<div class="col-lg-* s_col_no_bgcolor">
```

Add a black color filter with an opacity of 50%.

``` xml
<section>
    <div class="o_we_bg_filter bg-black-50"/>
    <div class="container">
        <!-- Content -->
    </div>
</section>
```

Add a white color filter with an opacity of 85%.

``` xml
<section>
    <div class="o_we_bg_filter bg-white-85"/>
    <div class="container">
        <!-- Content -->
    </div>
</section>
```

Add a custom color filter.

``` xml
<section>
    <div class="o_we_bg_filter" style="background-color: rgba(39, 110, 114, 0.54) !important;"/>
    <div class="container">
        <!-- Content -->
    </div>
</section>
```

Add a custom gradient filter.

``` xml
<section>
    <div class="o_we_bg_filter" style="background-image: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(255, 204, 51, 0.5) 0%, rgba(226, 51, 255, 0.5) 100%) !important;"/>
    <div class="container">

### Grid layout {#website_themes/building_blocks/layout/grid}

Grid Layout is a powerful and flexible layout system in CSS that enables
users to design complex building block layouts with ease.

#### Use {#website_themes/building_blocks/layout/grid_use}

Enable the Grid Layout by adding the [o_grid_mode]{.title-ref} CSS class
on the [row]{.title-ref}. The number of rows in your grid is defined by
the [data-row-count]{.title-ref} attribute. The grid always contains 12
columns. The grid gap, specified in the [style]{.title-ref} attribute,
determines the gaps (or gutters) between rows and columns.

``` xml
<div class="row o_grid_mode" data-row-count="13" style="gap: 20px 10px">
   <!-- Content -->
</div>
```

#### Items in a grid {#website_themes/building_blocks/layout/grid_items}

Add items in the grid with the [o_grid_item]{.title-ref} class. If the
grid item contains an image, use the [o_grid_item_image]{.title-ref}
class.

``` {.xml emphasize-lines="2,3,4,5,6"}
<div class="row o_grid_mode" data-row-count="13">
   <div class="o_grid_item g-height-* g-col-lg-*" style="grid-area: 2 / 1 / 7 / 8; z-index: 3;">
      <!-- Content -->
   </div>
   <div class="o_grid_item o_grid_item_image g-height-* g-col-lg-*" style="grid-area: 1 / 6 / 9 / 13; z-index: 2;">
      <img src="..." alt="..." >
   </div>
</div>
```

The dimensions and position of a grid item are defined by the grid-area
that can be explicitly set in the [style]{.title-ref} attribute along
with the z-index.

The [g-height-\*]{.title-ref} and [g-col-lg-\*]{.title-ref} classes are
generated by the Website Builder for editing purposes.

#### Grid item padding {#website_themes/building_blocks/layout/grid_items_padding}

``` {.xml emphasize-lines="2"}
<div class="row o_grid_mode" data-row-count="13" style="gap: 20px 10px;">
   <div class="o_grid_item g-height-* g-col-lg-*" style="--grid-item-padding-y: 20px; --grid-item-padding-x: 15px; grid-area: 2 / 1 / 7 / 8; z-index: 3;">
      <!-- Content -->
   </div>
</div>
```

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CSS custom property                    Description
  -------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------
  [\--grid-item-padding-y]{.title-ref}   Vertical paddings (Y axis)

  [\--grid-item-padding-x]{.title-ref}   Horizontal paddings (X axis)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Compatibility system {#website_themes/building_blocks/compatibility}

When a snippet has a [data-vcss]{.title-ref}, [data-vjs]{.title-ref} and/or [data-vxml]{.title-ref} attribute, it means it is an updated

:   version, not the original one.

``` xml
<section class="s_snippet_name" data-vcss="001" data-vxml="001" data-js="001">
    <!-- Content -->
</section>
```

These data attributes indicate to the system which file version to load
for that snippet (e.g., `001.js`{.interpreted-text role="file"},
`002.scss`{.interpreted-text role="file"}).

## Custom snippet {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom}

Some more specific needs will require the creation of custom snippets.
Here is how to create a custom snippet/

### Template {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/template}

Create first the snippet template. Then, add it to the list and make it
available via the Website Builder.

#### 1. Declaration

First, create the template of the custom snippet:

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/views/snippets/s_airproof_snippet.xml``"}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo>

    <template id="s_airproof_snippet" name="...">
        <section class="s_airproof_snippet">
            <!-- Content -->
        </section>
    </template>

</odoo>
```

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

[data-name]{.title-ref} and [data-snippet]{.title-ref} attributes have
to be specified when a snippet is declared on a theme page. Otherwise,
the snippet won\'t be recognised by the Website Builder and issues might
occur whenever a database upgrade is done. Additionally, remember that
the name attribute is shown as the name of your custom snippet in the
`Blocks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the options
panel.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- Use Bootstrap native classes as much as possible. - Prefix all your
custom classes. - Use underscore lowercase notation to name classes,
e.g., [.x_nav]{.title-ref}, [.x_nav_item]{.title-ref}. - Avoid using ID
attribute within your [section]{.title-ref} as several instances of a
snippet may appear throughout the page (An ID attribute has to be unique
on a page).
::::

Add the custom snippet to the list of standard snippets, so the user can
drag and drop it on the page, directly from the edit panel.

#### 2. Group creation

Add a group at the top of the list (feel free to put it where needed in
this list).

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/views/snippets/options.xml``"}
<template id="snippets" inherit_id="website.snippets" name="Airproof - Snippets">
   <!-- Create the group -->
   <xpath expr="//snippets[@id='snippet_groups']/*[1]" position="before">
      <t snippet-group="airproof" t-snippet="website.s_snippet_group" string="Airproof" t-thumbnail="/website_airproof/static/src/img/wbuilder/s_airproof_group_thumbnail.svg"/>
   </xpath>
</template>
```

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Attribute       Description
  --------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  snippet-group   ID of the group

  t-snippet       Inherited template ID

  string          Group name displayed to the users

  t-thumbnail     The path to the thumbnail of the group
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 3. Snippet addition

Then add the custom snippet into the [\<snippets
id=\"snippet_structure\"\>]{.title-ref} which contains all existing ones
on the same level. The Website Builder will split them automatically
into categories by reading the [group]{.title-ref} attribute on the [\<t

#### Inner content snippet

To make a custom snippet appearing in the
`Inner content`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list, add it to the
[snippet_content]{.title-ref} instead:

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/views/snippets/options.xml``"}
<template id="snippets" inherit_id="website.snippets" name="Airproof - Snippets">
   <!-- Add the custom snippet to the group -->
   <xpath expr="//snippets[@id='snippet_content']/*[1]" position="before">
      <t t-snippet="website_airproof.s_airproof_snippet" string="Custom snippet" t-thumbnail="/website_airproof/static/src/img/wbuilder/s_airproof_snippet.svg" />
   </xpath>
</template>
```

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

\- Don\'t forget to add a [t-thumbnail]{.title-ref} and remove the
[group]{.title-ref} attribute as this kind of building blocks is
directly available in the right options panel of the Website Builder. -
Don\'t forget to
`add the snippet to the list of all available "Inner content" snippets
<website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/inner_content>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

### Options {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options}

Options allow users to edit a snippet\'s appearance/behavior using the
Website Builder. You can create snippet options easily and automatically
add them to the Website Builder.

[Standard snippet
options](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/247f28fdec788c7eb7c4288db29b931c73a23757/addons/website/views/snippets/snippets.xml)
:::

#### Template {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/template}

There are a bunch of commands to set the options of a custom snippet.
These options can be created into
`/website_airproof/views/snippets/s_airproof_snippet.xml`{.interpreted-text
role="file"}.

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/views/snippets/s_airproof_snippet.xml``"}
<template id="s_airproof_snippet_options" inherit_id="website.snippet_options" name="Airproof - Snippets Options">
   <xpath expr="." position="inside">
      <!-- Options -->
   </xpath>
</template>
```

Then insert the different available options:

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/views/snippets/s_airproof_snippet.xml``" emphasize-lines="3-16"}
<template id="s_airproof_snippet_options" inherit_id="website.snippet_options" name="Airproof - Snippets Options">
   <xpath expr="." position="inside">
      <div data-selector=".s_airproof_snippet">
         <we-select string="Layout">
            <we-button data-select-class="">Default</we-button>
            <we-button data-select-class="s_airproof_snippet_portrait">Portrait</we-button>
            <we-button data-select-class="s_airproof_snippet_square">Square</we-button>
            <we-button data-select-class="s_airproof_snippet_landscape">Landscape</we-button>
         </we-select>
         <we-title>Space</we-title>
         <we-button-group string="Before">
            <we-button data-select-class="mt-0">1</we-button>

            <we-button data-select-class="mt-5">3</we-button>
         </we-button-group>
      </div>
   </xpath>
</template>
```

::: {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/inner_content}
**Inner content**
:::

Make a custom snippet \"inner content\" (droppable in an other building
block) by extending the [so_content_addition_selector]{.title-ref}
variable which contains all CSS selectors referring to the existing
inner content building blocks:

``` {.xml caption="`/website_airproof/views/snippets/options.xml`"}
<template id="snippet_options" inherit_id="website.snippet_options" name="Airproof - Snippets Options">
   <xpath expr="//t[@t-set='so_content_addition_selector']" position="after">
      <t t-set="so_content_addition_selector"
         t-value="so_content_addition_selector + ', .s_airproof_snippet'" />
   </xpath>
</template>
```

:::

#### Binding {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/binding}

These options use CSS selectors (class, XML tag, id, etc).

##### data-selector {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/binding/data_selector}

Options are wrapped in groups. Groups can have properties that define
how the included options interact with the user interface.

[data-selector]{.title-ref} binds all the options included in the group
to a particular element matching the selector value (CSS class, ID,
etc). The option will appear when the matching selector is selected.

``` xml
<div data-selector="section, h1, .custom_class, #custom_id">
```

It can be used in combination with other attributes like
[data-target]{.title-ref}, [data-exclude]{.title-ref} or
[data-apply-to]{.title-ref}.

##### data-target {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/binding/data_target}

[data-target=\"\"]{.title-ref} allows to apply the option to a child
element of the [data-selector=\"\"]{.title-ref}.

``` xml
<div
   data-selector=".s_airproof_snippet"
   data-target=".row">
```

##### data-exclude {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/binding/data_exclude}

[data-exclude=\"\"]{.title-ref} allows to exclude some particular
selectors from the rule.

``` {.xml caption="The option appears if an `<ul>` tag (without `.navbar-nav` class) is selected"}
<div
   data-selector="ul"
   data-exclude=".navbar-nav">
```

##### data-drop-in {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/binding/data_drop_in}

[data-drop-in]{.title-ref} defines the list of elements where the
snippet can be dropped into.

``` xml
<div data-selector=".s_airproof_snippet" data-drop-in=".x_custom_location">
```

##### data-drop-near {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/binding/data_drop_near}

[data-drop-near]{.title-ref} defines the list of elements where the
snippet can be dropped beside.

``` xml
<div data-selector=".s_airproof_snippet_card" data-drop-near=".card">
```

##### data-js {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/binding/data_js}

[data-js]{.title-ref} binds a custom JavaScript methods.

``` xml
<div data-selector=".s_airproof_snippet" data-js="CustomMethodName">
```

#### Layout & fields {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/layout_fields}

##### [\<we-title\>]{.title-ref} {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/layout_fields/we_title}

Add titles between options to categorize them.

``` xml
<we-title>Option subtitle 1</we-title>
```

![Add a subtitle between custom options](building_blocks/we-title.jpg){width="300px"}

##### [\<we-row\>]{.title-ref} {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/layout_fields/we_row}

Create a row in which elements is displayed next to each other.

``` xml
<we-row string="My option">
   <we-select>...</we-select>
   <we-button-group>...</we-button-group>
</we-row>
```

The perfect example for this case is the `Animation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} row:

![Group different option fields into the same row.](building_blocks/we-row.png)

##### [\<we-button\>]{.title-ref} {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/layout_fields/we_button}

This tag is used inside [\<we-select\>]{.title-ref} and
[\<we-button-group\>]{.title-ref}.

``` {.xml emphasize-lines="2-4"}
<we-button-group string="Before">
   <we-button data-select-class="mt-0">1</we-button>
   <we-button data-select-class="mt-3">2</we-button>
   <we-button data-select-class="mt-5">3</we-button>
</we-button-group>
```

Add [data-select-class=\"\"]{.title-ref} to indicate which class is
added to the targeted element when this choice is selected. Like any XML
node, add other attributes allows to improve the style and/or the user
experience.

``` xml
<we-button
   class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-double-right"
   title="Move to last"
   data-position="last" />
```

![Add option choices and style them with some icons](building_blocks/we-button.jpg){width="300px"}

##### [\<we-select\>]{.title-ref} {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/layout_fields/we_select}

Formats the option as a dropdown list. Add [string=\"\"]{.title-ref} to
indicate the field name.

``` xml
<we-select string="Layout">...</we-select>
```

![Add a dropddown list field](building_blocks/we-select.jpg){width="300px"}

##### [\<we-button-group\>]{.title-ref} {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/layout_fields/we_button_group}

Formats the option as buttons next to each other.

``` xml
<we-button-group string="Before">...</we-button-group>
```

![Add a dropddown list field](building_blocks/we-button-group.jpg){width="300px"}

##### [\<we-checkbox\>]{.title-ref} {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/layout_fields/we_checkbox}

Formats the option as a toggle switch.

``` xml
<we-checkbox
   string="Tooltip"
   data-select-class="s_airproof_snippet_tooltip" />
```

![Add a toggle switch.](building_blocks/we-checkbox.jpg){width="300px"}

##### [\<we-range\>]{.title-ref} {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/layout_fields/we_range}

Formats the option as a slider.

``` xml
<we-range
   string="Images Spacing"
   data-select-class="o_spc-none|o_spc-small|o_spc-medium|o_spc-big" />
```

Each step of the range is separated by a [\|]{.title-ref}. Here, each
class name corresponds to a step.

![Add a toggle switch.](building_blocks/we-range.jpg){width="300px"}

##### [\<we-input\>]{.title-ref} {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/layout_fields/we_input}

Formats the option as a text field.

``` {.xml emphasize-lines="3-5" caption="`data-unit`, `data-save-unit` and `data-step` are optional"}
<we-input
   string="Speed"
   data-unit="s"
   data-save-unit="ms"
   data-step="0.1" />
```

![Add a text field.](building_blocks/we-input.jpg){width="300px"}

[\<we-input\>]{.title-ref} comes with optional attributes particularly
useful in specific case:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Attribute                      Description
  ------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------
  [data-unit]{.title-ref}        Shows the expected unit of measure.

  [data-save-unit]{.title-ref}   Set the unit of measure to which the value
                                 entered by the user is converted and saved.

  [data-step]{.title-ref}        Set the numerical value by which the field can be
                                 incremented.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### [\<we-colorpicker\>]{.title-ref} {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/layout_fields/we_colorpicker}

Formats the option as a color/gradient to choose from.

``` xml
<we-colorpicker
   string="Color filter"
   data-select-style="true"
   data-css-property="background-color"
   data-color-prefix="bg-"
   data-apply-to=".s_map_color_filter" />
```

  [data-apply-to]{.title-ref}       Set the element on which the color is applied.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Methods {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/methods}

Beside *binding options* allowing to select, target or exclude an
element. Option fields have several useful data attributes refering to
standard JavaScript methods.

For example, [data-select-class]{.title-ref} refers to the JavaScript
method named [selectClass]{.title-ref}.

##### Built-in methods {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/methods/builtin}

###### Selection {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/methods/builtin/selection}

There are several built-in methods available. They are callable by using
the related data attribute directly into the XML template.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Data attributes                               Description
  --------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------
  [data-select-class]{.title-ref}               Allows to select one and only one class in the
                                                option classes set and set it on the
                                                associated snippet.

  [data-select-data-attribute]{.title-ref} +    Allows to select a value and set it on the
  [data-attribute-name]{.title-ref}             associated snippet as an attribute. The
                                                attribute name is given by the
                                                [data-attribute-name]{.title-ref} attribute.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### Events {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/methods/builtin/events}

There are also built-in methods directly linked to events the Website
Builder listens to:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Name           Description
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  start          Occurs when the publisher selects the snippet for the
                 first time in an editing session or when the snippet is
                 drag-and-dropped on the page.

  destroy        Occurs after the publisher has saved the page.

  onFocus        Occurs each time the snippet is selected by the user or
                 when the snippet is drag-and-dropped on the page.

  onBlur         Occurs when a snippet loses focus.

  onClone        Occurs just after a snippet is duplicated.

  onRemove       Occurs just before the snippet is removed.

  onBuilt        Occurs just after the snippet is drag-and-dropped on a
                 drop zone. When this event is triggered, the content is
                 already inserted in the page.

  cleanForSave   Occurs before the publisher saves the page.

:::

##### Custom methods {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/options/methods/custom}

To create custom JavaScript methods, a link between the options group
and the custom methods has to be created. To do so, a JavaScript class
has to be created and called in the XML template with
[data-js]{.title-ref}.

Add the [data-js]{.title-ref} attribute to your options group:

``` {.xml emphasize-lines="3"}
<template id="s_airproof_snippet_options" inherit_id="website.snippet_options" name="Airproof - Snippets Options">
   <xpath expr="." position="inside">
      <div data-selector=".s_airproof_snippet" data-js="airproofSnippet">
         // Options
      </div>
   </xpath>
</template>
```

Then, the class can be created in a JavaScript file:

``` {.javascript caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/s_airproof_snippet/options.js``"}
/** @odoo-module */

import options from 'web_editor.snippets.options';

const AirproofSnippet = options.Class.extend({
   // Built-in method example
   start: function() {
      //...
   }
   // Custom method example
   customMethodName: function() {
      //...
   }
});

options.registry.AirproofSnippet = AirproofSnippet;

export default AirproofSnippet;
```

Finally, the custom method can be called on your custom option through
the XML template:

``` {.xml emphasize-lines="3"}
<template id="s_airproof_snippet_options" inherit_id="website.snippet_options" name="Airproof - Snippets Options">
   <xpath expr="." position="inside">
      <div data-selector=".s_airproof_snippet" data-js="airproofSnippet">
         <we-checkbox data-custom-method-name="" />
      </div>
   </xpath>
</template>
```

### Dynamic Content templates {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/dynamic}

By default, Dynamic Content blocks have a selection of templates
available in the Website Builder. Custom templates can also be added to
the list automatically by use the same naming convention for the
template id attribute.

#### Call the template {#website_themes/building_blocks/custom/dynamic/call}

The selected dynamic snippet replace the [\<div
class=\"dynamic_snippet_template\"/\>]{.title-ref} placeholder by the
right template based on the [data-template-key]{.title-ref} and the
custom CSS class:

``` {.xml emphasize-lines="3,4"}
<section
   data-snippet="s_blog_posts"
   data-name="Blog Posts"
   class="s_blog_post_airproof s_dynamic_snippet_blog_posts s_blog_posts_effect_marley s_dynamic pb32 o_cc o_cc2 o_dynamic_empty"
   data-template-key="website_airproof.dynamic_filter_template_blog_post_airproof"
   data-filter-by-blog-id="-1"
   data-number-of-records="3"
   data-number-of-elements="3"
>
   <div class="container o_not_editable">
      <div class="css_non_editable_mode_hidden">
            <div class="missing_option_warning alert alert-info rounded-0 fade show d-none d-print-none">
               Your Dynamic Snippet will be displayed here... This message is displayed because you did not provided both a filter and a template to use.<br/>
            </div>
      </div>
      <div class="dynamic_snippet_template"/>
   </div>
</section>
```

# Forms

Forms in Odoo are very powerful. They are directly integrated with other
applications and can be used for many different purposes.

In this chapter, you will discover how to:

- Add a form in your custom theme.
- Change the action of the form.
- Stylize the form thanks to Bootstrap variables.

## Default form {#website_themes/forms/default_forms }

To add a form to a page, copy and paste the code generated by the
Website Builder in the page.

It should look something like the following.

``` xml
<form
   action="/website/form/" method="post"
   enctype="multipart/form-data"
   class="o_mark_required"
   data-mark="*" data-pre-fill="true"
   data-success-mode="redirect"
   data-success-page="/contactus-thank-you"
   data-model_name="mail.mail">
     <div class="s_website_form_rows row s_col_no_bgcolor">
          <div class="form-group s_website_form_field col-12 s_website_form_dnone" data-name="Field">
               <!-- Form fields -->
           </div>
     </div>
</form>
```

## Actions {#website_themes/forms/actions }

There is a [data-model_name]{.title-ref} in the form tag. It enables you
to define different actions for your form.

Send an email (this action is used by default).

``` xml
<form data-model_name="mail.mail">
```

Apply for a job.

``` xml
<form data-model_name="hr.applicant">
```

Create a customer.

``` xml
<form data-model_name="res.partner">
```

Create a ticket.

``` xml
<form data-model_name="helpdesk.ticket">
```

Create an opportunity.

``` xml
<form data-model_name="crm.lead">
```

Create a task.

``` xml
<form data-model_name="project.task">
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The default action is `Send an E-mail`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} but following the Apps installed on the database, some
other options can be found, such as: Apply for a job, create a customer,
create a ticket, create an opportunity, etc.

Please, note that some of these actions may need specific required
fields in order to be functional. To not forget some requirements, we
highly recommend to preset the form snippet with the Website Builder and
copy/paste the generated source code.
::::

## Success {#website_themes/forms/success }

Define what happens once the form is submitted thanks to the
[data-success-mode]{.title-ref} attribute.

Redirect the user to a page defined in the
[data-success-page]{.title-ref}.

``` xml
<form data-success-mode="redirect" data-success-page="/contactus-thank-you">
```

Show a message (on the same page).

``` xml
<form data-success-mode="message">
```

Add a success message directly under the form tag. Always add the
[d-none]{.title-ref} class to make sure that the success message is
hidden if the form hasn\'t been submitted.

``` xml
<div class="s_website_form_end_message d-none">
     <div class="oe_structure">
          <section class="s_text_block pt64 pb64" data-snippet="s_text_block">
               <div class="container">
                     <h2 class="text-center">This is a success!</h2>
               </div>
          </section>
     </div>
</div>
```

# Going live

Once all the web design and development work finished, it\'s time to
deploy it on a development or production database.

## Module import {#website_themes/going_live/module_import}

### Odoo SaaS {#website_themes/going_live/module_import/saas}

Follow these steps the first time you import a module:

1.  Create a ZIP file of your module.
2.  Connect to the project database.
3.  Enable the `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
4.  Go to `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, search for
    [base_import_module]{.title-ref}, and install it if necessary.
5.  Click on `Import Module`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
    menu.
6.  Upload your ZIP file, tick `Force init`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, and click the `Import App`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} button.

![Import a module on Odoo Online](going_live/screenshot-import-module.png)

If you need to re-import a module after making some changes, follow the
same steps, but before importing the module, open the developer menu and
select `Become Superuser`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To leave
the Superuser mode, log out and log back in.

:::: important

# Gradients

In this chapter, you will discover how to:

- Add a gradient to a section or a title.
- Add a custom gradient to the Website Builder palette.

## Standard {#website_themes/gradients/standard}

In standard, several gradients can be selected directly from the Website
Builder. However, for custom themes, gradients have to be added directly
in the [section]{.title-ref} tag with a [style]{.title-ref} attribute.

**Use**

``` xml
<section class="s_text_image" data-snippet="s_text_image" data-name="Text - Image" style="background-image: linear-gradient(135deg, rgb(255, 204, 51) 0%, rgb(226, 51, 255) 100%) !important;">
    <!-- Content -->
</section>
```

To apply a gradient to text, use a [font]{.title-ref} tag with the
[text-gradient]{.title-ref} class.

``` xml
<h2>
    <font class="text-gradient" style="background-image: linear-gradient(135deg, rgb(203, 94, 238) 0%, rgb(75, 225, 236) 100%);">A Section Subtitle</font>
</h2>
```

## Custom {#website_themes/gradients/custom}

Add a custom gradient to the Website Builder. This way, the user can
easily use them without manually recreating them.

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/gradients.xml``"}
<record id="colorpicker" model="ir.ui.view">
   <field name="key">website_airproof.colorpicker</field>
   <field name="name">Custom Gradients</field>
   <field name="type">qweb</field>
   <field name="inherit_id" ref="web_editor.colorpicker"/>
   <field name="arch" type="xml">
      <xpath expr="//div[@data-name='predefined_gradients']/t[@t-set='gradients']" position="after">
         <t t-set="gradients" t-value="gradients + ['linear-gradient(135deg, rgb(203, 94, 238) 0%, rgb(75, 225, 236) 100%)']" />
      </xpath>
   </field>
</record>
```

# Layout

In this chapter, you will learn how to:

- Create a custom header.
- Create a custom footer.
- Modify a standard template.
- Add a copyright section.
- Improve your website\'s responsiveness.

## Default {#website_themes/layout/default }

An Odoo page combines cross-page and unique elements. Cross-page
elements are the same on every page, while unique elements are only
related to a specific page. By default, a page has two cross-page
elements, the header and the footer, and a unique main element that
contains the specific content of that page.

``` xml
<div id="wrapwrap">
   <header/>
      <main>
         <div id="wrap" class="oe_structure">
            <!-- Page Content -->
         </div>
      </main>
   <footer/>
</div>
```

Any Odoo XML file starts with encoding specifications. After that, you
must write your code inside an [\<odoo\>]{.title-ref} tag.

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<odoo>
   ...
</odoo>
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Using precise template names is important to find information through
all modules quickly. Template names should only contain lowercase
alphanumerics and underscores.

Always add an empty line at the end of your file. This can be done
automatically by configuring your IDE.
::::

## XPath {#website_themes/layout/xpath }

XPath (XML Path Language) is an expression language that enables you to
navigate through elements and attributes in an XML document easily.
XPath is used to extend standard Odoo templates.

A view is coded the following way.

``` xml
<template id="..." inherit_id="..." name="...">
   <!-- Content -->
</template>
```

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Attribute      Description
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  id             ID of the modified view

  inherited_id   ID of the standard view (using the following pattern:
                 [module.template]{.title-ref})

  name           Human-readable name of the modified view
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

For each XPath, you modify two attributes: **expression** and
**position**.

::: {.example caption="``/website_airproof/views/website_templates.xml``"}
.. code-block:: xml

\<template id=\"layout\" inherit_id=\"website.layout\" name=\"Welcome Message\"\>

:   

    \<xpath expr=\"//header\" position=\"before\"\>

    :   \<!\-- Content \--\>

    \</xpath\>

\</template\>

This XPath adds a welcome message right before the page content.
:::

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Be careful when replacing default elements\' attributes. As your theme
extends the default one, your changes will take priority over any future
Odoo update.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- You should update your module every time you create a new template or
record. - *XML IDs* of inheriting views should use the same *ID* as the
original record. It helps to find all inheritance at a glance. As final
*XML IDs* are prefixed by the module that creates them, there is no
overlap.
::::

### Expressions {#website_themes/layout/xpath/expressions }

XPath uses path expressions to select nodes in an XML document.
Selectors are used inside the expression to target the right element.
The most useful ones are listed below.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Descendent     Description
  selectors      
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  /              Selects from the root node.

  //             Selects nodes in the document from the current node that
                 matches the selection no matter where they are.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Attribute selectors         Description
  --------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  \*                          Selects any XML tag. [\*]{.title-ref} can be replaced by
                              a specific tag if the selection needs to be more
                              precise.

  \*\[@id=\"id\"\]            Selects a specific ID.

  \*\[hasclass(\"class\")\]   Selects a specific class.

  \*\[@name=\"name\"\]        Selects a tag with a specific name.

  \*\[@t-call=\"t-call\"\]    Selects a specific t-call.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Position {#website_themes/layout/xpath/position }

The position defines where the code is placed inside the template. The
possible values are listed below:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Position       Description
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  replace        Replaces the targeted node with the XPath content.

  inside         Adds the XPath content inside the targeted node.

  before         Adds the XPath content before the targeted node.

  after          Adds the XPath content after the targeted node.

  attributes     Adds the XPath content inside an attribute.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

::: example
This XPath removes the first element with a [.breadcrumb]{.title-ref}
class.

``` xml
<xpath expr="//*[hasclass('breadcrumb')]" position="replace"/>
```

This XPath adds an extra [\<li\>]{.title-ref} element after the last
child of the [\<ul\>]{.title-ref} element.

``` xml
<xpath expr="//ul" position="inside">
   <li>Last element of the list</li>
</xpath>
```

This XPath adds a [\<div\>]{.title-ref} before the [\<nav\>]{.title-ref}
that is a direct child of the [\<header\>]{.title-ref}.

``` xml
<xpath expr="//header/nav" position="before">
   <div>Some content before the header</div>
</xpath>
```

This XPath removes [x_airproof_header]{.title-ref} in the class
attribute of the header. In this case, you don\'t need to use the
[separator]{.title-ref} attribute.

``` xml
<xpath expr="//header" position="attributes">
   <attribute name="class" remove="x_airproof_header" />
</xpath>
```

This XPath adds [x_airproof_header]{.title-ref} in the class attribute
of the header. You also need to define a [separator]{.title-ref}
attribute to add a space before the class you are adding.

``` xml
<xpath expr="//header" position="attributes">
   <attribute name="class" add="x_airproof_header" separator=" "/>
</xpath>
```

This XPath moves the element with [.o_footer_scrolltop_wrapper]{.title-ref} class before the element with the

:   [footer]{.title-ref} ID attribute.

``` xml
<xpath expr="//div[@id='footer']" position="before">
   <xpath expr="//div[@id='o_footer_scrolltop_wrapper']" position="move" />
</xpath>
```
:::

::::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Using [move]{.title-ref} directives inside an other XPath forces you to
use only this kind of directives.

::: example
\| **Good example:**

``` xml
<xpath expr="//*[hasclass('o_wsale_products_main_row')]" position="before">
<xpath expr="//t[@t-if='opt_wsale_categories_top']" position="move" />
</xpath>
<xpath expr="//*[hasclass('o_wsale_products_main_row')]" position="before">
<div><!-- Content --></div>
</xpath>
```

| **Bad example:**

``` xml
<xpath expr="//*[hasclass('o_wsale_products_main_row')]" position="before">
<xpath expr="//t[@t-if='opt_wsale_categories_top']" position="move" />
<div><!-- Content --></div>
</xpath>
```
:::
:::::

You can find more information about XPath in this [cheat
sheet](https://devhints.io/xpath).
:::

## QWeb {#website_themes/layout/qweb }

QWeb is the primary templating engine used by Odoo. It is an XML
templating engine mainly used to generate HTML fragments and pages.

::: seealso
`QWeb templates documentation <../../reference/frontend/qweb>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
:::

## Custom fields {#website_themes/layout/custom_fields }

Depending on your needs, you can create custom fields to save data in
the database.

### Declaration {#website_themes/layout/custom_fields/declaration }

First, create a record to declare the field. This field has to be linked
to an existing model.

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/fields.xml``"}
<record id="x_post_category" model="ir.model.fields">
   <field name="name">x_post_category</field>
   <field name="field_description">...</field>
   <field name="ttype">html</field>
   <field name="state">manual</field>
   <field name="index">0</field>
   <field name="model_id" ref="website_blog.model_blog_post"/>
</record>
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Fields creation is also possible (and recommended) through [a model
using Python](/developer/tutorials/backend).
::::

### Back-end {#website_themes/layout/custom_fields/backend }

Add the field to the relevant view through an XPath. Therefore, the user
can see the field in the interface and fill it afterwards.

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/views/backend/website_blog_views.xml``"}
<record id="view_blog_post_form_category" model="ir.ui.view">
   <field name="name">view_blog_post_form_category</field>
   <field name="model">blog.post</field>
   <field name="inherit_id" ref="website_blog.view_blog_post_form"/>
   <field name="arch" type="xml">
      <xpath expr="//field[@name='blog_id']" position="before">
         <field name="x_post_category" string="..." placeholder="..."/>
      </xpath>
   </field>
</record>
```

### Front-end {#website_themes/layout/custom_fields/frontend }

The field value can be shown somewhere in a page by calling
[model_name.field_name]{.title-ref} like this:

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/views/website_blog_templates.xml``"}
<h1 t-field="blog_post.x_post_category"/>
```

## Background {#website_themes/layout/background }

You can define a color or an image as the background of your website.

### Colors {#website_themes/layout/background/colors }

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss``"}
$o-color-palettes: map-merge($o-color-palettes,
   (
      'airproof': (
         'o-cc1-bg':                     'o-color-5',
         'o-cc5-bg':                     'o-color-1',
      ),
    )
);
```

### Image/pattern {#website_themes/layout/background/image_pattern }

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss``"}
$o-website-values-palettes: (
   (
      'body-image': '/website_airproof/static/src/img/background-lines.svg',
      'body-image-type': 'image' or 'pattern'
   )
);
```

## Header {#website_themes/layout/header }

By default, the header contains two distinct templates (desktop and
mobile) which display the main navigation, the company\'s logo and other
optional elements (call-to-action, language selector, etc). Depending on
the situation, choose between enabling/disabling existing elements with
a standard template or building a brand new custom template.

### Standard {#website_themes/layout/header/standard }

The Odoo Website Builder distinguishes between desktop templates and the
mobile template in order to facilitate the adaptation of the user
experience according to the device.

#### Desktop template {#website_themes/layout/header/standard/desktop }

Enable one of the header default templates.

::::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Don\'t forget that you may need to disable the active header template
first.

::: example
``` {.xml caption="``/website_aiproof/data/presets.xml``"}
<record id="website.template_header_default" model="ir.ui.view">
   <field name="active" eval="False"/>
</record>
```
:::
:::::

Explicitly set the desired template in the
[primary_variables.scss]{.title-ref} file.

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss``"}
$o-website-values-palettes: (
   (
      'header-template': 'Contact',
   ),
);
```

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/presets.xml``"}
<record id="website.template_header_contact" model="ir.ui.view">
   <field name="active" eval="True"/>
</record>
```

#### Mobile template {#website_themes/layout/header/standard/mobile }

Each header template comes with the [template_header_mobile]{.title-ref}
template ensuring a seamless user experience accross every devices.

::: seealso
[Mobile header template on Odoo\'s Git
repository](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/43b20e6e52526c415e28c21810cd7023f6feef1e/addons/website/views/website_templates.xml#L354)
:::

### Custom {#website_themes/layout/header/custom }

Create your own template and add it to the list.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Don\'t forget that you may need to disable the active header template
first before enabling the custom one.
::::

**Option**

Use the following code to add an option for your new custom header on
the Website Builder.

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/views/website_templates.xml``"}
<template id="template_header_opt" inherit_id="website.snippet_options" name="Header Template - Option">
   <xpath expr="//we-select[@data-variable='header-template']" position="inside">
      <we-button title="airproof"
         data-customize-website-views="website_airproof.header"
         data-customize-website-variable="'airproof'"  data-img="/website_airproof/static/src/img/wbuilder/template_header_opt.svg"/>
   </xpath>
</template>
```

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Attribute                         Description
  --------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  data-customize-website-views      The template to enable

  data-customize-website-variable   The name given to the variable

  data-img                          The thumbnail of the custom template shown in the
                                    templates selection on the Website Builder
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you have to explicitly define that you want to use your custom
template in the Odoo SASS variables.

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss``"}
$o-website-values-palettes: (
   (
      'header-template': 'airproof',
   ),
);
```

**Template**

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/views/website_templates.xml``"}
<template id="header" inherit_id="website.layout" name="Airproof - Header" active="True">
   <xpath expr="//header//nav" position="replace">
      <!-- Static Content -->
      <!-- Components -->
      <!-- Editable areas -->
   </xpath>
</template>
```

Don\'t forget to adapt the [template_header_mobile]{.title-ref}
accordingly to keep consistency between desktop and mobile:

``` {.xml caption="``website_airproof/views/website_templates.xml``"}
<template id="template_header_mobile" inherit_id="website.template_header_mobile" name="Airproof - Template Header Mobile">
   <!-- Xpaths -->
</template>
```

### Components {#website_themes/layout/header/components }

In your custom header, you can call several sub-templates using the
[t-call]{.title-ref} directive from QWeb:

#### Logo {#website_themes/layout/header/components/logo }

``` xml
<t t-call="website.placeholder_header_brand">
   <t t-set="_link_class" t-valuef="..."/>
</t>
```

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Don\'t forget to
`create a record of the website logo <website_themes/media/images/use/logo>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} logo in the database.
::::

#### Menu {#website_themes/layout/headers/components/menu }

``` xml
<t t-foreach="website.menu_id.child_id" t-as="submenu">
   <t t-call="website.submenu">
      <t t-set="item_class" t-valuef="nav-item"/>
      <t t-set="link_class" t-valuef="nav-link"/>
   </t>
</t>
```

#### Sign in {#website_themes/layout/header/components/signin }

``` xml
<t t-call="portal.placeholder_user_sign_in">
   <t t-set="_item_class" t-valuef="nav-item"/>
   <t t-set="_link_class" t-valuef="nav-link"/>
</t>
```

#### User dropdown {#website_themes/layout/header/components/user_dropdown }

</t>
```

::: seealso
You can add a
`header overlay <website_themes/pages/theme_pages/header_overlay>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to position your header over the content of your page. It
has to be done on each page individually.
:::

## Footer {#website_themes/layout/footer }

By default, the footer contains a section with some static content. You
can easily add new elements or create your own template.

### Standard {#website_themes/layout/footer/standard }

Enable one of the default footer templates. Don\'t forget that you may
need to disable the active footer template first.

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/presets.xml``"}
<record id="website.template_footer_links" model="ir.ui.view">
   <field name="active" eval="True"/>
</record>
```

### Custom {#website_themes/layout/footer/custom }

Create your own template and add it to the list. Don\'t forget that you
may need to disable the active footer template first.

**Option**

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/views/website_templates.xml``"}
<template id="template_footer_opt" inherit_id="website.snippet_options" name="Footer Template - Option">
   <xpath expr="//we-select[@data-variable='footer-template']" position="inside">
      <we-button title="airproof"
         data-customize-website-views="website_airproof.footer"
         data-customize-website-variable="'airproof'"
         data-img="/website_airproof/static/src/img/wbuilder/template_footer_opt.svg"/>
   </xpath>
</template>
```

**Declaration**

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss``"}
$o-website-values-palettes: (
   (
      'footer-template': 'airproof',
   ),
);
```

**Template**

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/views/website_templates.xml``"}
<template id="footer" inherit_id="website.layout" name="Airproof - Footer" active="True">
  <xpath expr="//div[@id='footer']" position="replace">
     <div id="footer" class="oe_structure oe_structure_solo" t-ignore="true" t-if="not no_footer">
        <!-- Content -->
     </div>
  </xpath>
</record>
```

## Copyright {#website_themes/layout/copyright }

There is only one template available at the moment for the copyright
bar.

To replace the content or modify its structure, you can add your own
code to the following XPath.

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/views/website_templates.xml``"}
<template id="copyright" inherit_id="website.layout">
   <xpath expr="//div[hasclass('o_footer_copyright')]" position="replace">
      <div class="o_footer_copyright" data-name="Copyright">
         <!-- Content -->
      </div>
   </xpath>
</template>
```

## Drop zone {#website_themes/layout/dropzone }

Instead of defining the complete layout of a page, you can create
building blocks (snippets) and let the user choose where to drag and
drop them, creating the page layout on their own. We call this *modular
design*.

You can define an empty area that the user can fill with snippets.

``` xml
<div id="oe_structure_layout_01" class="oe_structure"/>
```

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Class                      Description
  -------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  oe_structure               Define a drag-and-drop area for the user.

  oe_structure_solo          Only one snippet can be dropped in this area.

  oe_structure_not_nearest   If a building block is dropped outside of a Drop zone
                             having this class, the block will be moved in the
                             nearest Drop Zone.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also populate an existing drop zone with your content.

``` xml
<template id="oe_structure_layout_01" inherit_id="..." name="...">
   <xpath expr="//*[@id='oe_structure_layout_01']" position="replace">
      <div id="oe_structure_layout_01" class="oe_structure oe_structure_solo">
         <!-- Content -->
      </div>
   </xpath>
</template>
```

## Responsive {#website_themes/layout/responsive }

Odoo in general relies on the Bootstrap framework which eases the responsiveness of your website on

:   desktop and mobile. On Odoo 16, you can mainly take action on 3
    aspects:

1.  Automatic computed font sizes depending on the device
2.  Column sizes on desktop (the columns are automatically stacked on
    mobile)
3.  Visibility conditions (Show/Hide something on desktop/mobile)

::: seealso
\- [Bootstrap documentation on display
property](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/display/)
:::

### Font sizes {#website_themes/layout/reponsive/font_sizes }

In Bootstrap 5, responsive font sizes are enabled by default, allowing
text to scale more naturally across device and viewport sizes (relying
on the [\$enable-rfs]{.title-ref} variable).

::: seealso
\- [Bootstrap documentation about responsive font
sizes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/rfs/)
:::

### Column sizes {#website_themes/layout/reponsive/column_sizes }

Bootstrap uses a grid made of rows and columns to layout a page. Thanks
to this structure, columns can be sized differently on mobile and
desktop. In this version, the Website Builder allows to set mobile sizes
([col-12]{.title-ref} for example) and desktop ones
([col-lg-4]{.title-ref} for example) but not the medium breakpoints
([col-md-4]{.title-ref} for example).

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

The medium sizes can be set but the end-user is not able to edit them
within the Website Builder.

::: seealso
\- [Bootstrap documentation on responsive
breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/breakpoints/) -
[Bootstrap documentation about the
grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/)
:::

### Visibility conditions {#website_themes/layout/reponsive/visibility_conditions }

In the Odoo Website Builder, entire sections or specific columns can be hidden on mobile or desktop.

:   This functionality leverages Bootstrap along with Odoo-specific
    classes:

- [o_snippet_mobile_invisible]{.title-ref}
- [o_snippet_desktop_invisible]{.title-ref}

Hide a section on desktop:

``` xml
<section class="s_text_block o_cc o_cc1 o_colored_level pt16 pb16 d-lg-none o_snippet_desktop_invisible" data-snippet="s_text_block" name="Text">
    <!-- Content -->
</section>
```

Hide a column on mobile:

``` xml
<section class="s_text_block o_cc o_cc1 o_colored_level pt16 pb16" data-snippet="s_text_block" name="Text">
   <div class="container s_allow_columns">
      <div class="row">
         <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 d-none d-lg-block o_snippet_mobile_invisible">
            Column 1
         </div>
         <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
            Column 2
         </div>
      </div>
   </div>
</section>
```

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Class                         Description
  ----------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  o_snippet_mobile_invisible    It tells the Website Builder that the element is hidden
                                and is using visibility conditions option.

  o_snippet_desktop_invisible   It tells the Website Builder that the element is hidden
                                **on desktop and** is using visibility conditions
                                option.

  d-none                        Hide the element in every situations.

  d-lg-block                    Show the element from the \"large\" breakpoint (on
                                desktop).
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

[o_snippet_mobile_invisible]{.title-ref} /
[o_snippet_desktop_invisible]{.title-ref} classes have to be specified
to keep the visibility conditions option functional. Even if an element
is hidden on desktop, the Website Builder displays a list of these
elements allowing the end-user to force show the element and edit it
without switching between mobile and desktop mode.

# Media

In this chapter we will see how to include media elements such as
images, videos or icons within Odoo.

## Images {#website_themes/media/images}

Record images in the database and use them later in your design/code.
They will also be available for the end user through the *media dialog*.

![Media window](media/media-window.png)

The Website Builder supports the following image file formats: JPG, GIF,
PNG, and SVG.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Some options offered by the Website Builder are only applicable to media
registered into a record. You might not see some options if you add an
image directly with a relative path to your module folder.
::::

### Declaration {#website_themes/media/images/declaration}

To use your images in your code and have them included in the builder\'s
gallery (so the client can reuse them), declare them like this:

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/images.xml``"}
<record id="img_about_01" model="ir.attachment">
    <field name="name">About Image 01</field>
    <field name="datas" type="base64" file="website_airproof/static/src/img/content/img_about_01.jpg"/>
    <field name="res_model">ir.ui.view</field>
    <field name="public" eval="True"/>
</record>
```

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Field          Description
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  id             The name of your image to be used in your code

  name           A descriptive name for your image

  datas          The location of your image
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Use {#website_themes/media/images/use}

#### Regular images {#website_themes/media/images/use/regular}

In your xml templates, call your images as follows:

``` xml
<img src="/web/image/website_airproof.img_about_01" alt=""/>
```

Being [img_about_01]{.title-ref} the id you gave to your image.

#### Background images {#website_themes/media/images/use/background}

``` xml
<section style="background-image: url('/web/image/website_airproof.img_about_01');">
```

#### Company logo {#website_themes/media/images/use/logo}

For the company logo, the use is a little bit different. First declare
it within the [website.xml]{.title-ref} file and then call it using the
right template. For instance, to call inside the header, we will use
[\<t t-call=\"website.placeholder_header_brand\"\>]{.title-ref}.

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/images.xml``"}
<record id="website.default_website" model="website">
    <field name="logo" type="base64" file="website_airproof/static/src/img/content/logo.png"/>
</record>
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`Here <theming/module/website>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} you can
find more information about the company logo setup and global website
settings presets.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To make sure that your images don\'t slow down your web page and don\'t
weigh too much, try to respect these few points:

- **Weight**: \< 200Kb.
- **Size**: not more than 1500px if not needed.
- **Extension**: use svg or jpg, png or gif.
- **Name**: no spaces, accents or special characters and separate words
  with dashes. Use relevant words whenever possible.
- Images larger than 1920px will be heavily compressed by the website
  builder. If \< 1920px, they will remain intact.
::::

## Videos {#website_themes/media/videos}

Add videos as background.

``` xml
<section class="o_background_video" data-bg-video-src="...">
    <!-- Content -->
</section>
```

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Attribute           Description
  ------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  data-bg-video-src   Video URL.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add videos as content.

``` xml
<div class="media_iframe_video" data-oe-expression="...">
    <div class="css_editable_mode_display" />
    <div class="media_iframe_video_size" contenteditable="false" />
    <iframe src="..."
        frameborder="0"
        contenteditable="false"
        allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"/>
</div>
```

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Attribute            Description
  -------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  data-oe-expression   Video URL.

  src                  Video URL.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Icons {#website_themes/media/icons}

By default, the Font Awesome icons library is included in the Website
Builder. You can place icons anywhere using the CSS Prefix
[fa]{.title-ref} and the icon\'s name. Font Awesome is designed to be
used with inline elements. You can use [\<i\>]{.title-ref} tag for
brevity, but using a [\<span\>]{.title-ref} is more semantically
correct.

``` xml
<span class="fa fa-picture-o"/>
```

::: seealso
[Font Awesome v4 icons](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/)
:::

Enable the Website Builder style options.

``` xml
<span class="fa fa-2x fa-picture-o rounded-circle"/>
```

Increase the icon size (fa-2x, fa-3x, fa-4x, or fa-5x classes).

``` xml
<span class="fa fa-2x fa-picture-o"/>
```

# Navigation

You can easily modify the navigation with the Website Builder to fit
your needs.

In this chapter, you will learn how to:

- Delete and create menu items.
- Create a dropdown menu.
- Create a mega menu.

## Default {#website_themes/navigation/default}

Odoo automatically generates some basic menu items depending on the apps
you installed. For example, the Website app adds two items to the main
menu. These items are linked to pages, which are also automatically
created.

Delete default menu items.

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/menu.xml``"}
<!-- Contact us -->
<delete model="website.menu" search="[('url','in', ['/', '/contactus']),
('website_id', '=', 1)]"/>

<!-- Shop -->
<delete model="website.menu" search="[('url','in', ['/', '/shop']),
('website_id', '=', 1)]"/>
```

## Menu item {#website_themes/navigation/menu}

**Declaration**

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/menu.xml``"}
<record id="menu_about_us" model="website.menu">
    <field name="name">About us</field>
    <field name="url">/about-us</field>
    <field name="parent_id" search="[
        ('url', '=', '/default-main-menu'),
        ('website_id', '=', 1)]"/>
    <field name="website_id">1</field>
    <field name="sequence" type="int">10</field>
</record>
```

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Field          Description
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  name           Link text

  url            Value of the href attribute

  parent_id      The menu in which the item will be added.

  website_id     The website on which the item will be added.

  sequence       Defines the link\'s position in the top menu.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### New window {#website_themes/navigation/menu/new_window}

Open the link\'s URL in a new tab.

``` xml
<record id="..." model="website.menu">
    <field name="new_window" eval="True"/>
</record>
```

### External Links {#website_themes/navigation/menu/external_links}

Add a link to an external website.

``` xml
<record id="..." model="website.menu">
    <field name="url">https://www.odoo.com</field>
</record>
```

### Anchor {#website_themes/navigation/menu/anchor}

Link to a specific section of a page.

``` xml
<record id="..." model="website.menu">
    <field name="url">/about-us#our-team</field>
</record>
```

## Dropdown menu {#website_themes/navigation/dropdown}

**Declaration**

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/menu.xml``"}
<record id="menu_services" model="website.menu">
    <field name="name">Services</field>
    <field name="website_id">1</field>
    <field name="parent_id" search="[
        ('url', '=', '/default-main-menu'),
        ('website_id', '=', 1)]"/>
    <field name="sequence" type="int">...</field>
</record>
```

Add an item to a dropdown menu.

``` xml
<record id="menu_services_item_1" model="website.menu">
    <field name="name">Item 1</field>
    <field name="url">/dropdown/item-1</field>
    <field name="website_id">1</field>
    <field name="parent_id" ref="website_airproof.menu_services"/>
    <field name="sequence" type="int">...</field>
</record>
```

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Field          Description
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  parent_id      The dropdown in which the item will be added.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Mega menu {#website_themes/navigation/mega_menu}

A mega menu is a dropdown menu with additional possibilities and not
just a list of links. In a mega menu, you can use any kind of content
(text, images, icons, \...).

In Odoo, you can select a mega-menu template in the list. If you don\'t
need a custom layout, you can re-use the template structure in the
[mega_menu_content]{.title-ref} field like any static content.

**Declaration**

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/menu.xml``"}
<record id="menu_mega_menu" model="website.menu">
    <field name="name">Mega Menu</field>
    <field name="parent_id" search="[
        ('url', '=', '/default-main-menu'),
        ('website_id', '=', 1)]"/>
    <field name="website_id">1</field>
    <field name="sequence" type="int">..</field>
    <field name="is_mega_menu" eval="True"/>
    <field name="mega_menu_classes">...</field>
    <field name="mega_menu_content" type="html">

  mega_menu_classes   Custom classes to be added to the main element

  mega_menu_content   The default content of the mega menu
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beside that, you might need to create something more visually advanced
with a custom template. Feel free to check how the [standard
templates]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/website/views/snippets/s_mega_menu_odoo_menu.xml)
are built in the Odoo source code.

### Custom template {#website_themes/navigation/mega_menu/custom}

Create your own template and add it to the list.

**Layout**

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/views/website_templates.xml``"}
<template id="s_mega_menu_airproof" name="Airproof" groups="base.group_user">
    <section class="s_mega_menu_airproof o_cc o_cc1 pt40">
        <!-- Content -->
    </section>
</template>
```

**Option**

Use the following code to add an option for your new custom mega menu on
the Website Builder.

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/views/snippets/options.xml``"}
<template id="snippet_options" inherit_id="website.snippet_options" name="Airproof - Mega Menu Options">
    <xpath expr="//*[@data-name='mega_menu_template_opt']/*" position="before">
        <t t-set="_label">Airproof</t>
        <we-button t-att-data-select-label="_label"
            data-select-template="website_airproof.s_mega_menu_airproof"
            data-img="/website_airproof/static/src/img/builder/header_opt.svg"
            t-out="_label"/>
    </xpath>

# Pages

In this chapter, you will learn how to declare static pages.

## Default pages {#website_themes/pages/default }

In Odoo, websites come with a few default static pages (Home, Contact
us, 404, \...). They are built the following way.

``` {.xml caption="`/website/data/website_data.xml`"}
<template id="website.homepage" name="Home">
   <t t-call="website.layout">
      <t t-set="pageName" t-value="'homepage'"/>
      <div id="wrap" class="oe_structure oe_empty" />
   </t>
</template>
```

Each default page is a template with its own content saved into a
record. This is the reason why,
`custom pages are created within a record <website_themes/pages/theme_pages>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

The [\<t-call=\'website.layout\'\>]{.title-ref} has some variables that
can be set:

Define the meta title.

``` xml
<t t-set="additional_title">My Page Title</t>
```

::::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The [t-set]{.title-ref} here does not pass the value into a
[t-value]{.title-ref} or a [t-valuef]{.title-ref} attribute. This is for
translation purpose. The content of a [t-value]{.title-ref} or a
[t-valuef]{.title-ref} is not explicitly exported for translation.
Beside that, as it\'s written in XML, a string located between an
opening and a closing tag is considered translatable by default.

::: example
**Good example:**

``` xml
<t t-set="additional_title">My title</t>
```

**Bad example:**

``` xml
<t t-set="additional_title" t-valuef="My title"/>
```
:::
:::::

Define the meta description.

``` xml
<t t-set="meta_description">This is the description of the page that will appear on Search
Engines.</t>
```

Add a CSS class to the page.

``` xml
<t t-set="pageName" t-valuef="..."/>
```

Hide the header.

``` xml
<t t-set="no_header" t-value="true"/>
```

Hide the footer.

``` xml
<t t-set="no_footer" t-value="true"/>
```

If needed, deactivate default pages.

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/pages/home.xml``"}
<record id="website.homepage" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="active" eval="False"/>
</record>
```

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/pages/contactus.xml``"}
<record id="website.contactus" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="active" eval="False"/>
</record>
```

Alternatively, replace the default content of these pages using XPath.

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/pages/404.xml``"}
<template id="404" inherit_id="http_routing.404">
    <xpath expr="//*[@id='wrap']" position="replace">
        <t t-set="additional_title" t-value="'404 - Not found'"/>

        <div id="wrap" class="oe_structure">
            <!-- Content -->
        </div>
    </xpath>
</template>
```

:::

## Theme pages {#website_themes/pages/theme_pages }

You can add as many pages as you want to your website. Instead of
defining a [\<template\>]{.title-ref}, create a page object.

**Declaration**

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/pages/about_us.xml``"}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo noupdate="1">
   <record id="page_about_us" model="website.page">
      <field name="name">About us</field>
      <field name="is_published" eval="True"/>
      <field name="key">website_airproof.page_about_us</field>
      <field name="url">/about-us</field>
      <field name="website_id" eval="1" />
      <field name="type">qweb</field>
      <field name="arch" type="xml">
         <t t-name="website_airproof.page_about_us">
            <t t-call="website.layout">
               <div id="wrap" class="oe_structure">
                  <!-- Content -->
               </div>
            </t>
         </t>
      </field>
   </record>
</odoo>
```

::: admonition
Multiwebsite and [website_id]{.title-ref}

In a module context, the record created above is available, by default,
on every website available on the database. It\'s preferable to specify
the [website_id]{.title-ref} of the website where the page will be
findable.
:::

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Field          Description
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  name           Page name (human-readable).

  is_published   Define if the page is published (visible to visitors).

  key            View key (must be unique)

  url            Relative path where the page is reachable.

  type           View type

  arch           View architecture (the markup of your page)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

With [\<t t-call=\"website.layout\"\>]{.title-ref} you use the Odoo
default page layout with your code.

### [noupdate]{.title-ref} attribute {#website_themes/pages/theme_pages/noupdate }

This attribute prevents data overwriting. It can be added either on a
[data]{.title-ref} tag wrapping some records to protect or on the
[odoo\`tag]{.title-ref} in order to protect all records declared into
the file.

Protect all records of the file:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo noupdate="1">
   <record id="menu_company" model="website.menu">
      <!-- Fields -->
   </record>
   <record id="menu_faq" model="website.menu">
      <!-- Fields -->
   </record>
</odoo>
```

Protect specific records in the file:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo>
   <record id="menu_company" model="website.menu">
      <!-- Fields -->
   </record>

   <data noupdate="1">
      <record id="menu_faq" model="website.menu">
         <!-- Fields -->
      </record>
      <record id="menu_legal" model="website.menu">
         <!-- Fields -->
      </record>
   </data>
</odoo>
```

**Use case**

There are several static pages created in the module. This one has been
installed on the database and the end-user has updated some of those
pages. Some bug fixes must be applied on the static pages while avoiding
any loss of changes made by the end-user.

**Problem**

In case of a module update on the database, every record declared into
the module will overwrite those existing in the database even if the
end-user has changed some of these records.

**Solution**

By wrapping the record (or all records declared in the file) into a
[\<data noupdate=\"1\"\>\</data\>]{.title-ref} tag, the record declared
is created at the first module installation but not updated after a
module update.

::: spoiler
What happens if the record has been manually deleted (e.g.: a menu item)
?

The system detects that this record doesn\'t exist and will re-create
it.
:::

::: spoiler
Is this method only valid on static page records?

Of course not. It\'s technically usable for every type of records.
:::

### Header overlay {#website_themes/pages/theme_pages/header_overlay }

Make the header background transparent and stand on top of the page
content.

``` xml
<field name="header_overlay" eval="True"/>
```

![Header overlay](pages/header-overlay.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To create the content of a static page, use the Odoo way of doing things
in order to remain editable by the Website Builder. Please note that
Odoo takes advantage of Bootstrap framework (5.1.3).

Find the available classes and components:

- [Bootstrap cheat
  sheet](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/cheatsheet/)
- [Bootstrap
  documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)
::::

### Page templates {#website_themes/pages/theme_pages/page_templates }

Create preset static page templates available from the New Page dialog
window.

**Declaration**

The page templates has to be defined into the
`__manifest__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"} of the module through
[new_page_templates]{.title-ref} and
`new_page_template_templates.xml`{.interpreted-text role="file"}:

``` {.python caption="`/website_airproof/__manifest__.py`" emphasize-lines="11,16-19"}
{
   'name': 'Airproof Theme',
   'description': '...',
   'category': 'Website/Theme',
   'version': '{BRANCH}.0.0',
   'author': '...',
   'license': '...',
   'depends': ['website'],
   'data': [
      # ...
      'views/new_page_template_templates.xml'
   ],
   'assets': {
      # ...
   },
   'new_page_templates': {
      'airproof': {
         'faq': ['s_airproof_text_block_h1', 's_title', 's_faq_collapse', 's_call_to_action']
   }
}
```

**Templates**

Then you have to create the template using a specific naming convention
based on the hierarchy into the `__manifest__.py`{.interpreted-text
role="file"}. In this case, the name is
[new_page_template_sections_airproof_faq]{.title-ref}. The building
blocks called in this template are exactly the same as the standard ones
except for the first that has been adapted \"on the fly\".

Create a new instance of the standard [s_text_block]{.title-ref}
([primary]{.title-ref} attribute is important) and apply some
adaptations:

``` {.xml caption="`/website_airproof/views/new_page_template_templates.xml`"}
<template id="s_airproof_text_block_h1" inherit_id="website.s_text_block" primary="True">
   <xpath expr="//div[hasclass('container')]|//div[hasclass('o_container_small')]" position="replace">
      <div class="container s_allow_columns">
            <h1 class="display-1">FAQ - Help</h1>
      </div>
   </xpath>
</template>
```

Instantiate each building block (modified or not) for the page template:

``` {.xml caption="`/website_airproof/views/new_page_template_templates.xml`"}
<template id="new_page_template_airproof_faq_s_text_block_h1" inherit_id="website_airproof.s_airproof_text_block_h1" primary="True"/>
<template id="new_page_template_airproof_faq_s_title" inherit_id="website.s_title" primary="True"/>
<template id="new_page_template_airproof_faq_s_faq_collapse" inherit_id="website.s_faq_collapse" primary="True"/>
<template id="new_page_template_airproof_faq_s_call_to_action" inherit_id="website.s_call_to_action" primary="True"/>
```

Then, create your page template with some [t-snippet-call]{.title-ref}
within an [#wrap]{.title-ref} as explained above:

``` {.xml caption="`/website_airproof/views/new_page_template_templates.xml`"}
<template id="new_page_template_sections_airproof_faq" name="Airproof - New Page Template FAQ">
   <div id="wrap">
      <t t-snippet-call="website_airproof.new_page_template_airproof_faq_s_text_block_h1"/>
      <t t-snippet-call="website_airproof.new_page_template_airproof_faq_s_title"/>
      <t t-snippet-call="website_airproof.new_page_template_airproof_faq_s_faq_collapse"/>
      <t t-snippet-call="website_airproof.new_page_template_airproof_faq_s_call_to_action"/>
   </div>
</template>
```

Once the page template is created, create a custom group and add it to
the existing ones. Find below a list of the existing groups:

``` {.xml caption="`/website/views/new_page_template_templates.xml`"}
<template id="new_page_template_groups">
   <div id="basic">Basic</div>
   <div id="about">About</div>
   <div id="landing">Landing Pages</div>
   <div id="gallery">Gallery</div>
   <div id="services">Services</div>
   <div id="pricing">Pricing Plans</div>
   <div id="team">Team</div>
</template>
```

Feel free to add custom groups to the list:

``` {.xml caption="`/website_airproof/views/new_page_template_templates.xml`"}
<template id="new_page_template_groups" inherit_id="website.new_page_template_groups" name="Airproof - New Page Template Groups">
   <xpath expr="//div[@id='custom']" position="after">
      <div id="airproof">Airproof</div>
   </xpath>
</template>
```

# Setup

In this chapter, you will learn:

- To set up your local development environment.
- The outline of the Odoo database structure.
- To export and import an Odoo database in your local environment.
- To have an Odoo instance up and running.

## Install {#website_themes/setup/install }

There are multiple ways to
`install Odoo </administration/on_premise>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, depending on the intended use case. This documentation
assumes you use the `source install
</administration/on_premise/source>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
(running Odoo from the source code), which is best suited for Odoo
designers and developers.

## Databases {#website_themes/setup/databases }

### Structure {#website_themes/setup/databases/structure }

Every Odoo application works similarly; they are built with the same
logic. A model contains fields and relational fields that link to other
models. Each model has views representing all its fields, with backend
and frontend views.

#### Models {#website_themes/setup/databases/models }

The basis of Odoo is models. Models use fields to record the data.
Records are stored in a database: they are therefore linked to a model.
In Odoo, you can find the different models in the backend by enabling
the `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
then going to
`Settings --> Technical --> Database Structure: Models`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![Models page](setup/models-page.png)

#### Fields {#website_themes/setup/databases/fields }

In a model, we will centralize fields (field names we need to target in
our code).

::: seealso
`/applications/studio/fields`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

##### Classic fields {#website_themes/setup/databases/fields/classic }

- Date
- Char
- Selection
- ...

##### Relational fields {#website_themes/setup/databases/fields/relational }

Relational fields call a field from another model. They allow you to
link models together and make them interact easily. In other words, when
you use a relational field, you link a record with another one (located
on another model), enabling you to retrieve the content of the fields
located on this linked record.

- **Many2one** fields are filled in by choosing one record from a list
  of records on another model (from *many* records, you select *one*).
  For example, the *customer* field on a quotation makes you choose one
  customer from a list of several customers on the *contact* model.
- **One2many** fields are reverse searches of existing many2one
  relations. For example, you could list on a contact all their existing
  quotations (from *one* record, you display *many*).
- **Many2many** fields are filled in by choosing one or several records
  from a list of records on another model. For example, you can put
  several tags on one product, and several products can use the same
  tags (from *many* records, you can select *many*).

#### Views {#website_themes/setup/databases/views }

Views define how records should be displayed to end-users. They are
specified in XML, meaning they can be edited independently from the
models they represent. They are flexible and allow deep customization of
the screens they control.

##### Backend vs. Frontend {#website_themes/setup/databases/views/backend_vs_frontend }

- **Backend views**: Kanban, List, Form, etc.
- **Frontend view**: QWeb

##### Static vs. Dynamic {#website_themes/setup/databases/views/static_vs_dynamic }

- **Static pages** have stable content, such as the homepage. You can
  define their URL and set some properties like published, indexed, etc.
- **Dynamic pages** are dynamically generated, such as the product page.
  Their URL is dynamic and is accessible to all by default (this can be
  changed by configuring access rights).

##### Base vs. Inherited vs. Duplicated {#website_themes/setup/databases/views/standard_vs_inherited }

- **Base view:** View natively implemented by Odoo. It is directly
  derived from their model. A base view should never be altered as it
  allows updating an Odoo database without overwriting a client\'s
  modification.

Modifications always take place in either a duplicated or inherited view
with some differences:

- **Inherited view** always has an [inherit_id]{.title-ref} and applies
  modifications based on the source code of the base view it inherits
  from.
- **Duplicated view** is a duplication from another one. Most of the
  time this kind of view is created by Odoo when the end-user applies
  modifications through the Website Builder. This mechanism prevents
  data loss when the module is updated because only the source view will
  be updated, not the duplicated one. If a duplicated view exists, both
  the original view and the duplicated one are visible in the list but
  only the duplicated one has an [external_id]{.title-ref} (an
  [external_id]{.title-ref} set means that the view has been created by
  the source code of a module).

### Import an existing database {#website_themes/setup/databases/import }

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

You can directly go to the `theming`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
chapter if you do not need to import an existing database.
::::

#### Dump {#website_themes/setup/databases/import/dump }

##### Odoo SaaS {#website_themes/setup/databases/import/saas }

1.  Log in to a user account with sufficient access rights.
2.  Go to [\<database_url\>/saas_worker/dump]{.title-ref}.

##### Odoo.sh {#website_themes/setup/databases/import/sh }

1.  Connect to Odoo.sh.

2.  Select the branch you want to back up.

3.  Choose the `BACKUPS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

4.  Click the `Create Backup`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

5.  When the process is over, a notification appears. Open it and click
    the `Go to Backup`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

6.  Click the `Download`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon. Select
    `Testing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under
    `Purpose`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
    `With filestore`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under
    `Filestore`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

    ![Download backup](setup/download-backup.png)

7.  You will receive a notification when the dump is ready to be
    downloaded. Open it and click on `Download`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} to get your dump.

    ![Database backup](setup/database-backup.png)

#### Move filestore {#website_themes/setup/databases/import/filestore }

Copy all the folders included in the filestore folder and paste them to
the following location on your computer:

- macOS: [/Users/\<User\>/Library/Application
  Support/Odoo/filestore/\<database_name\>]{.title-ref}
- Linux:
  [/home/\<User\>/.local/share/Odoo/filestore/\<database_name\>]{.title-ref}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

[/Library]{.title-ref} is a hidden folder.
::::

#### Database setup {#website_themes/setup/databases/import/database_setup }

Create an empty database.

``` bash
createdb <database_name>
```

Import the SQL file in the database that you just created.

``` bash
psql <database_name> < dump.sql
```

Reset the admin user password.

``` bash
psql \c
<database_name>
update res_users set login='admin', password='admin' where id=2;
```

If necessary, disable the two-factor authentication enforcing policy
option.

``` bash
psql <database-name>
update res_users set totp_secret='' where id=2;
```

## Getting started {#website_themes/setup/getting_started }

### Running Odoo {#website_themes/setup/getting_started/running_odoo }

Once all dependencies are set up, Odoo can be launched by running
[odoo-bin]{.title-ref}, the command-line interface of the server. It is
located at the root of the Odoo Community directory.

- `Running Odoo <install/source/running_odoo>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/odoo/)

To configure the server, you can specify command-line arguments or a
configuration file. The first method is presented below.

The `CLI <reference/cmdline>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} offers
several functionalities related to Odoo. You can use it to
`run the server <reference/cmdline/server>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, scaffold an Odoo theme, populate a database, or count the
number of lines of code.

### Shell script {#website_themes/setup/getting_started/shell_script }

A typical way to
`run the server <reference/cmdline/server>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} would be to add all command line arguments to a
[.sh]{.title-ref} script.

# Shapes

Shapes are handy if you want to add personality to your website.

In this chapter, you will learn how to add standard and custom
background and image shapes.

## Background shapes {#website_themes/shapes/bg}

Background shapes are SVG files that you can add as a decorative
background in your different sections. Each shape has one or several
customizable colors, and some of them are animated.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Odoo\'s default shapes use the Odoo default colors palette map as
reference. This way, colors will be automatically adapted to a new
palette everytime it changes:

``` scss
default_palette = {
    '1': '#3AADAA',
    '2': '#7C6576',
    '3': '#F6F6F6',
    '4': '#FFFFFF',
    '5': '#383E45',
}
```
::::

### Standard {#website_themes/shapes/bg/standard}

A large selection of default background shapes is available.

**Use**

``` xml
<section data-oe-shape-data="{'shape':'web_editor/Zigs/06'}">
    <div class="o_we_shape o_web_editor_Zigs_06"/>
    <div class="container">
        <!-- Content -->
     </div>
</section>
```

[data-oe-shape-data]{.title-ref} is a JSON object containing information
about your shape like the location of the SVG file, the repeat and flip
options, etc.

For example, you can **flip the shape** horizontally or vertically by
using the X or Y axis like this:

``` xml
<section data-oe-shape-data="{'shape':'web_editor/Zigs/06','flip':[x,y]}">
    <div class="o_we_shape o_we_flip_x o_we_flip_y o_web_editor_Zigs_06"/>
    <div class="container">
        <!-- Content -->
    </div>
</section>
```

#### Colors mapping {#website_themes/shapes/bg/standard/colors}

You can also change the default colors mapping of your shape either by
switching colors in the current map or by creating a alternate map
without modifying the initial one.

##### Switch colors mapping {#website_themes/shapes/bg/standard/colors/switch}

First, we can use a shape like this:

![Initial shape](shapes/shapes-initial.png)

``` xml
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" preserveAspectRatio="none" width="100%" height="100%">
    <defs>
        <svg id="zigs06_top" viewBox="0 0 30 30" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin meet" fill="#383E45" width="100%">
            <path d="M30,7.9C22.5,7.9,22.5,20,15,20S7.5,7.9,0,7.9V0h30V7.9z"/>
        </svg>
        <svg id="zigs06_bottom" viewBox="0 0 30 30" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMax meet" fill="#FFFFFF" width="100%">
            <path d="M0,22.1C7.5,22.1,7.5,10,15,10s7.5,12.1,15,12.1V30H0V22.1z"/>
        </svg>
    </defs>
    <svg>
        <use xlink:href="#zigs06_top"/>
        <use xlink:href="#zigs06_bottom"/>
    </svg>
</svg>
```

Here, we use [#383E45]{.title-ref} and [#FFFFFF]{.title-ref} which
corresponds to the 5th and 4th colors in the Odoo\'s default color
palette.

The shape is declared as follows in SCSS:

``` {.sass caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss``"}
'Zigs/06': ('position': bottom, 'size': 30px 100%, 'colors': (4, 5), 'repeat-x': true),
```

![Shape colors](shapes/shapes-bg.jpg)

The blackish color is used at the top ([c5]{.title-ref}), the lightish
([c4]{.title-ref}) at the bottom and in between, the shape is simply
transparent.

We are going to rewrite the [colors]{.title-ref} map with some [key:
value]{.title-ref} couples:

**With color palette reference and custom color**

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss``"}
$o-bg-shapes: change-shape-colors-mapping('web_editor', 'Zigs/06', (4: 3, 5: rgb(187, 27, 152)))
```

**Or just with references**

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss``"}
$o-bg-shapes: change-shape-colors-mapping('web_editor', 'Zigs/06', (4: 3, 5: 1));
```

The [c4]{.title-ref} (white) will be replaced by [c3]{.title-ref}
(whitish) and [c5]{.title-ref} (black) by [c1]{.title-ref} (white).

**Results**

![Shape final](shapes/shapes-final.png)

![Shape final options](shapes/shapes-final-options.png)

##### Add extra colors mapping {#website_themes/shapes/bg/standard/colors/extra}

Adding extra color mapping allows you to add a color variant to the
template of a shape while keeping the original.

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/boostrap_overridden.scss``"}
$o-bg-shapes: add-extra-shape-colors-mapping('web_editor', 'Zigs/06', 'second', (4: 3, 5: 1));
```

``` xml
<section data-oe-shape-data="{'shape':'web_editor/Zigs/06'}">
    <div class="o_we_shape o_web_editor_Zigs_06 o_second_extra_shape_mapping"/>
    <div class="container">
        <!-- Content -->
    </div>
</section>
```

### Custom {#website_themes/shapes/bg/custom}

Sometimes, your design might require creating one or several custom
shapes.

Firstly, you need to create an SVG file for your shape.

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/static/shapes/hexagons/01.svg``"}
<svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="86" height="100">
    <polygon points="0 25, 43 0, 86 25, 86 75, 43 100, 0 75" style="fill: #3AADAA;"/>
</svg>
```

Make sure to use colors from the default Odoo palette for your shape (as
explained `above <website_themes/shapes/bg>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}).

``` scss
default_palette = {
    '1': '#3AADAA',
    '2': '#7C6576',
    '3': '#F6F6F6',
    '4': '#FFFFFF',
    '5': '#383E45',
}
```

#### Attachment {#website_themes/shapes/bg/custom/attachment}

Declare your shape file.

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/shapes.xml``"}
<record id="shape_hexagon_01" model="ir.attachment">
    <field name="name">01.svg</field>
    <field name="datas" type="base64" file="website_airproof/static/shapes/hexagons/01.svg"/>
    <field name="url">/web_editor/shape/illustration/hexagons/01.svg</field>
    <field name="public" eval="True"/>
</record>
```

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Field          Description
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  name           Name of the shape

  datas          Path to the shape

  url            The location of your shape in the web editor. The file
                 is automatically duplicated in
                 [/web_editor/shape/illustration]{.title-ref} by the
                 Website Builder.

  public         Makes the shape available for later editing.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### SCSS {#website_themes/shapes/bg/custom/scss}

Define the styles of your shape.

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss``"}
$o-bg-shapes: map-merge($o-bg-shapes,
    (
        'illustration': map-merge(
            map-get($o-bg-shapes, 'illustration') or (),
            (
                'hexagons/01': ('position': center center, 'size': auto 100%, 'colors': (1), 'repeat-x': true, 'repeat-y': true),
            ),
        ),
    )
);
```

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Key            Description
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  File location  [hexagons/01]{.title-ref} corresponds to the location of
                 your file in the [shapes]{.title-ref} folder.

  position       Defines the position of your shape.

  size           Defines the size of your shape.

  colors         Defines the color c\* you want it to have (this will
                 override the color you specified in your SVG).

  repeat-x       Defines if the shape is repeated horizontally. This key
                 is optional and only needs to be defined if set to
                 [true]{.title-ref}.

  repeat-y       Defines if the shape is repeated vertically. This key is
                 optional and only needs to be defined if set to
                 [true]{.title-ref}.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Add the option {#website_themes/shapes/bg/custom/option}

Lastly, add your shape to the list of shapes available on the Website
Builder.

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/views/snippets/options.xml``"}
<template id="snippet_options_background_options" inherit_id="website.snippet_options_background_options" name="Airproof - Shapes">
   <xpath expr="//*[hasclass('o_we_bg_shape_menu')]/header[hasclass('o_pager_nav')]//*[hasclass('o_pager_nav_btn')][last()]" position="after">
      <button type="button" class="o_pager_nav_btn p-0 text-uppercase" data-scroll-to="x_scroll_bgshapes_airproof">
         <span class="w-100">Airproof</span>
      </button>
   </xpath>
   <xpath expr="//*[hasclass('o_we_bg_shape_menu')]/div[hasclass('o_pager_container')]" position="inside">
      <div class="x_scroll_bgshapes_airproof">
         <we-title>Airproof</we-title>
         <we-select-page string="Airproof">
            <we-button data-shape="illustration/airproof/01" data-select-label="Airproof 01"/>
         </we-select-page>
      </div>
   </xpath>
</template>
```

#### Use it into your pages {#website_themes/shapes/bg/custom/use}

In your XML pages, you can use your shape in the same way as the others.

``` xml
<section class="..." data-oe-shape-data="{'shape': 'illustration/airproof/01', 'colors': 'c4': '#8595A2', 'c5': 'rgba(0, 255, 0)'}">
    <div class="o_we_shape o_illustration_airproof_01"/>
    <div class="container">
        <!-- Content -->
    </div>
</section>
```

You can also redefine colors using the [data-oe-shape-data
attribute]{.title-ref}, but this is optional.

# Theming

After your development environment is fully set up, you can start
building the skeleton of your theme module. In this chapter, you will
discover how to:

- Enable/disable the Website Builder\'s standard options and templates.
- Define the colors and fonts to use for your design.
- Get the most out of Bootstrap variables.
- Add custom styles and JavaScript.

## Theme module {#theming/module}

Odoo comes with a default theme that provides minimal structure and
layout. When you create a new theme, you are extending the default
theme.

Remember to add the directory containing your module to the
[addons-path]{.title-ref} command-line argument when running Odoo in
your development environment.

### Technical naming {#theming/module/naming}

The first step is to create a new directory.

``` xml
website_airproof
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Prefix it with [website\_]{.title-ref} and use only lowercase ASCII
alphanumeric characters and underscores.

In this documentation, we will use **Airproof** (a fictional project) as
an example.
::::

### File structure {#theming/module/structure}

Themes are packaged like any Odoo module. Even if you are designing a
basic website, you need to package its theme like a module.

    website_airproof

                 [\*.scss]{.title-ref}, [\*.js]{.title-ref})

  views          Custom views and templates ([\*.xml]{.title-ref})
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Initialization {#theming/module/initialization}

An Odoo module is also a Python package with a
`__init__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file containing import
instructions for various Python files in the module. This file can
remain empty for now.

### Declaration {#theming/module/declaration}

An Odoo module is declared by its manifest file. This file declares a
Python package as an Odoo module and specifies the module\'s metadata.
It must at least contain the [name]{.title-ref} field, which is always
required. It usually contains much more information.

``` {.python caption="``/website_airproof/__manifest__.py``"}
{
   'name': 'Airproof Theme',
   'description': '...',
   'category': 'Website/Theme',
   'version': '{BRANCH}.0',
   'author': '...',
   'license': '...',
   'depends': ['website'],
   'data': [
      # ...
   ],
   'assets': {
      # ...
   },
}
```

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Field          Description
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------
  name           Human-readable name of the module (required)

  description    Extended description of the module, in
                 [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText)

  category       Classification category within Odoo

  version        Odoo version this module is addressing

  author         Name of the module author

  license        By default, we use the [LGPL-3]{.title-ref} license. More
                 information in the `module manifest
                 <reference/module/manifest>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} page.

  depends        Odoo modules must be loaded before this one, either because this
                 module uses features they create or because it alters resources they
                 define

  data           List of XML files

  assets         List of SCSS and JS files
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- The file structure above is just a suggestion. We could add as many
other folders as needed in the project, such as
[/controllers]{.title-ref} to include controllers or
[/views/backend]{.title-ref} for backend views, etc. - To create a
website theme, you only need to install the Website app. If you need
other apps (Blogs, Events, eCommerce, \...), you can also add them. -
Odoo version and major number are mandatory. However, patch number is
optional. If you want to specify the required version of Odoo to run
your module, you should use a five arguments structure, using the first
two arguments to indicate your current Odoo version ([\* =
{BRANCH}]{.title-ref}).

![Module versioning](theming/versioning.png){width="300px"}

Example: [{BRANCH}.1.0.0]{.title-ref}
[odoo_major.odoo_minor.module_major.module_minor.module_patch]{.title-ref}
::::

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Automated file inclusion using wildcard notations [(ex.:
/myfolder/\*.scss)]{.title-ref} doesn\'t work in Odoo SaaS databases. In
this case, include each file manually in the manifest.
::::

## Default options {#theming/options}

First, try to construct your theme by using Odoo\'s default options.
This ensures two things:

1.  You do not re-invent something which already exists. For example, as
    Odoo provides an option to add a border on the footer, you
    shouldn\'t recode it yourself. Instead, enable the default option
    first, then extend it if needed.
2.  The user can still use all of Odoo\'s features with your theme. For
    example, if you recode the border on the footer, you may break the
    default option or make it useless, giving the user a bad experience.
    Also, your recode might not work as well as the default option, as
    other Odoo features may rely on it.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- Use four spaces per indentation level. - Do not use tabs. - Never mix
spaces and tabs.

`Odoo coding guidelines <../../../contributing/development/coding_guidelines>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

### Odoo variables {#theming/module/variables}

Odoo declares many CSS rules, most entirely customizable by overriding
the related SCSS variables. To do so, create a
`primary_variables.scss`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file and add it
to the [\_assets_primary_variables]{.title-ref} bundle.

**Declaration**

``` {.python caption="``/website_airproof/__manifest__.py``"}
'assets': {
   'web._assets_primary_variables': [
      'website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss',
   ],
},
```

By reading the source code, variables related to options are easily
noticeable.

``` xml
<we-button title="..."
   data-name="..."
   data-customize-website-views="..."
   data-customize-website-variable="'Sidebar'"
   data-img="..."/>
```

These variables can be overridden through the
[\$o-website-value-palettes]{.title-ref} map, for example.

#### Global {#theming/module/variables/global}

**Declaration**

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss``"}
$o-website-values-palettes: (
   (
      // Templates
      // Colors
      // Fonts
      // Buttons
      // ...
   ),
);
```

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

That file must only contain definitions and overrides of SCSS variables
and mixins.

:::

#### Fonts {#theming/module/variables/fonts}

You can embed any font on your website. The Website Builder
automatically makes them available in the font selector.

**Declaration**

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss``"}
$o-theme-font-configs: (
   <font-name>: (
      'family': <css font family list>,
      'url' (optional): <related part of Google fonts URL>,
      'properties' (optional): (
         <font-alias>: (
            <website-value-key>: <value>,
            ...,
         ),
      ...,
   )
)
```

**Use**

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss``"}
$o-website-values-palettes: (
   (
      'font':                             '<font-name>',
      'headings-font':                    '<font-name>',
      'navbar-font':                      '<font-name>',
      'buttons-font':                     '<font-name>',
   ),
);
```

##### Google fonts {#theming/module/variables/fonts/google}

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss``"}
$o-theme-font-configs: (
   'Poppins': (
      'family':                         ('Poppins', sans-serif),
      'url':                            'Poppins:400,500',
      'properties' : (
         'base': (
            'font-size-base':           1rem,
         ),
      ),
   ),
);
```

##### Custom fonts {#theming/module/variables/fonts/custom}

First, create a specific SCSS file to declare your custom font(s).

``` {.python caption="``/website_airproof/__manifest__.py``"}
'assets': {
   'web.assets_frontend': [
      'website_airproof/static/src/scss/font.scss',
   ],
},
```

Then, use the [\@font-face]{.title-ref} rule to allow you custom font(s)
to be loaded on your website.

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/font.scss``"}
@font-face {
   font-family: "My Custom Font", Helvetica, Helvetica Neue, Arial, sans-serif;
   font-weight: 400;
   font-style: normal;
   src: url('/fonts/my-custom-font.woff') format('woff'),
        url('/fonts/my-custom-font.woff2') format('woff2');
}

#### Colors {#theming/module/variables/colors}

The Website Builder relies on palettes composed of five named colors.
Defining those in your theme ensures it stays consistent.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Color          Description
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  o-color-1      Primary

  o-color-2      Secondary

  o-color-3      Extra (Light)

  o-color-4      Whitish

  o-color-5      Blackish
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

![Theme colors](theming/theme-colors.png){width="300px"}

**Declaration**

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss``"}
$o-color-palettes: map-merge($o-color-palettes,
   (
      'airproof': (
         'o-color-1':                    #bedb39,
         'o-color-2':                    #2c3e50,
         'o-color-3':                    #f2f2f2,
         'o-color-4':                    #ffffff,
         'o-color-5':                    #000000,
      ),
   )
);
```

Add the created palette to the list of palettes offered by the Website
Builder.

``` scss
$o-selected-color-palettes-names: append($o-selected-color-palettes-names, 'airproof');
```

**Use**

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss``"}
$o-website-values-palettes: (
   (
      'color-palettes-name':              'airproof',
   ),
);
```

![Theme colors Airproof](theming/theme-colors-airproof.png){width="800px"}

**Color combinations**

Based on the previously defined five color palettes, the Website Builder
automatically generates five color combinations, each defining a color
for the background, text, headings, links, primary buttons, and
secondary buttons. These colors can be customized later by the user.

![Theme colors](theming/theme-colors-big.png){width="300px"}

The colors used in a color combination are accessible and can be
overridden through [\$o-color-palettes]{.title-ref} using a specific
prefix ([o-cc]{.title-ref} for [color combination]{.title-ref}).

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss``"}
$o-color-palettes: map-merge($o-color-palettes,
   (
      'airproof': (

         'o-cc*-bg':                     'o-color-*',
         'o-cc*-text':                   'o-color-*',
         'o-cc*-headings':               'o-color-*',
         'o-cc*-h2':                     'o-color-*',
         'o-cc*-h3':                     'o-color-*',
         'o-cc*-h4':                     'o-color-*',
         'o-cc*-h5':                     'o-color-*',
         'o-cc*-h6':                     'o-color-*',
         'o-cc*-link':                   'o-color-*',
         'o-cc*-btn-primary':            'o-color-*',
         'o-cc*-btn-primary-border':     'o-color-*',
         'o-cc*-btn-secondary':          'o-color-*',
         'o-cc*-btn-secondary-border':   'o-color-*',

      ),
   )
);
```

:::: note

Note
:::

For each [o-cc\*]{.title-ref}, replace the [\*]{.title-ref} with the
digit (1 - 5) corresponding to the desired color combination.

The default text color is [o-color-5]{.title-ref}. If the background is
too dark, it will automatically change to the [o-color-4]{.title-ref}
color.

#### Gradients {#theming/module/variables/gradients}

You can also define gradients for the menu, header, footer and copyright
bar, directly in your [primary_variables.scss]{.title-ref} file.

**Declaration**

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss``"}
$o-website-values-palettes: (
   (
      'menu-gradient': linear-gradient(135deg, rgb(203, 94, 238) 0%, rgb(75, 225, 236) 100%),
      'header-boxed-gradient': [your-gradient],
      'footer-gradient': [your-gradient],
      'copyright-gradient': [your-gradient],
   ),
);
```

### Bootstrap variables {#theming/module/bootstrap}

Odoo includes Bootstrap by default. You can use all variables and mixins
of the framework.

If Odoo does not provide the variable you are looking for, there could
be a Bootstrap variable that allows it. Indeed all Odoo layouts respect
Bootstrap structures and use Bootstrap components or their extensions.
If you customize a Bootstrap variable, you add a generic style for the
whole user website.

Use a dedicated file added to the
`_assets_frontend_helpers`{.interpreted-text role="file"} bundle to
override Bootstrap values and *not* the
`primary_variables.scss`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file.

**Declaration**

``` {.python caption="``/website_airproof/__manifest__.py``"}
'assets': {
   'web._assets_frontend_helpers': [
      ('prepend', 'website_airproof/static/src/scss/bootstrap_overridden.scss'),
   ],
},
```

**Use**

``` {.scss caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/bootstrap_overridden.scss``"}
// Typography
$h1-font-size:                 4rem !default;

// Navbar
$navbar-nav-link-padding-x:    1rem!default;

// Buttons + Forms
$input-placeholder-color:      o-color('o-color-1') !default;

// Cards
$card-border-width:            0 !default;
```

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

That file must only contain definitions and overrides of SCSS variables
and mixins.
::::

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Don\'t override Bootstrap variables that depend on Odoo variables.
Otherwise, you might break the possibility for the user to customize
them using the Website Builder.

When an option is defined by a variable in
[primary_variables.scss]{.title-ref} and by a Boostrap variable, you
should always go for an override through the primary variables. Do it
via [bootstrap_overridden.scss]{.title-ref} only if nothing exists in
the primary variables.

#### Font sizes {#theming/module/bootstrap/fonts}

Odoo has CSS font size classes to separate style (font sizes) and
semantic (tag and styles in general). Both logic can be combined to be
more flexible.

::: seealso
[Bootstrap documentation about display
headings](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/typography/#display-headings)
:::

##### Text style {#theming/module/bootstrap/fonts/text}

Odoo\'s Website Builder allows to select a style for your text. Some are
just tag related like the [Header]{.title-ref} with no extra CSS class.
Other combine tag and style directly applied on them like the [Header 1
Display]{.title-ref}.

![Header styles](theming/header.png){width="300px"}

``` xml
<!-- h1 with display heading sizes -->
<h1 class="display-1">Heading 1 with Display Heading 1 size</h1>
<h1 class="display-2">Heading 1 with Display Heading 2 size</h1>
<h1 class="display-3">Heading 1 with Display Heading 3 size</h1>
<h1 class="display-4">Heading 1 with Display Heading 4 size</h1>

<!-- Lead text - named "Light" in the dropdown -->
<p class="lead">A text typically used as an introduction.</p>

<!-- Small text -->
<p class="o_small">Body text with a smaller size.</p>
```

##### Sizing classes {#theming/module/bootstrap/fonts/sizing}

The sizing classes are added on a freshly created [span]{.title-ref} tag
inside the targeted element (See examples below).

![Sizing classes](theming/sizing.png){width="300px"}

###### Heading and body text {#theming/module/bootstrap/fonts/sizing/headings-and-body}

Assuming these classes can be applied on any text element, take
[h2]{.title-ref} as an example below:

``` xml
<!-- h2 sized like an h1 -->
<h2><span class="h1-fs">Heading</span></h2>

<!-- h2 sized with other heading sizes -->
<h2><span class="h2-fs">Heading</span></h2>
<h2><span class="h3-fs">Heading</span></h2>
<h2><span class="h4-fs">Heading</span></h2>
<h2><span class="h5-fs">Heading</span></h2>
<h2><span class="h6-fs">Heading</span></h2>

<!-- h2 sized like a normal paragraph (base size, 16px by default) -->
<h2><span class="base-fs">Heading</span></h2>

<!-- h2 sized like a small text (14px by default) -->
<h2><span class="o_small-fs">Heading</span></h2>
```

###### Display headings {#theming/module/bootstrap/fonts/sizing/display}

If larger titles are needed, Odoo uses Bootstrap\'s Display Headings
classes, from [display-1]{.title-ref} to [6]{.title-ref}.

``` xml
<h2><span class="display-1-fs">Heading</span></h2>
<h2><span class="display-2-fs">Heading</span></h2>
<h2><span class="display-3-fs">Heading</span></h2>
<h2><span class="display-4-fs">Heading</span></h2>
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The Website Builder allows the user to configure only sizes from
[Display 1]{.title-ref} to [Display 4]{.title-ref}. You can set the
other sizes ([5]{.title-ref} and [6]{.title-ref}) to use them in your
code but the user won\'t be able to modify them directly within the
Website Builder interface.
::::

### Website settings {#theming/module/website}

Global options related to the website can be set through the website
record by following the structure below.

**Declaration**

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/website.xml``"}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Field                   Description
  ----------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  name                    Name of the website (displayed in the browser)

  favicon                 Path to the favicon (previously created into a record)

  shop_ppg                Number of products shown per page in the e-commerce

  shop_ppr                Number of products shown per rows (in a page) in the
                          e-commerce

  cookies_bar             Enable/disable the cookies bar

  contact_us_button_url   URL of the [Contact us]{.title-ref} page (For instance,
                          used in the standard header templates).

  social_facebook         URL of a Facebook profile

  social_instagram        URL of a Instagram profile

  social_linkedin         URL of a LinkedIn company profile

  social_youtube          URL of a YouTube channel
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

[website.default_website]{.title-ref} is the default reference whenever
you work with only one website. If there are several websites in your
database, this record will refer to the default site (the first one).
::::

### Views {#theming/module/views}

For some options, in addition to the Website Builder variable, you also
have to activate a specific view.

By reading the source code, templates related to options are easily
found.

``` xml
<we-button title="..."
   data-name="..."
   data-customize-website-views="website.template_header_default"
   data-customize-website-variable="'...'"
   data-img="..."/>
```

``` xml
<template id="..." inherit_id="..." name="..." active="True"/>
<template id="..." inherit_id="..." name="..." active="False"/>
```

::: seealso
In such cases, the `<template id="...">` syntax should be preferred over
the `<record id="..." model="ir.ui.view">` syntax when defining the
record in XML.

See `reference/data/template`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, especially
about the `active` value.
:::

#### Presets {#theming/module/views/presets}

In order to activate and deactivate views as presets, you should include
those inside the [presets.xml]{.title-ref} file.

**Use**

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/presets.xml``"}
<record id="module.view" model="ir.ui.view">
      <field name="active" eval="False"/>
</record>
```

::: example
**Changing the menu items\' horizontal alignment**

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/presets.xml``"}
<record id="website.template_header_default_align_center" model="ir.ui.view">
   <field name="active" eval="True"/>
</record>
```

The same logic can be used for others Odoo apps as well.

**eCommerce - Display products categories**

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/presets.xml``"}
<record id="website_sale.products_categories" model="ir.ui.view">
   <field name="active" eval="False"/>
</record>
```

**Portal - Disable the language selector**

``` {.xml caption="``/website_airproof/data/presets.xml``"}
<record id="portal.footer_language_selector" model="ir.ui.view">
   <field name="active" eval="False"/>
</record>
```
:::

## Assets {#theming/assets}

For this part, we will refer to the [assets_frontend]{.title-ref} bundle
located in the web module. This bundle specifies the list of assets
loaded by the Website Builder, and the goal is to add your SCSS and JS
files to the bundle.

This is a non-exhaustive list of the frequently used bundles for a
website:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Bundle                             Description
  ---------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  web.\_assets_primary_variables     Mainly used for the [primary_variables.scss]{.title-ref}
                                     file

  web.\_assets_secondary_variables   Mainly used for the
                                     [secondary_variables.scss]{.title-ref} file

  web.\_assets_frontend_helpers      Mainly used for the
                                     [bootstrap_overridden.scss]{.title-ref} file

  web.assets_frontend                You can add all your custom SCSS, JS or QWeb JS files

  website.assets_wysiwyg             Add your JS files related to the Website Builder options
                                     behaviors (for instance, a custom method for your custom
                                     building block)

  website.assets_wysiwyg             If you need to extend Boostrap through the Bootstrap
                                     Utilities API, for example
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Styles {#theming/assets/styles}

The Website Builder together with Bootstrap are great for defining the
basic styles of your website. But to design something unique, you should
go a step further. For this, you can easily add any SCSS file to your
theme.

**Declaration**

``` {.python caption="``/website_airproof/__manifest__.py``"}
'assets': {
   'web.assets_frontend': [
      'website_airproof/static/src/scss/theme.scss',
   ],
},
```

Feel free to reuse the variables from your Bootstrap file and the ones
used by Odoo in your `theme.scss`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file.

::: {.example caption="``/website_airproof/static/src/scss/theme.scss``"}
.. code-block:: javascript

blockquote {

:   border-radius: \$rounded-pill; color: o-color(\'o-color-3\');
    font-family: o-website-value(\'headings-font\');

}
:::

### Interactivity {#theming/assets/interactivity}

Odoo supports three different kinds of JavaScript files:

- `plain JavaScript files <frontend/modules/plain_js>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} (no module system),
- `native JavaScript module <frontend/modules/native_js>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, and
- `Odoo modules <frontend/modules/odoo_module>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} (using a custom module system).

Most new Odoo JavaScript codes should use the native JavaScript module
system. It\'s simpler and brings the benefit of a better developer
experience with better integration with the IDE.

**Declaration**

``` {.python caption="``/website_airproof/__manifest__.py``"}
'assets': {
   'web.assets_frontend': [
      'website_airproof/static/src/js/theme.js',
   ],
},
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If you want to include files from an external library, you can add them
to the `/lib`{.interpreted-text role="file"} folder of your module.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- Use a linter (JSHint, \...). - Never add minified JavaScript
libraries. - Add [\'use strict\';]{.title-ref} at the top of every
old-style module (this is automatic for new-style modules). - Use
[js\_]{.title-ref} prefixed CSS classes on elements you target with
JavaScript. - Variables and functions should be *camelCased*
([myVariable]{.title-ref}) instead of *snake_cased*
([my_variable]{.title-ref}). - Do not name a variable
[event]{.title-ref}; use [ev]{.title-ref} instead. This is to avoid bugs
on non-Chrome browsers, as Chrome is magically assigning a global
[event]{.title-ref} variable (so if you use the [event]{.title-ref}
variable without declaring it, it will work fine on Chrome but crash on
every other browser). - Use strict comparisons ([===]{.title-ref}
instead of [==]{.title-ref}). - Use double quotes for all textual
strings (such as [\"Hello\"]{.title-ref}) and single quotes for all
other strings, such as a CSS selector [.x_nav_item]{.title-ref}. - If
you\'re using native standard JS functions ([start()]{.title-ref},
[willStart()]{.title-ref}, [cleanForSave()]{.title-ref}, etc), make sure
you call [this.\_super.apply(this, arguments)]{.title-ref}; (Check if
it\'s necessary in the standard code).

--- SOURCE: developer/howtos/website_themes/translations.md ---

# Translations

With Odoo, you can translate your website into different languages.

In this chapter, you will learn how to:

- Translate the content of a module.
- Import and export translations.
- Integrate translations to a module.

## Frontend {#website_themes/translations/frontend}

To translate your pages with the Website Builder, go to your website and
click on the language selector to switch to it. If your website was
never translated to the target language, click
`Add a language...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select it in the
pop-up window, and click `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Click `Translate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to start
translating. Depending on the language, some text is automatically
translated and highlighted in green, while everything that should be
translated manually is highlighted in yellow.

![Translate button](translations/translate-button.png){width="570px"}

However, you have to understand what\'s happening under the hood when
you translate something through the Website Builder.

### Default pages {#website_themes/translations/frontend/default_pages}

Odoo creates a base view once the Website is installed. If you edit the
page with the Builder, a duplicated view will be created and all your
modifications will be saved into this one (and your translations also).
The only exception concerns the homepage (by default, Odoo creates a
base and duplicated view even before you\'ve edited anything).

![Translations dupliclated page](translations/translations-page.png)

We recommend to be very careful about the order in which you will carry
out translations or modifications in the source language, either if you
created the page through the Website Builder or through the source code
with a record. Note that every single modification of the source
language ([Edit master]{.title-ref}) will break the link between the
source language and the existing translations. In other words, you\'ll
have to re-create the translations if you edit the source language.

### Translatable strings {#website_themes/translations/frontend/strings}

::: {#website_themes/translations/frontend/strings/t-att}
t-att- / t-attf-\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~
:::

If you want to set a translatable string, use preferably
[t-attf-]{.title-ref} instead of [t-att-]{.title-ref} whenever possible.

**Example**

To write "Hello *username*", you can do it in the following way:

``` xml
<div t-attf-title="Hello #{user.name}" />
```

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

You could also achieve the same result with an [t-att-title]{.title-ref}
like the example below. However, the result won\'t be considered
natively as a translatable string:

``` xml
<div t-att-title="'Hello' + user.name" />
```
::::

#### Exception: t-value / t-valuef {#website_themes/translations/frontend/strings/exception}

[t-value]{.title-ref} and [t-valuef]{.title-ref} are a bit different.
None of them are explicitly translatable, so you could write something
like this:

``` xml
<t t-set=”additional_title”>My Page Title Shown in the Browser Tab</t>
```

As we are writing XML context, text located between two XML tags are
translatable.

#### Mixing translatable and non-translatable {#website_themes/translations/frontend/strings/mixing}

In a situation where we need to set a translatable text in only one
single place:

``` xml
<t t-set=”title”>Foo</t>
```

And then we need to call it in different locations:

``` xml
<div t-att-title=”label” />
...
<nav t-att-title=”label” />
```

Here we just called the translatable content into a non-translatable
attribute ([t-att-title]{.title-ref}). So the [t-att-title]{.title-ref}
is not translatable but the casted variable is.

## Backend {#website_themes/translations/backend}

Translating pages directly from the backend allows you to translate
several languages at the same time. To do so, go to
`Settings --> Technical --> User Interface: Views`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, search for the name of the page you want to
translate, and click the `Edit Translations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

![Edit translations](translations/edit-translations.png){width="718px"}

## Export {#website_themes/translations/export}

Once you are done translating, you need to export the translations to
integrate them into your module. To export everything at once, open your
database, activate `developer mode
<developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and go to
`Settings --> Translations --> Export Translation`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select the `Language`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} you translated, *PO File* under
`File Format`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and *website_airproof*
as the `Apps To Export`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Download the file and move it to the `i18n`{.interpreted-text
role="file"} folder. If needed, you can manually edit the
`.po`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file afterward.

## PO file {#website_themes/translations/po}

You can translate directly by editing a `.po`{.interpreted-text
role="file"} file or creating the file yourself. Check out the
`translating modules documentation <../translations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to write your translations.

``` {.po caption="``/website_coconuts/i18n/fr_BE.po``"}
#. module: website_airproof
#: model_terms:ir.ui.view,arch_db:website_airproof.s_custom_snippet
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."
```

## Import {#website_themes/translations/import}

To import your translation files into Odoo, go to
`Settings --> Translations -->
Import Translation`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and upload
them.

# Website themes

![Artistic illustration of \"Web design\"](website_themes/web-design.png){width="600px"}

The Odoo Website Builder is an excellent tool for creating a website
fully integrated with other Odoo apps. Using the theme\'s options and
building blocks is easy and allows you to personalize your web presence
the way you want. However, you can take things even further.

In this documentation, you will learn to completely customize your
website without touching Odoo\'s core files, and this way, preserve the
editing options of the Website Builder.

The information compiled in this documentation is based on our past
experiences - both failures and successes. We invite you to use it as a
base to build your own website and adapt it to your needs.

# Actions

Actions define the behavior of the system in response to user actions:
login, action button, selection of an invoice, \...

Actions can be stored in the database or returned directly as
dictionaries in e.g. button methods. All actions share two mandatory
attributes:

`type`

:   the category of the current action, determines which fields may be
    used and how the action is interpreted

`name`

:   short user-readable description of the action, may be displayed in
    the client\'s interface

A client can get actions in 4 forms:

- 

  `False`

  :   if any action dialog is currently open, close it

- 

  A string

  :   if a `client action <reference/actions/client>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} matches, interpret as a client action\'s tag,
      otherwise treat as a number

- 

  A number

  :   read the corresponding action record from the database, may be a
      database identifier or an `external id`{.interpreted-text
      role="term"}

- 

  A dictionary

  :   treat as a client action descriptor and execute

## Bindings {#reference/bindings}

Aside from their two mandatory attributes, all actions also share
*optional* attributes used to present an action in an arbitrary model\'s
contextual menu:

`binding_model_id`

:   specifies which model the action is bound to

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    For Server Actions, use `model_id`.
    ::::

`binding_type`

:   specifies the type of binding, which is mostly which contextual menu
    the action will appear under

    `action` (default)

    :   Specifies that the action will appear in the
        `Action`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} contextual menu
        of the bound model.

    `report`

    :   Specifies that the action will appear in the
        `Print`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} contextual menu
        of the bound model.

`binding_view_types`

:   a comma-separated list of view types for which the action appears in
    the contextual menu, mostly \"list\" and / or \"form\". Defaults to
    `list,form` (both list and form )

## Window Actions (`ir.actions.act_window`) {#reference/actions/window}

The most common action type, used to present visualisations of a model
through `views <../user_interface/view_records>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}: a window action defines a set of view types (and possibly
specific views) for a model (and possibly specific record of the model).

Its fields are:

`res_model`

:   model to present views for

`views`

:   a list of `(view_id, view_type)` pairs. The second element of each
    pair is the category of the view (list, form, graph, \...) and the
    first is an optional database id (or `False`). If no id is provided,
    the client should fetch the default view of the specified type for
    the requested model (this is automatically done by
    `~odoo.models.Model.fields_view_get`{.interpreted-text
    role="meth"}). The first type of the list is the default view type
    and will be open by default when the action is executed. Each view
    type should be present at most once in the list

`res_id` (optional)

:   if the default view is `form`, specifies the record to load
    (otherwise a new record should be created)

`search_view_id` (optional)

:   `(id, name)` pair, `id` is the database identifier of a specific
    search view to load for the action. Defaults to fetching the default
    search view for the model

`target` (optional)

:   whether the views should be open in the main content area
    (`current`), in full screen mode (`fullscreen`) or in a dialog/popup
    (`new`). Use `main` instead of `current` to clear the breadcrumbs.
    Defaults to `current`.

`context` (optional)

:   additional context data to pass to the views

`domain` (optional)

:   filtering domain to implicitly add to all view search queries

`limit` (optional)

:   number of records to display in lists by default. Defaults to 80 in
    the web client

For instance, to open customers (partner with the `customer` flag set)
with list and form views:

    {
        "type": "ir.actions.act_window",
        "res_model": "res.partner",
        "views": [[False, "list"], [False, "form"]],
        "domain": [["customer", "=", true]],
    }

Or to open the form view of a specific product (obtained separately) in
a new dialog:

    {
        "type": "ir.actions.act_window",
        "res_model": "product.product",
        "views": [[False, "form"]],
        "res_id": a_product_id,
        "target": "new",
    }

In-database window actions have a few different fields which should be
ignored by clients, mostly to use in composing the `views` list:

`view_mode` (default= `list,form` )

:   comma-separated list of view types as a string (/!\\ No spaces
    /!\\). All of these types will be present in the generated `views`
    list (with at least a `False` view_id)

`view_ids`

:   M2M[^1] to view objects, defines the initial content of `views`

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    Act_window views can also be defined cleanly through
    `ir.actions.act_window.view`.

    If you plan to allow multiple views for your model, prefer using
    ir.actions.act_window.view instead of the action `view_ids`

    ``` xml
    <record model="ir.actions.act_window.view" id="test_action_tree">
       <field name="sequence" eval="1"/>
       <field name="view_mode">list</field>
       <field name="view_id" ref="view_test_tree"/>
       <field name="act_window_id" ref="test_action"/>
    </record>
    ```
    ::::

`view_id`

:   specific view added to the `views` list in case its type is part of
    the `view_mode` list and not already filled by one of the views in
    `view_ids`

These are mostly used when defining actions from
`reference/data`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:

``` xml
<record model="ir.actions.act_window" id="test_action">
    <field name="name">A Test Action</field>
    <field name="res_model">some.model</field>
    <field name="view_mode">graph</field>
    <field name="view_id" ref="my_specific_view"/>
</record>
```

will use the \"my_specific_view\" view even if that\'s not the default
view for the model.

The server-side composition of the `views` sequence is the following:

- get each `(id, type)` from `view_ids` (ordered by `sequence`)
- if `view_id` is defined and its type isn\'t already filled, append its
  `(id, type)`
- for each unfilled type in `view_mode`, append `(False, type)`

::: todo
- `usage`?
- `groups_id`?
- `filter`?
:::

## URL Actions (`ir.actions.act_url`) {#reference/actions/url}

Allow opening a URL (website/web page) via an Odoo action. Can be
customized via two fields:

`url`

:   the address to open when activating the action

`target` (default= `new`)

:   the available values are :

    - `new`: opens the URL in a new window/page
    - `self`: opens the URL in the current window/page (replaces the
      actual content)
    - `download`: redirects to a download URL

    example:

<!-- -->

    {
        "type": "ir.actions.act_url",
        "url": "https://odoo.com",
        "target": "self",
    }

This will replace the current content section by the Odoo home page.

## Server Actions (`ir.actions.server`) {#reference/actions/server}

::: autoclass
odoo.addons.base.models.ir_actions.IrActionsServer
:::

Allow triggering complex server code from any valid action location.
Only two fields are relevant to clients:

`id`

:   the in-database identifier of the server action to run

`context` (optional)

:   context data to use when running the server action

In-database records are significantly richer and can perform a number of
specific or generic actions based on their `state`. Some fields (and
corresponding behaviors) are shared between states:

`model_id`

:   Odoo model linked to the action.

`state`

- `code`: Executes python code given through the `code` argument.
- `object_create`: Creates a new record of model `crud_model_id`
  following `fields_lines` specifications.
- `object_write`: Updates the current record(s) following `fields_lines`
  specifications
- `multi`: Executes several actions given through the `child_ids`
  argument.

### State fields

Depending on its state, the behavior is defined through different
fields. The concerned state is given after each field.

`code` (code)

:   Specify a piece of Python code to execute when the action is called

    ``` xml
    <record model="ir.actions.server" id="print_instance">
        <field name="name">Res Partner Server Action</field>
        <field name="model_id" ref="model_res_partner"/>
        <field name="state">code</field>
        <field name="code">
            raise Warning(record.name)
        </field>
    </record>
    ```

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    The code segment can define a variable called `action`, which will
    be returned to the client as the next action to execute:

    ``` xml
    <record model="ir.actions.server" id="print_instance">
        <field name="name">Res Partner Server Action</field>
        <field name="model_id" ref="model_res_partner"/>
        <field name="state">code</field>
        <field name="code">
            if record.some_condition():
                action = {
                    "type": "ir.actions.act_window",
                    "view_mode": "form",
                    "res_model": record._name,
                    "res_id": record.id,
                }
        </field>
    </record>
    ```

    will ask the client to open a form for the record if it fulfills
    some condition
    ::::

`crud_model_id` (create)(required)

:   model in which to create a new record

`link_field_id` (create)

:   many2one to `ir.model.fields`, specifies the current record\'s m2o
    field on which the newly created record should be set (models should
    match)

`fields_lines` (create/write)

:   fields to override when creating or copying the record.
    `~odoo.fields.One2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"} with the
    fields:

    `col1`

    :   `ir.model.fields` to set in the concerned model (`crud_model_id`
        for creates, `model_id` for updates)

    `value`

    :   value for the field, interpreted via `type`

    `type` (value[\|reference\|](##SUBST##|reference|)equation)

    :   If `value`, the `value` field is interpreted as a literal value
        (possibly converted), if `equation` the `value` field is
        interpreted as a Python expression and evaluated

`child_ids` (multi)

:   Specify the multiple sub-actions (`ir.actions.server`) to enact in
    state multi. If sub-actions themselves return actions, the last one
    will be returned to the client as the multi\'s own next action

### Evaluation context {#reference/actions/server/context}

A number of keys are available in the evaluation context of or
surrounding server actions:

- `model` model object linked to the action via `model_id`
- `record`/`records` record/recorset on which the action is triggered,
  can be void.
- `env` Odoo Environment
- `datetime`, `dateutil`, `time`, `timezone` corresponding Python
  modules
- `log: log(message, level='info')` logging function to record debug
  information in ir.logging table
- `Warning` constructor for the `Warning` exception

## Report Actions (`ir.actions.report`) {#reference/actions/report}

Triggers the printing of a report.

If you define your report through a [\<record\>]{.title-ref} instead of
a [\<report\>]{.title-ref} tag and want the action to show up in the
Print menu of the model\'s views, you will also need to specify
`binding_model_id` from `reference/bindings`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. It\'s not necessary to set `binding_type` to `report`,
since `ir.actions.report` will implicitly default to that.

`name` (mandatory)

:   used as the file name if `print_report_name` is not specified.
    Otherwise, only useful as a mnemonic/description of the report when
    looking for one in a list of some sort

`model` (mandatory)

:   the model your report will be about

`report_type` (default=qweb-pdf)

:   either `qweb-pdf` for PDF reports or `qweb-html` for HTML

`report_name` (mandatory)

:   the name (`external id`{.interpreted-text role="term"}) of the qweb
    template used to render the report

`print_report_name`

:   python expression defining the name of the report.

`groups_id`

:   `~odoo.fields.Many2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"} field to
    the groups allowed to view/use the current report

`multi`

:   if set to `True`, the action will not be displayed on a form view.

`paperformat_id`

:   `~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"} field to the
    paper format you wish to use for this report (if not specified, the
    company format will be used)

`attachment_use`

:   if set to `True`, the report is only generated once the first time
    it is requested, and re-printed from the stored report afterwards
    instead of being re-generated every time.

    Can be used for reports which must only be generated once (e.g. for
    legal reasons)

`attachment`

:   python expression that defines the name of the report; the record is
    accessible as the variable `object`

## Client Actions (`ir.actions.client`) {#reference/actions/client}

Triggers an action implemented entirely in the client.

`tag`

:   the client-side identifier of the action, an arbitrary string which
    the client should know how to react to

`params` (optional)

:   a Python dictionary of additional data to send to the client,
    alongside the client action tag

`target` (optional)

:   whether the client action should be open in the main content area
    (`current`), in full screen mode (`fullscreen`) or in a dialog/popup
    (`new`). Use `main` instead of `current` to clear the breadcrumbs.
    Defaults to `current`.

<!-- -->

    {
        "type": "ir.actions.client",
        "tag": "pos.ui"
    }

tells the client to start the Point of Sale interface, the server has no
idea how the POS interface works.

::: seealso
\-
`Tutorial: Client Actions <howtos/web/client_actions>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
:::

## Scheduled Actions (`ir.cron`) {#reference/actions/cron}

::: automodule
odoo.addons.base.models.ir_cron
:::

Actions triggered automatically on a predefined frequency.

`name`

:   Name of the scheduled action (Mainly used in log display)

`interval_number`

:   Number of *interval_type* uom between two executions of the action

`interval_type`

:   Unit of measure of frequency interval (`minutes`, `hours`, `days`,
    `weeks`, `months`)

`model_id`

:   Model on which this action will be called

`code`

:   Code content of the action. Can be a simple call to the model\'s
    method :

    ``` python
    model.<method_name>()
    ```

`nextcall`

:   Next planned execution date of this action (date/time format)

`priority`

:   Priority of the action when executing multiple actions at the same
    time

### Writing cron functions

When running a scheduled action, it\'s recommended that you try to batch
the progress in order to avoid blocking a worker for a long period of
time and possibly run into timeout exceptions. Therefore, you should
split the processing so that each call makes progress on some of the
work to be done.

When writing such a function, you should focus on processing a single
batch. A batch should process one or many records and should generally
take no more than *a few seconds*.

Work is committed by the framework after each batch. The framework will
call the function as many times as necessary to process the remaining
work. Do not reschedule yourself the job.

::: automethod
IrCron.\_commit_progress
:::

``` python
def _cron_do_something(self, *, limit=300):  # limit: allows for tweaking
    domain = [('state', '=', 'ready')]
    records = self.search(domain, limit=limit)
    records.do_something()
    # notify progression
    remaining = 0 if len(records) == limit else self.search_count(domain)
    self.env['ir.cron']._commit_progress(len(records), remaining=remaining)
```

In some cases, you may want to share resources between multiple batches
or manage the loop yourself to handle exceptions. In this case, you
should inform the scheduler of the progress of your work by calling
`IrCron._commit_progress`{.interpreted-text role="func"} and checking
the result. The progress function returns the number of seconds
remaining for the call; if it is 0, you must return as soon as possible.

The following is an example of how to commit after each record that is
processed, while keeping the connection open.

``` python
def _cron_do_something(self):
    assert self.env.context.get('cron_id'), "Run only inside cron jobs"
    domain = [('state', '=', 'ready')]
    records = self.search(domain)
    self.env['ir.cron']._commit_progress(remaining=len(records))

    with open_some_connection() as conn:
        for record in records:
            # You may have other needs; we do some common stuff here:
            # - lock record (also checks existence)
            # - prefetch: break prefetch in this case, we process one record
            # - filtered_domain: record may have changed
            record = record.try_lock_for_update().filtered_domain(domain)
            if not record:
                continue
            # Processing the batch here...
            try
                record.do_something(conn)
                if not self.env['ir.cron']._commit_progress(1):
                    break
            except Exception:
                # if you handle exceptions, the default stategy is to
                # rollback first the error
                self.env.cr.rollback()
                _logger.warning(...)
                # you may commit some status using _commit_progress
```

### Running cron functions

You should not call cron functions directly. There are two ways to run
functions:

::: automethod
IrCron.method_direct_trigger
:::

::: automethod
IrCron.\_trigger
:::

Testing of a cron function should be done by calling
`IrCron.method_direct_trigger`{.interpreted-text role="func"} in the
registry test mode.

### Security

To avoid a fair usage of resources among scheduled actions, some
security measures ensure the correct functioning of your scheduled
actions.

- If a scheduled action encounters an error or a timeout three
  consecutive times, it will skip its current execution and be
  considered as failed.
- If a scheduled action fails its execution five consecutive times over
  a period of at least seven days, it will be deactivated and will
  notify the DB admin.
- A hard-limit exists for the cron execution at the database level after
  which the process executing cron jobs is killed.

[^1]: technically not an M2M: adds a sequence field and may be composed
    of just a view type, without a view id.

# Web Controllers {#reference/controllers}

## Controllers

Controllers need to provide extensibility, much like
`~odoo.models.Model`{.interpreted-text role="class"}, but can\'t use the
same mechanism as the pre-requisites (a database with loaded modules)
may not be available yet (e.g. no database created, or no database
selected).

Controllers thus provide their own extension mechanism, separate from
that of models:

Controllers are created by
`inheriting <python:tut-inheritance>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} from
`~odoo.http.Controller`{.interpreted-text role="class"}. Routes are
defined through methods decorated with
`~odoo.http.route`{.interpreted-text role="func"}:

    class MyController(odoo.http.Controller):
        @route('/some_url', auth='public')
        def handler(self):
            return stuff()

To *override* a controller,
`inherit <python:tut-inheritance>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} from
its class and override relevant methods, re-exposing them if necessary:

    class Extension(MyController):
        @route()
        def handler(self):
            do_before()
            return super(Extension, self).handler()

- decorating with `~odoo.http.route`{.interpreted-text role="func"} is
  necessary to keep the method (and route) visible: if the method is
  redefined without decorating, it will be \"unpublished\"

- the decorators of all methods are combined, if the overriding
  method\'s decorator has no argument all previous ones will be kept,
  any provided argument will override previously defined ones e.g.:

      class Restrict(MyController):
          @route(auth='user')
          def handler(self):
              return super(Restrict, self).handler()

# Mixins and Useful Classes {#reference/mixins}

Odoo implements some useful classes and mixins that make it easy for you
to add often-used behaviours on your objects. This guide will details
most of them, with examples and use cases.

## Messaging features {#reference/mixins/mail}

### Messaging integration {#reference/mixins/mail/chatter}

#### Basic messaging system

Integrating messaging features to your model is extremely easy. Simply
inheriting the `mail.thread` mixin and adding the chatter `<chatter/>`
element to your form view will get you up and running in no time. The
chatter element supports some options to control form behavior:

- `open_attachments`: Shows attachment section expanded by default
- `reload_on_attachment`: Reloads form view when attachments are
  added/removed
- `reload_on_follower`: Reloads form view when followers are updated
- `reload_on_post`: Reloads form view when new messages are posted

::: example
Let\'s create a simplistic model representing a business trip. Since
organizing this kind of trip usually involves a lot of people and a lot
of discussion, let\'s add support for message exchange on the model.

``` python
class BusinessTrip(models.Model):
    _name = 'business.trip'
    _inherit = ['mail.thread']
    _description = 'Business Trip'

    name = fields.Char()
    partner_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', 'Responsible')
    guest_ids = fields.Many2many('res.partner', 'Participants')
```

In the form view:

``` xml
<record id="business_trip_form" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">business.trip.form</field>
    <field name="model">business.trip</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <form string="Business Trip">
            <!-- Your usual form view goes here
            ...
            Then comes chatter integration with options you might want to set -->
            <chatter open_attachments="True"/>
        </form>
    </field>
</record>
```
:::

Once you\'ve added chatter support on your model, users can easily add
messages or internal notes on any record of your model; every one of
those will send a notification (to all followers for messages, to
employee (*base.group_user*) users for internal notes). If your mail
gateway and catchall address are correctly configured, these
notifications will be sent by e-mail and can be replied-to directly from
your mail client; the automatic routing system will route the answer to
the correct thread.

Server-side, some helper functions are there to help you easily send
messages and to manage followers on your record:

**Posting messages**

::: method
message_post(self, body=\'\', subject=None,
message_type=\'notification\', subtype=None, parent_id=False,
attachments=None, \*\*kwargs)

Post a new message in an existing thread, returning the new mail.message
ID.

param str \| Markup body
:   body of the message. Will be escaped if [str]{.title-ref}. Use a
    `~markupsafe.Markup`{.interpreted-text role="class"} object for HTML
    content.

param str message_type
:   see mail_message.message_type field

param int parent_id
:   handle reply to a previous message by adding the parent partners to
    the message in case of private discussion

param list(tuple(str,str)) attachments
:   list of attachment tuples in the form `(name,content)`, where
    content is NOT base64 encoded

param bool body_is_html
:   indicates whether [body]{.title-ref} should be treated as HTML, even
    if [str]{.title-ref}.

param [\*\*kwargs]{.title-ref}
:   extra keyword arguments will be used as default column values for
    the new mail.message record

return
:   ID of newly created mail.message

rtype
:   int
:::

::: method
message_post_with_view(views_or_xmlid, \*\*kwargs):

Helper method to send a mail / post a message using a view_id to render
using the ir.qweb engine. This method is stand alone, because there is
nothing in template and composer that allows to handle views in batch.
This method will probably disappear when templates handle ir ui views.

param str or `ir.ui.view` record
:   external id or record of the view that should be sent
:::

::: method
message_post_with_template(template_id, \*\*kwargs)

Helper method to send a mail with a template

param template_id
:   the id of the template to render to create the body of the message

param [\*\*kwargs]{.title-ref}
:   parameter to create a mail.compose.message wizard (which inherit
    from mail.message)
:::

**Receiving messages**

These methods are called when a new e-mail is processed by the mail
gateway. These e-mails can either be new thread (if they arrive via an
`alias <reference/mixins/mail/alias>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}) or
simply replies from an existing thread. Overriding them allows you to
set values on the thread\'s record depending on some values from the
email itself (i.e. update a date or an e-mail address, add CC\'s
addresses as followers, etc.).

::: method
message_new(msg_dict, custom_values=None)

Called by `message_process` when a new message is received for a given
thread model, if the message did not belong to an existing thread.

The default behavior is to create a new record of the corresponding
model (based on some very basic info extracted from the message).
Additional behavior may be implemented by overriding this method.

param dict msg_dict
:   a map containing the email details and attachments. See
    `message_process` and `mail.message.parse` for details

param dict custom_values
:   optional dictionary of additional field values to pass to create()
    when creating the new thread record; be careful, these values may
    override any other values coming from the message

rtype
:   int

return
:   the id of the newly created thread object
:::

::: method
message_update(msg_dict, update_vals=None)

Called by `message_process` when a new message is received for an
existing thread. The default behavior is to update the record with
`update_vals` taken from the incoming email.

Additional behavior may be implemented by overriding this method.

param dict msg_dict
:   a map containing the email details and attachments; see
    `message_process` and `mail.message.parse()` for details.

param dict update_vals
:   a dict containing values to update records given their ids; if the
    dict is None or is void, no write operation is performed.

return
:   True
:::

**Followers management**

::: method
message_subscribe(partner_ids=None, channel_ids=None, subtype_ids=None,
force=True)

Add partners to the records followers.

param list(int) partner_ids
:   IDs of the partners that will be subscribed to the record

param list(int) channel_ids
:   IDs of the channels that will be subscribed to the record

param list(int) subtype_ids
:   IDs of the subtypes that the channels/partners will be subscribed to
    (defaults to the default subtypes if `None`)

param force
:   if True, delete existing followers before creating new one using the
    subtypes given in the parameters

return
:   Success/Failure

rtype
:   bool
:::

::: method
message_unsubscribe(partner_ids=None, channel_ids=None)

Remove partners from the record\'s followers.

param list(int) partner_ids
:   IDs of the partners that will be subscribed to the record

param list(int) channel_ids
:   IDs of the channels that will be subscribed to the record

return
:   True

rtype
:   bool
:::

::: method
message_unsubscribe_users(user_ids=None)

Wrapper on message_subscribe, using users.

param list(int) user_ids
:   IDs of the users that will be unsubscribed to the record; if None,
    unsubscribe the current user instead.

return
:   True

rtype
:   bool
:::

#### Logging changes

The `mail` module adds a powerful tracking system on fields, allowing
you to log changes to specific fields in the record\'s chatter. To add
tracking to a field, simple set the tracking attribute to True.

::: example
Let\'s track changes on the name and responsible of our business trips:

``` python
class BusinessTrip(models.Model):
    _name = 'business.trip'
    _inherit = ['mail.thread']
    _description = 'Business Trip'

    name = fields.Char(tracking=True)
    partner_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', 'Responsible',
                                 tracking=True)
    guest_ids = fields.Many2many('res.partner', 'Participants')
```

From now on, every change to a trip\'s name or responsible will log a
note on the record. The `name` field will be displayed in the
notification as well to give more context about the notification (even
if the name did not change).
:::

#### Subtypes

Subtypes give you more granular control over messages. Subtypes act as a
classification system for notifications, allowing subscribers to a
document to customize the subtype of notifications they wish to receive.

Subtypes are created as data in your module; the model has the following
fields:

`name` (mandatory) - `~odoo.fields.Char`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

:   name of the subtype, will be displayed in the notification
    customization popup

`description` - `~odoo.fields.Char`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

:   description that will be added in the message posted for this
    subtype. If void, the name will be added instead

`internal` - `~odoo.fields.Boolean`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

:   messages with internal subtypes will be visible only by employees,
    aka members of the `base.group_user` group

`parent_id` - `~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

:   link subtypes for automatic subscription; for example project
    subtypes are linked to task subtypes through this link. When someone
    is subscribed to a project, he will be subscribed to all tasks of
    this project with subtypes found using the parent subtype

`relation_field` - `~odoo.fields.Char`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

:   as an example, when linking project and tasks subtypes, the relation
    field is the project_id field of tasks

`res_model` - `~odoo.fields.Char`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

:   model the subtype applies to; if False, this subtype applies to all
    models

`default` - `~odoo.fields.Boolean`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

:   whether the subtype is activated by default when subscribing

`sequence` - `~odoo.fields.Integer`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

:   used to order subtypes in the notification customization popup

`hidden` - `~odoo.fields.Boolean`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

:   whether the subtype is hidden in the notification customization
    popup

Interfacing subtypes with field tracking allows to subscribe to
different kind of notifications depending on what might interest users.
To do this, you can override the `_track_subtype()` function:

::: method
[track_subtype]{#track_subtype}(init_values)

Give the subtype triggered by the changes on the record according to
values that have been updated.

param dict init_values
:   the original values of the record; only modified fields are present
    in the dict

returns
:   a subtype\'s full external id or False if no subtype is triggered
:::

::: example
Let\'s add a `state` field on our example class and trigger a
notification with a specific subtype when this field change values.

First, let\'s define our subtype:

``` xml
<record id="mt_state_change" model="mail.message.subtype">
    <field name="name">Trip confirmed</field>
    <field name="res_model">business.trip</field>
    <field name="default" eval="True"/>
    <field name="description">Business Trip confirmed!</field>
</record>
```

Then, we need to override the `track_subtype()` function. This function
is called by the tracking system to know which subtype should be used
depending on the change currently being applied. In our case, we want to
use our shiny new subtype when the `state` field changes from *draft* to
*confirmed*:

``` python
class BusinessTrip(models.Model):
    _name = 'business.trip'
    _inherit = ['mail.thread']
    _description = 'Business Trip'

    name = fields.Char(tracking=True)
    partner_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', 'Responsible',
                                 tracking=True)
    guest_ids = fields.Many2many('res.partner', 'Participants')
    state = fields.Selection([('draft', 'New'), ('confirmed', 'Confirmed')],
                             tracking=True)

    def _track_subtype(self, init_values):
        # init_values contains the modified fields' values before the changes
        #
        # the applied values can be accessed on the record as they are already
        # in cache
        self.ensure_one()
        if 'state' in init_values and self.state == 'confirmed':
            return self.env.ref('my_module.mt_state_change')
        return super(BusinessTrip, self)._track_subtype(init_values)
```
:::

#### Customizing notifications

When sending notifications to followers, it can be quite useful to add
buttons in the template to allow quick actions directly from the e-mail.
Even a simple button to link directly to the record\'s form view can be
useful; however in most cases you don\'t want to display these buttons
to portal users.

The notification system allows customizing notification templates in the
following ways:

- Display *Access Buttons*: these buttons are visible at the top of the
  notification e-mail and allow the recipient to directly access the
  form view of the record
- Display *Follow Buttons*: these buttons allow the recipient to
  directly quickly subscribe from the record
- Display *Unfollow Buttons*: these buttons allow the recipient to
  directly quickly unsubscribe from the record
- Display *Custom Action Buttons*: these buttons are calls to specific
  routes and allow you to make some useful actions directly available
  from the e-mail (i.e. converting a lead to an opportunity, validating
  an expense sheet for an Expense Manager, etc.)

These buttons settings can be applied to different groups that you can
define yourself by overriding the function `_notify_get_groups`.

::: method
[notify_get_groups]{#notify_get_groups}(message, groups)

Give the subtype triggered by the changes on the record according to
values that have been updated.

param `record` message
:   `mail.message` record currently being sent

param list(tuple) groups
:   list of tuple of the form (group_name, group_func,group_data) where:

> 
>
> group_name
>
> :   is an identifier used only to be able to override and manipulate
>     groups. Default groups are `user` (recipients linked to an
>     employee user), `portal` (recipients linked to a portal user) and
>     `customer` (recipients not linked to any user). An example of
>     override use would be to add a group linked to a res.groups like
>     Hr Officers to set specific action buttons to them.
>
> group_func
>
> :   is a function pointer taking a partner record as parameter. This
>     method will be applied on recipients to know whether they belong
>     to a given group or not. Only first matching group is kept.
>     Evaluation order is the list order.
>
> group_data
>
> :   is a dict containing parameters for the notification email with
>     the following possible keys - values:
>
>     - 
>
>       has_button_access
>
>       :   whether to display Access \<Document\> in email. True by
>           default for new groups, False for portal / customer.
>
>     - 
>
>       button_access
>
>       :   dict with url and title of the button
>
>     - 
>
>       has_button_follow
>
>       :   whether to display Follow in email (if recipient is not
>           currently following the thread). True by default for new
>           groups, False for portal / customer.
>
>     - 
>
>       button_follow
>
>       :   dict with url and title of the button
>
>     - 
>
>       has_button_unfollow
>
>       :   whether to display Unfollow in email (if recipient is
>           currently following the thread). True by default for new
>           groups, False for portal / customer.
>
>     - 
>
>       button_unfollow
>
>       :   dict with url and title of the button
>
>     - 
>
>       actions
>
>       :   list of action buttons to display in the notification email.
>           Each action is a dict containing url and title of the
>           button.

returns
:   a subtype\'s full external id or False if no subtype is triggered
:::

The urls in the actions list can be generated automatically by calling
the `_notify_get_action_link()` function:

::: method
[notify_get_action_link]{#notify_get_action_link}(self, link_type,
\*\*kwargs)

Generate a link for the given type on the current record (or on a
specific record if the kwargs `model` and `res_id` are set).

param str link_type
:   link type to be generated; can be any of these values:

> 
>
> `view`
>
> :   link to form view of the record
>
> `assign`
>
> :   assign the logged user to the `user_id` field of the record (if it
>     exists)
>
> `follow`
>
> :   self-explanatory
>
> `unfollow`
>
> :   self-explanatory
>
> `method`
>
> :   call a method on the record; the method\'s name should be provided
>     as the kwarg `method`
>
> `new`
>
> :   open an empty form view for a new record; you can specify a
>     specific action by providing its id (database id or fully resolved
>     external id) in the kwarg `action_id`

returns
:   link of the type selected for the record

rtype
:   str
:::

::: example
Let\'s add a custom button to the Business Trip state change
notification; this button will reset the state to Draft and will be only
visible to a member of the (imaginary) group Travel Manager
(`business.group_trip_manager`)

``` python
class BusinessTrip(models.Model):
    _name = 'business.trip'
    _inherit = ['mail.thread', 'mail.alias.mixin']
    _description = 'Business Trip'

    # Pevious code goes here

    def action_cancel(self):
        self.write({'state': 'draft'})

    def _notify_get_groups(self, message, groups):
        """ Handle Trip Manager recipients that can cancel the trip at the last
        minute and kill all the fun. """
        groups = super(BusinessTrip, self)._notify_get_groups(message, groups)

        self.ensure_one()
        if self.state == 'confirmed':
            app_action = self._notify_get_action_link('method',
                                method='action_cancel')
            trip_actions = [{'url': app_action, 'title': _('Cancel')}]

        new_group = (
            'group_trip_manager',
            lambda partner: any(
                user.sudo().has_group('business.group_trip_manager')
                for user in partner.user_ids
            ),
            {'actions': trip_actions},
        )

        return [new_group] + groups
```

Note that that I could have defined my evaluation function outside of
this method and define a global function to do it instead of a lambda,
but for the sake of being more brief and less verbose in these
documentation files that can sometimes be boring, I choose the former
instead of the latter.
:::

#### Overriding defaults

There are several ways you can customize the behaviour of `mail.thread`
models, including (but not limited to):

`_mail_post_access` - `~odoo.models.Model`{.interpreted-text role="class"} attribute

:   the required access rights to be able to post a message on the
    model; by default a `write` access is needed, can be set to `read`
    as well

Context keys:

:   These context keys can be used to somewhat control `mail.thread`
    features like auto-subscription or field tracking during calls to
    `create()` or `write()` (or any other method where it may be
    useful).

    - `mail_create_nosubscribe`: at create or message_post, do not
      subscribe the current user to the record thread
    - `mail_create_nolog`: at create, do not log the automatic
      \'\<Document\> created\' message
    - `mail_notrack`: at create and write, do not perform the value
      tracking creating messages
    - `tracking_disable`: at create and write, perform no MailThread
      features (auto subscription, tracking, post, \...)
    - `mail_auto_delete`: auto delete mail notifications; True by
      default
    - `mail_notify_force_send`: if less than 50 email notifications to
      send, send them directly instead of using the queue; True by
      default
    - `mail_notify_user_signature`: add the current user signature in
      email notifications; True by default

### Mail alias {#reference/mixins/mail/alias}

Aliases are configurable email addresses that are linked to a specific
record (which usually inherits the `mail.alias.mixin` model) that will
create new records when contacted via e-mail. They are an easy way to
make your system accessible from the outside, allowing users or
customers to quickly create records in your database without needing to
connect to Odoo directly.

#### Aliases vs. Incoming Mail Gateway

Some people use the Incoming Mail Gateway for this same purpose. You
still need a correctly configured mail gateway to use aliases, however a
single catchall domain will be sufficient since all routing will be done
inside Odoo. Aliases have several advantages over Mail Gateways:

- 

  Easier to configure

  :   - A single incoming gateway can be used by many aliases; this
        avoids having to configure multiple emails on your domain name
        (all configuration is done inside Odoo)
      - No need for System access rights to configure aliases

- 

  More coherent

  :   - Configurable on the related record, not in a Settings submenu

- 

  Easier to override server-side

  :   - Mixin model is built to be extended from the start, allowing you
        to extract useful data from incoming e-mails more easily than
        with a mail gateway.

#### Alias support integration

Aliases are usually configured on a parent model which will then create
specific record when contacted by e-mail. For example, Project have
aliases to create tasks or issues, Sales Team have aliases to generate
Leads.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The model that will be created by the alias **must** inherit the
`mail_thread` model.
::::

Alias support is added by inheriting `mail.alias.mixin`; this mixin will
generate a new `mail.alias` record for each record of the parent class
that gets created (for example, every `project.project` record having
its `mail.alias` record initialized on creation).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Aliases can also be created manually and supported by a simple
`~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"} field. This
guide assumes you wish a more complete integration with automatic
creation of the alias, record-specific default values, etc.
::::

Unlike `mail.thread` inheritance, the `mail.alias.mixin` **requires**
some specific overrides to work correctly. These overrides will specify
the values of the created alias, like the kind of record it must create
and possibly some default values these records may have depending on the
parent object:

::: method
[get_alias_model_name]{#get_alias_model_name}(vals)

Return the model name for the alias. Incoming emails that are not
replies to existing records will cause the creation of a new record of
this alias model. The value may depend on `vals`, the dict of values
passed to `create` when a record of this model is created.

param vals dict
:   values of the newly created record that will holding the alias

return
:   model name

rtype
:   str
:::

::: method
[get_alias_values]{#get_alias_values}()

Return values to create an alias, or to write on the alias after its
creation. While not completely mandatory, it is usually required to make
sure that newly created records will be linked to the alias\' parent
(i.e. tasks getting created in the right project) by setting a
dictionary of default values in the alias\' `alias_defaults` field.

return
:   dictionary of values that will be written to the new alias

rtype
:   dict
:::

The `_get_alias_values()` override is particularly interesting as it
allows you to modify the behaviour of your aliases easily. Among the
fields that can be set on the alias, the following are of particular
interest:

`alias_name` - `~odoo.fields.Char`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

:   name of the email alias, e.g. \'jobs\' if you want to catch emails
    for \<jobs@example.odoo.com\>

`alias_user_id` - `~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"} (`res.users`)

:   owner of records created upon receiving emails on this alias; if
    this field is not set the system will attempt to find the right
    owner based on the sender (From) address, or will use the
    Administrator account if no system user is found for that address

`alias_defaults` - `~odoo.fields.Text`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

:   Python dictionary that will be evaluated to provide default values
    when creating new records for this alias

`alias_force_thread_id` - `~odoo.fields.Integer`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

:   optional ID of a thread (record) to which all incoming messages will
    be attached, even if they did not reply to it; if set, this will
    disable the creation of new records completely

`alias_contact` - `~odoo.fields.Selection`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

:   Policy to post a message on the document using the mailgateway

    - *everyone*: everyone can post
    - *partners*: only authenticated partners
    - *followers*: only followers of the related document or members of
      following channels

Note that aliases make use of
`delegation inheritance <reference/orm/inheritance>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, which means that while the alias is stored in another
table, you have access to all these fields directly from your parent
object. This allows you to make your alias easily configurable from the
record\'s form view.

::: example
Let\'s add aliases on our business trip class to create expenses on the
fly via e-mail.

``` python
class BusinessTrip(models.Model):
    _name = 'business.trip'
    _inherit = ['mail.thread', 'mail.alias.mixin']
    _description = 'Business Trip'

    name = fields.Char(tracking=True)
    partner_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', 'Responsible',
                                 tracking=True)
    guest_ids = fields.Many2many('res.partner', 'Participants')
    state = fields.Selection([('draft', 'New'), ('confirmed', 'Confirmed')],
                             tracking=True)
    expense_ids = fields.One2many('business.expense', 'trip_id', 'Expenses')
    alias_id = fields.Many2one('mail.alias', string='Alias', ondelete="restrict",
                               required=True)

    def _get_alias_model_name(self, vals):
    """ Specify the model that will get created when the alias receives a message """
        return 'business.expense'

    def _get_alias_values(self):
    """ Specify some default values that will be set in the alias at its creation """
        values = super(BusinessTrip, self)._get_alias_values()
        # alias_defaults holds a dictionary that will be written
        # to all records created by this alias
        #
        # in this case, we want all expense records sent to a trip alias
        # to be linked to the corresponding business trip
        values['alias_defaults'] = {'trip_id': self.id}
        # we only want followers of the trip to be able to post expenses
        # by default
        values['alias_contact'] = 'followers'
        return values

class BusinessExpense(models.Model):
    _name = 'business.expense'
    _inherit = ['mail.thread']
    _description = 'Business Expense'

    name = fields.Char()
    amount = fields.Float('Amount')
    trip_id = fields.Many2one('business.trip', 'Business Trip')
    partner_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', 'Created by')
```

We would like our alias to be easily configurable from the form view of
our business trips, so let\'s add the following to our form view:

``` xml
<page string="Emails">
    <group name="group_alias">
        <label for="alias_name" string="Email Alias"/>
        <div name="alias_def">
            <!-- display a link while in view mode and a configurable field
            while in edit mode -->
            <field name="alias_id" class="oe_read_only oe_inline"
                    string="Email Alias" required="0"/>
            <div class="oe_edit_only oe_inline" name="edit_alias"
                 style="display: inline;" >
                <field name="alias_name" class="oe_inline"/>
                @
                <field name="alias_domain" class="oe_inline" readonly="1"/>
            </div>
        </div>
        <field name="alias_contact" class="oe_inline"
                string="Accept Emails From"/>
    </group>
</page>
```

Now we can change the alias address directly from the form view and
change who can send e-mails to the alias.

We can then override `message_new()` on our expense model to fetch the
values from our email when the expense will be created:

``` python
class BusinessExpense(models.Model):
    # Previous code goes here
    # ...

    def message_new(self, msg, custom_values=None):
        """ Override to set values according to the email.

        In this simple example, we simply use the email title as the name
        of the expense, try to find a partner with this email address and
        do a regex match to find the amount of the expense."""
        name = msg_dict.get('subject', 'New Expense')
        # Match the last occurrence of a float in the string
        # Example: '50.3 bar 34.5' becomes '34.5'. This is potentially the price
        # to encode on the expense. If not, take 1.0 instead
        amount_pattern = '(\d+(\.\d*)?|\.\d+)'
        expense_price = re.findall(amount_pattern, name)
        price = expense_price and float(expense_price[-1][0]) or 1.0
        # find the partner by looking for it's email
        partner = self.env['res.partner'].search([('email', 'ilike', email_address)],
                                                 limit=1)
        defaults = {
            'name': name,
            'amount': price,
            'partner_id': partner.id
        }
        defaults.update(custom_values or {})
        res = super(BusinessExpense, self).message_new(msg, custom_values=defaults)
        return res
```

### Activities tracking {#reference/mixins/mail/activities}

Activities are actions users have to take on a document like making a
phone call or organizing a meeting. Activities come with the mail module
as they are integrated in the Chatter but are *not bundled with
mail.thread*. Activities are records of the `mail.activity` class, which
have a type (`mail.activity.type`), name, description, scheduled time
(among others). Pending activities are visible above the message history
in the chatter widget.

You can integrate activities using the `mail.activity.mixin` class on
your object and the specific widgets to display them (via the field
`activity_ids`) in the form view and kanban view of your records
(`mail_activity` and `kanban_activity` widgets, respectively).

::: example
Organizing a business trip is a tedious process and tracking needed
activities like ordering plane tickets or a cab for the airport could be
useful. To do so, we will add the activities mixin on our model and
display the next planned activities in the message history of our trip.

``` python
class BusinessTrip(models.Model):
    _name = 'business.trip'
    _inherit = ['mail.thread', 'mail.activity.mixin']
    _description = 'Business Trip'

    name = fields.Char()
    # [...]
```

We modify the form view of our trips to display their next activities:

``` xml
<record id="business_trip_form" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">business.trip.form</field>
    <field name="model">business.trip</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <form string="Business Trip">
            <!-- Your usual form view goes here -->
            <chatter>
                <field name="message_follower_ids" widget="mail_followers"/>
                <field name="activity_ids" widget="mail_activity"/>
                <field name="message_ids" widget="mail_thread"/>
            </chatter>
        </form>
    </field>
</record>
```
:::

You can find concrete examples of integration in the following models:

- `crm.lead` in the CRM (*crm*) Application
- `sale.order` in the Sales (*sale*) Application
- `project.task` in the Project (*project*) Application

## Website features {#reference/mixins/website}

### Visitor tracking {#reference/mixins/website/utm}

The `utm.mixin` class can be used to track online
marketing/communication campaigns through arguments in links to
specified resources. The mixin adds 3 fields to your model:

- `campaign_id`: `~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
  field to a `utm.campaign` object (i.e. Christmas_Special,
  Fall_Collection, etc.)
- `source_id`: `~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
  field to a `utm.source` object (i.e. Search Engine, mailing list,
  etc.)
- `medium_id`: `~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
  field to a `utm.medium` object (i.e. Snail Mail, e-Mail, social
  network update, etc.)

These models have a single field `name` (i.e. they are simply there to
distinguish campaigns but don\'t have any specific behaviour).

Once a customer visits your website with these parameters set in the url
(i.e.
<https://www.odoo.com/?campaign_id=mixin_talk&source_id=www.odoo.com&medium_id=website>),
three cookies are set in the visitor\'s website for these parameters.
Once a object that inherits the utm.mixin is created from the website
(i.e. lead form, job application, etc.), the utm.mixin code kicks in and
fetches the values from the cookies to set them in the new record. Once
this is done, you can then use the campaign/source/medium fields as any
other field when defining reports and views (group by, etc.).

To extend this behaviour, simply add a relational field to a simple
model (the model should support the *quick create* (i.e. call to
`create()` with a single `name` value) and extend the function
`tracking_fields()`:

``` python
class UtmMyTrack(models.Model):
    _name = 'my_module.my_track'
    _description = 'My Tracking Object'

    name = fields.Char(string='Name', required=True)


class MyModel(models.Models):
    _name = 'my_module.my_model'
    _inherit = ['utm.mixin']
    _description = 'My Tracked Object'

    my_field = fields.Many2one('my_module.my_track', 'My Field')

    @api.model
    def tracking_fields(self):
        result = super(MyModel, self).tracking_fields()
        result.append([
        # ("URL_PARAMETER", "FIELD_NAME_MIXIN", "NAME_IN_COOKIES")
            ('my_field', 'my_field', 'odoo_utm_my_field')
        ])
        return result
```

This will tell the system to create a cookie named *odoo_utm_my_field*
with the value found in the url parameter `my_field`; once a new record
of this model is created by a call from a website form, the generic
override of the `create()` method of `utm.mixin` will fetch the default
values for this field from the cookie (and the `my_module.my_track`
record will be creatwed on the fly if it does not exist yet).

You can find concrete examples of integration in the following models:

- `crm.lead` in the CRM (*crm*) Application
- `hr.applicant` in the Recruitment Process (*hr_recruitment*)
  Application
- `helpdesk.ticket` in the Helpdesk (*helpdesk* - Odoo Enterprise only)
  Application

### Website visibility {#reference/mixins/website/published}

You can quite easily add a website visibility toggle on any of your
record. While this mixin is quite easy to implement manually, it is the
most often-used after the `mail.thread` inheritance; a testament to its
usefulness. The typical use case for this mixin is any object that has a
frontend-page; being able to control the visibility of the page allows
you to take your time while editing the page and only publish it when
you\'re satisfied.

To include the functionality, you only need to inherit
`website.published.mixin`:

``` python
class BlogPost(models.Model):
    _name = "blog.post"
    _description = "Blog Post"
    _inherit = ['website.published.mixin']
```

This mixin adds 2 fields on your model:

- `website_published`: `~odoo.fields.Boolean`{.interpreted-text
  role="class"} field which represents the status of the publication
- `website_url`: `~odoo.fields.Char`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
  field which represents the URL through which the object is accessed

Note that this last field is a computed field and must be implemented
for your class:

``` python
def _compute_website_url(self):
    for blog_post in self:
        blog_post.website_url = "/blog/%s" % (log_post.blog_id)
```

Once the mechanism is in place, you just have to adapt your frontend and
backend views to make it accessible. In the backend, adding a button in
the button box is usually the way to go:

``` xml
<button class="oe_stat_button" name="website_publish_button"
    type="object" icon="fa-globe">
    <field name="website_published" widget="website_button"/>
</button>
```

In the frontend, some security checks are needed to avoid showing
\'Editing\' buttons to website visitors:

``` xml
<div id="website_published_button" class="float-right"
     groups="base.group_website_publisher"> <!-- or any other meaningful group -->
    <t t-call="website.publish_management">
      <t t-set="object" t-value="blog_post"/>
      <t t-set="publish_edit" t-value="True"/>
      <t t-set="action" t-value="'blog.blog_post_action'"/>
    </t>
</div>
```

Note that you must pass your object as the variable `object` to the
template; in this example, the `blog.post` record was passed as the
`blog_post` variable to the `qweb` rendering engine, it is necessary to
specify this to the publish management template. The `publish_edit`
variable allow the frontend button to link to the backend (allowing you
to switch from frontend to backend and vice-versa easily); if set, you
must specify the full external id of the action you want to call in the
backend in the `action` variable (note that a Form View must exist for
the model).

The action `website_publish_button` is defined in the mixin and adapts
its behaviour to your object: if the class has a valid `website_url`
compute function, the user is redirected to the frontend when he clicks
on the button; the user can then publish the page directly from the
frontend. This ensures that no online publication can happen by
accident. If there is not compute function, the boolean
`website_published` is simply triggered.

### Website metadata {#reference/mixins/website/seo}

This simple mixin simply allows you to easily inject metadata in your
frontend pages.

``` python
class BlogPost(models.Model):
    _name = "blog.post"
    _description = "Blog Post"
    _inherit = ['website.seo.metadata', 'website.published.mixin']
```

This mixin adds 3 fields on your model:

- `website_meta_title`: `~odoo.fields.Char`{.interpreted-text
  role="class"} field that allow you to set an additional title to your
  page
- `website_meta_description`: `~odoo.fields.Char`{.interpreted-text
  role="class"} field that contains a short description of the page
  (sometimes used in search engines results)
- `website_meta_keywords`: `~odoo.fields.Char`{.interpreted-text
  role="class"} field that contains some keywords to help your page to
  be classified more precisely by search engines; the \"Promote\" tool
  will help you select lexically-related keywords easily

These fields are editable in the frontend using the \"Promote\" tool
from the Editor toolbar. Setting these fields can help search engines to
better index your pages. Note that search engines do not base their
results only on these metadata; the best SEO practice should still be to
get referenced by reliable sources.

## Others {#reference/mixins/misc}

### Customer Rating {#reference/mixins/misc/rating}

The rating mixin allows sending email to ask for customer rating,
automatic transitioning in a kanban processes and aggregating statistics
on your ratings.

#### Adding rating on your model

To add rating support, simply inherit the `rating.mixin` model:

``` python
class MyModel(models.Models):
    _name = 'my_module.my_model'
    _inherit = ['rating.mixin', 'mail.thread']

    user_id = fields.Many2one('res.users', 'Responsible')
    partner_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', 'Customer')
```

The behaviour of the mixin adapts to your model:

- The `rating.rating` record will be linked to the `partner_id` field of
  your model (if the field is present).
  - this behaviour can be overridden with the function
    `rating_get_partner_id()` if you use another field than `partner_id`
- The `rating.rating` record will be linked to the partner of the
  `user_id` field of your model (if the field is present) (i.e. the
  partner who is rated)
  - this behaviour can be overridden with the function
    `rating_get_rated_partner_id()` if you use another field than
    `user_id` (note that the function must return a `res.partner`, for
    `user_id` the system automatically fetches the partner of the user)
- The chatter history will display the rating event (if your model
  inherits from `mail.thread`)

#### Send rating requests by e-mail

If you wish to send emails to request a rating, simply generate an
e-mail with links to the rating object. A very basic email template
could look like this:

``` xml
<record id="rating_my_model_email_template" model="mail.template">
            <field name="name">My Model: Rating Request</field>
            <field name="email_from">${object.rating_get_rated_partner_id().email or '' | safe}</field>
            <field name="subject">Service Rating Request</field>
            <field name="model_id" ref="my_module.model_my_model"/>
            <field name="partner_to" >${object.rating_get_partner_id().id}</field>
            <field name="auto_delete" eval="True"/>
            <field name="body_html"><![CDATA[
% set access_token = object.rating_get_access_token()
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>How satsified are you?</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/rate/${access_token}/5">Satisfied</a></li>
    <li><a href="/rate/${access_token}/3">Okay</a></li>
    <li><a href="/rate/${access_token}/1">Dissatisfied</a></li>
</ul>
]]></field>
</record>
```

Your customer will then receive an e-mail with links to a simple webpage
allowing them to provide a feedback on their interaction with your users
(including a free-text feedback message).

You can then quite easily integrate your ratings with your form view by
defining an action for the ratings:

``` xml
<record id="rating_rating_action_my_model" model="ir.actions.act_window">
    <field name="name">Customer Ratings</field>
    <field name="res_model">rating.rating</field>
    <field name="view_mode">kanban,pivot,graph</field>
    <field name="domain">[('res_model', '=', 'my_module.my_model'), ('res_id', '=', active_id), ('consumed', '=', True)]</field>
</record>

<record id="my_module_my_model_view_form_inherit_rating" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">my_module.my_model.view.form.inherit.rating</field>
    <field name="model">my_module.my_model</field>
    <field name="inherit_id" ref="my_module.my_model_view_form"/>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <xpath expr="//div[@name='button_box']" position="inside">
            <button name="%(rating_rating_action_my_model)d" type="action"
                    class="oe_stat_button" icon="fa-smile-o">
                <field name="rating_count" string="Rating" widget="statinfo"/>
            </button>
        </xpath>
    </field>
</record>
```

Note that there are default views (kanban,pivot,graph) for ratings which
allow you a quick bird\'s eye view of your customer ratings.

You can find concrete examples of integration in the following models:

- `project.task` in the Project (*rating_project*) Application
- `helpdesk.ticket` in the Helpdesk (*helpdesk* - Odoo Enterprise only)
  Application

# Module Manifests

## Manifest {#reference/module/manifest}

The manifest file serves to declare a python package as an Odoo module
and to specify module metadata.

It is a file called `__manifest__.py` and contains a single Python
dictionary, where each key specifies module metadatum.

    {
        'name': "A Module",
        'version': '1.0',
        'depends': ['base'],
        'author': "Author Name",
        'category': 'Category',
        'description': """
        Description text
        """,
        # data files always loaded at installation
        'data': [
            'views/mymodule_view.xml',
        ],
        # data files containing optionally loaded demonstration data
        'demo': [
            'demo/demo_data.xml',
        ],
    }

Available manifest fields are:

`name` (`str`, required)

:   the human-readable name of the module

`version` (`str`)

:   this module\'s version, should follow [semantic
    versioning](https://semver.org) rules

`description` (`str`)

:   extended description for the module, in reStructuredText

`author` (`str`)

:   name of the module author

`website` (`str`)

:   website URL for the module author

`license` (`str`, defaults: `LGPL-3`)

:   distribution license for the module. Possible values:

    - [GPL-2]{.title-ref}
    - [GPL-2 or any later version]{.title-ref}
    - [GPL-3]{.title-ref}
    - [GPL-3 or any later version]{.title-ref}
    - [AGPL-3]{.title-ref}
    - [LGPL-3]{.title-ref}
    - [Other OSI approved licence]{.title-ref}
    - [OEEL-1]{.title-ref} (Odoo Enterprise Edition License v1.0)
    - [OPL-1]{.title-ref} (Odoo Proprietary License v1.0)
    - [Other proprietary]{.title-ref}

`category` (`str`, default: `Uncategorized`)

:   classification category within Odoo, rough business domain for the
    module.

    Although using [existing
    categories](%7BGITHUB_PATH%7D/odoo/addons/base/data/ir_module_category_data.xml)
    is recommended, the field is freeform and unknown categories are
    created on-the-fly. Category hierarchies can be created using the
    separator `/` e.g. `Foo / Bar` will create a category `Foo`, a
    category `Bar` as child category of `Foo`, and will set `Bar` as the
    module\'s category.

`depends` (`list(str)`)

:   Odoo modules which must be loaded before this one, either because
    this module uses features they create or because it alters resources
    they define.

    When a module is installed, all of its dependencies are installed
    before it. Likewise dependencies are loaded before a module is
    loaded.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Module [base]{.title-ref} is always installed in any Odoo instance. But
you still need to specify it as dependency to make sure your module is
updated when [base]{.title-ref} is updated.
::::

`data` (`list(str)`)

:   List of data files which must always be installed or updated with
    the module. A list of paths from the module root directory

`demo` (`list(str)`)

:   List of data files which are only installed or updated in
    *demonstration mode*

`auto_install` (`bool` or `list(str)`, default: `False`)

:   If `True`, this module will automatically be installed if all of its
    dependencies are installed.

    It is generally used for \"link modules\" implementing synergetic
    integration between two otherwise independent modules.

    For instance `sale_crm` depends on both `sale` and `crm` and is set
    to `auto_install`. When both `sale` and `crm` are installed, it
    automatically adds CRM campaigns tracking to sale orders without
    either `sale` or `crm` being aware of one another.

    If it is a list, it must contain a subset of the dependencies. This
    module will automatically be installed as soon as all the
    dependencies in the subset are installed. The remaining dependencies
    will be automatically installed as well. If the list is empty, this
    module will always be automatically installed regardless of its
    dependencies and these will be installed as well.

`external_dependencies` (`dict(key=list(str))`)

:   A dictionary containing python and/or binary dependencies.

    For python dependencies, the `python` key must be defined for this
    dictionary and a list of python modules to be imported should be
    assigned to it.

    For binary dependencies, the `bin` key must be defined for this
    dictionary and a list of binary executable names should be assigned
    to it.

    The module won\'t be installed if either the python module is not
    installed in the host machine or the binary executable is not found
    within the host machine\'s PATH environment variable.

`application` (`bool`, default: `False`)

:   Whether the module should be considered as a fully-fledged
    application (`True`) or is just a technical module (`False`) that
    provides some extra functionality to an existing application module.

`assets` (`dict`)

:   A definition of how all static files are loaded in various assets
    bundles. See the `assets <reference/assets>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} page for more details on how to describe bundles.

`installable` (`bool` default: `True`)

:   Whether a user should be able to install the module from the Web UI
    or not.

`maintainer` (`str`)

:   Person or entity in charge of the maintenance of this module, by
    default it is assumed that the author is the maintainer.

`{pre_init, post_init, uninstall}_hook` (`str`)

:   Hooks for module installation/uninstallation, their value should be
    a string representing the name of a function defined inside the
    module\'s `__init__.py`.

    `pre_init_hook` takes an env as its only argument, this function is
    executed prior to the module\'s installation.

    `post_init_hook` takes an env as its only argument, this function is
    executed right after the module\'s installation.

    `uninstall_hook` takes an env as its only argument, this function is
    executed after the module\'s uninstallation.

    These hooks should only be used when setup/cleanup required for this
    module is either extremely difficult or impossible through the api.

`active` (`bool`)

:   Deprecated. Replaced by `auto_install`.

- Add support for `GROUPING SETS` for pivot views. See
  [#194413](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/194413).
- Adding support for dynamic dates in domains. See
  [#216665](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/216665).
- Deprecated [odoo.osv]{.title-ref} in
  [#217708](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/217708).
- Deprecated [record.\_cr]{.title-ref}, [record.\_context]{.title-ref},
  [record.\_uid]{.title-ref} in
  [#193636](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/193636).

## Odoo Online version 18.4

  modules. See [#206408](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/206408).
- Possibility to write and combine custom domains for injecting
  arbitrary SQL. See
  [#205208](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/205208).

## Odoo Online version 18.3

- Domain optimization is applied before executing
  [Fields.search]{.title-ref} methods. All equalities are handled
  consistently: [=]{.title-ref} is equivalent to [in]{.title-ref}. See
  [#191549](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/191549).
- New cron API for notifying progress with batch commits. See
  [#197781](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/197781).
- Demo data no longer loaded by default. See
  [#194585](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/194585).

## Odoo Online version 18.2

- [read_group]{.title-ref} has been deprecated in favor of
  [\_read_group]{.title-ref} for backend usage and of
  [formatted_read_group]{.title-ref} as formatted public API. See
  [#163300](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/163300).
- [\@api.private]{.title-ref} is added to distinguish public Python
  methods from methods exposed for RPC calls. See
  [#195402](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/195402).
- Native namespaces for `odoo` module
  [PEP-420](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/). See
  [#195664](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/195664).

## Odoo Online version 18.1

- New [odoo.domain]{.title-ref} and [odoo.Domain]{.title-ref} API for
  domain manipulation. See
  [#170009](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/170009).
- Declare constraints and indexes as model attributes with
  [#175783](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/175783).
- The [json]{.title-ref} controllers have been renamed to
  [jsonrpc]{.title-ref}. They are called the same, only the
  [type]{.title-ref} in the python files changed. See
  [#183636](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/183636).

## Odoo version 18.0

- Searching by name is now implemented as
  [\_search_display_name]{.title-ref} like all other fields. See
  [#174967](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/174967).
- New methods to check access rights and rules now combine both access
  rights and rules: [check_access]{.title-ref}, [has_access]{.title-ref}
  and [\_filtered_access]{.title-ref}. See
  [#179148](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/179148).
- Translations are made available from the [Environment]{.title-ref}
  with [#174844](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/174844).

## Odoo Online version 17.4

- The internal operator [inselect]{.title-ref} is removed. The
  alternative is to use [in]{.title-ref} with a Query or SQL object.
  [#171371](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/171371).

## Odoo Online version 17.3

- We can now group by date parts numbers in [read_group]{.title-ref},
  [\_read_group]{.title-ref} and domains with
  [#159528](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/159528).

## Odoo Online version 17.2

- The `group_operator`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} attribute of
  `~odoo.fields.Field`{.interpreted-text role="class"} is renamed into
  `aggregator`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} with
  [#127353](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/127353).
- We can now group/aggregate/order by related no-store field with
  [#127353](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/127353).

## Odoo Online version 17.1

- Method `~odoo.models.Model._flush_search`{.interpreted-text
  role="meth"} has been deprecated with
  [#144747](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/144747). The flushing of
  fields is now done by
  `~odoo.api.Environment.execute_query`{.interpreted-text role="meth"},
  and is based on metadata put in the
  `~odoo.tools.SQL`{.interpreted-text role="class"} object by
  `~odoo.models.BaseModel._search`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} and
  other low-level ORM methods that build such objects. Those methods are
  also responsible for checking the access rights on the fields that are
  used in the SQL object.

## Odoo version 17.0

- Introduce an `~odoo.tools.SQL`{.interpreted-text role="class"} wrapper
  object to make SQL composition easier and safer with respect to SQL
  injections. Methods of the ORM now use it internally. Introduced by
  [#134677](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/134677).

## Odoo Online version 16.4

- Method `~odoo.models.Model.name_get`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}
  has been deprecated with
  [#122085](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/122085). Read field
  [display_name]{.title-ref} instead.

## Odoo Online version 16.3

- Method `~odoo.models.Model._read_group`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}
  has a new signature with
  [#110737](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/110737)

## Odoo Online version 16.2

- Refactor the implementation of searching and reading methods to be
  able to combine both in a minimal number of SQL queries. We introduce
  two new methods `~odoo.models.Model.search_fetch`{.interpreted-text
  role="meth"} and `~odoo.models.Model.fetch`{.interpreted-text
  role="meth"} that take advantage of the combination. More details can
  be found on the pull request
  [#112126](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/112126).

## Odoo version 16.0

- Translations for translated fields are stored as JSONB values with
  [#97692](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/97692) and
  [#101115](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/101115). Code translations
  are no longer stored into the database. They become static and are
  extracted from the PO files when needed.
- `~odoo.models.Model.search_count`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} takes
  the `limit`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} argument into account with
  [#95589](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/95589). It limits the
  number of records to count, improving performance when a partial
  result is acceptable.

## Odoo Online version 15.4

- New API for flushing to the database and invalidating the cache with
  [#87527](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/87527). New methods have
  been added to [odoo.models.Model]{.title-ref} and
  [odoo.api.Environment]{.title-ref}, and are less confusing about what
  is actually done in each case. See the section
  `SQL Execution <reference/orm/sql>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

## Odoo Online version 15.3

- The argument [args]{.title-ref} is renamed to [domain]{.title-ref} for
  `~odoo.models.Model.search`{.interpreted-text role="meth"},
  `~odoo.models.Model.search_count`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} and
  `~odoo.models.Model._search`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}.
  [#83687](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83687)
- `~odoo.models.Model.filtered_domain`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}
  conserves the order of the current recordset.
  [#83687](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83687)
- `~odoo.models.Model.browse`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} does not
  accept `str`{.interpreted-text role="class"} as [ids]{.title-ref}.
  [#83687](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83687)
- The methods `~odoo.models.Model.fields_get_keys`{.interpreted-text
  role="meth"} and `~odoo.models.Model.get_xml_id`{.interpreted-text
  role="meth"} on `~odoo.models.Model`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
  are deprecated. [#83687](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83687)
- The method `~odoo.models.Model._mapped_cache`{.interpreted-text
  role="meth"} is removed.
  [#83687](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83687)
- Remove the `limit`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} attribute of
  `~odoo.fields.One2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"} and
  `~odoo.fields.Many2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"}.
  [#83687](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83687)

## Odoo Online version 15.2

- Specific index types on fields: With
  [#83274](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83274) and
  [#83015](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83015), developers can now
  define what type of indexes can be used on fields by PostgreSQL. See
  the `index property <reference/fields>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  of [odoo.fields.Field]{.title-ref}.
- The `_sequence`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} attribute of
  `~odoo.models.Model`{.interpreted-text role="class"} is removed. Odoo
  lets PostgreSQL use the default sequence of the primary key.
  [#82727](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/82727)
- The method `~odoo.models.Model._write`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}
  does not raise an error for non-existing records.
  [#82727](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/82727)
- The `column_format`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} and
  `deprecated`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} attributes of
  `~odoo.fields.Field`{.interpreted-text role="class"} are removed.
  [#82727](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/82727)

## Models[]{#reference/orm/models} {#reference/orm/model}

Model fields are defined as attributes on the model itself:

    from odoo import models, fields
    class AModel(models.Model):
        _name = 'a.model.name'

        field1 = fields.Char()

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

this means you cannot define a field and a method with the same name,
the last one will silently overwrite the former ones.
::::

By default, the field\'s label (user-visible name) is a capitalized
version of the field name, this can be overridden with the `string`
parameter. :

    field2 = fields.Integer(string="Field Label")

For the list of field types and parameters, see `the fields reference
<reference/fields>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Default values are defined as parameters on fields, either as a value:

    name = fields.Char(default="a value")

or as a function called to compute the default value, which should
return that value:

    def _default_name(self):
        return self.get_value()

    name = fields.Char(default=lambda self: self._default_name())

#### Date(time) Fields {#reference/fields/date}

`Dates <odoo.fields.Date>`{.interpreted-text role="class"} and
`Datetimes <odoo.fields.Datetime>`{.interpreted-text role="class"} are
very important fields in any kind of business application. Their misuse
can create invisible yet painful bugs, this section aims to provide Odoo
developers with the knowledge required to avoid misusing these fields.

When assigning a value to a Date/Datetime field, the following options
are valid:

- A [date]{.title-ref} or [datetime]{.title-ref} object.
- A string in the proper server format:
  - `YYYY-MM-DD` for `~odoo.fields.Date`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
    fields,
  - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` for `~odoo.fields.Datetime`{.interpreted-text
    role="class"} fields.
- [False]{.title-ref} or [None]{.title-ref}.

The Date and Datetime fields class have helper methods to attempt
conversion into a compatible type:

- `~odoo.fields.Date.to_date`{.interpreted-text role="func"} will
  convert to a `datetime.date`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
- `~odoo.fields.Datetime.to_datetime`{.interpreted-text role="func"}
  will convert to a `datetime.datetime`{.interpreted-text role="class"}.

::: example
To parse date/datetimes coming from external sources:

    fields.Date.to_date(self._context.get('date_from'))
:::

Date / Datetime comparison best practices:

- Date fields can **only** be compared to date objects.
- Datetime fields can **only** be compared to datetime objects.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Strings representing dates and datetimes can be compared between each
other, however the result may not be the expected result, as a datetime
string will always be greater than a date string, therefore this
practice is **heavily** discouraged.
::::

Common operations with dates and datetimes such as addition, subtraction
or fetching the start/end of a period are exposed through both
`~odoo.fields.Date`{.interpreted-text role="class"} and
`~odoo.fields.Datetime`{.interpreted-text role="class"}. These helpers
are also available by importing [odoo.tools.date_utils]{.title-ref}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Timezones

Datetime fields are stored as [timestamp without timezone]{.title-ref}
columns in the database and are stored in the UTC timezone. This is by
design, as it makes the Odoo database independent from the timezone of
the hosting server system. Timezone conversion is managed entirely by
the client side.

#### Computed Fields {#reference/fields/compute}

Fields can be computed (instead of read straight from the database)
using the `compute` parameter. **It must assign the computed value to
the field**. If it uses the values of other *fields*, it should specify
those fields using `~odoo.api.depends`{.interpreted-text role="func"}. :

    from odoo import api
    total = fields.Float(compute='_compute_total')

    @api.depends('value', 'tax')
    def _compute_total(self):
        for record in self:
            record.total = record.value + record.value * record.tax

- dependencies can be dotted paths when using sub-fields:

      @api.depends('line_ids.value')
      def _compute_total(self):
          for record in self:
              record.total = sum(line.value for line in record.line_ids)

- computed fields are not stored by default, they are computed and
  returned when requested. Setting `store=True` will store them in the
  database and automatically enable searching and grouping. Note that by
  default, `compute_sudo=True` is set on the field.

- searching on a computed field can also be enabled by setting the
  `search` parameter. The value is a method name returning a
  `reference/orm/domains`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. :

      upper_name = field.Char(compute='_compute_upper', search='_search_upper')

      def _search_upper(self, operator, value):
          if operator == 'like':
              operator = 'ilike'
          return Domain('name', operator, value)

- computed fields are readonly by default. To allow *setting* values on
  a computed field, use the `inverse` parameter. It is the name of a
  function reversing the computation and setting the relevant fields:

      document = fields.Char(compute='_get_document', inverse='_set_document')

      def _get_document(self):
          for record in self:
              with open(record.get_document_path) as f:
                  record.document = f.read()
      def _set_document(self):
          for record in self:
              if not record.document: continue
              with open(record.get_document_path()) as f:
                  f.write(record.document)

- multiple fields can be computed at the same time by the same method,
  just use the same method on all fields and set all of them:

      discount_value = fields.Float(compute='_apply_discount')
      total = fields.Float(compute='_apply_discount')

      @api.depends('value', 'discount')
      def _apply_discount(self):
          for record in self:
              # compute actual discount from discount percentage
              discount = record.value * record.discount
              record.discount_value = discount
              record.total = record.value - discount

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

While it is possible to use the same compute method for multiple fields,
it is not recommended to do the same for the inverse method.

During the computation of the inverse, **all** fields that use said
inverse are protected, meaning that they can\'t be computed, even if
their value is not in the cache.

If any of those fields is accessed and its value is not in cache, the
ORM will simply return a default value of [False]{.title-ref} for these
fields. This means that the value of the inverse fields (other than the
one triggering the inverse method) may not give their correct value and
this will probably break the expected behavior of the inverse method.
::::

#### Related fields {#reference/fields/related}

A special case of computed fields are *related* (proxy) fields, which
provide the value of a sub-field on the current record. They are defined
by setting the `related` parameter and like regular computed fields they
can be stored:

    nickname = fields.Char(related='user_id.partner_id.name', store=True)

The value of a related field is given by following a sequence of
relational fields and reading a field on the reached model. The complete
sequence of fields to traverse is specified by the `related` attribute.

Some field attributes are automatically copied from the source field if
they are not redefined: `string`, `help`, `required` (only if all fields
in the sequence are required), `groups`, `digits`, `size`, `translate`,
`sanitize`, `selection`, `comodel_name`, `domain`, `context`. All
semantic-free attributes are copied from the source field.

By default, related fields are:

- not stored
- not copied
- readonly
- computed in superuser mode

Add the attribute `store=True` to make it stored, just like computed
fields. Related fields are automatically recomputed when their
dependencies are modified.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can specify precise field dependencies if you don\'t want the
related field to be recomputed on any dependency change:

    nickname = fields.Char(
        related='partner_id.name', store=True,
        depends=['partner_id'])
    # The nickname will only be recomputed when the partner_id
    # is modified, not when the name is modified on the partner.
::::

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

You cannot chain `~odoo.fields.Many2many`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} or `~odoo.fields.One2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
fields in `related` fields dependencies.

`related` can be used to refer to a
`~odoo.fields.One2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"} or
`~odoo.fields.Many2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"} field on
another model on the condition that it\'s done through a `Many2one`
relation on the current model. `One2many` and `Many2many` are not
supported and the results will not be aggregated correctly:

    m2o_id = fields.Many2one()
    m2m_ids = fields.Many2many()
    o2m_ids = fields.One2many()

    # Supported
    d_ids = fields.Many2many(related="m2o_id.m2m_ids")
    e_ids = fields.One2many(related="m2o_id.o2m_ids")

    # Won't work: use a custom Many2many computed field instead
    f_ids = fields.Many2many(related="m2m_ids.m2m_ids")

### Reserved Field names {#reference/orm/fields/reserved}

A few field names are reserved for pre-defined behaviors beyond that of
automated fields. They should be defined on a model when the related
behavior is desired:

::: attribute
Model.name

default value for `~odoo.models.BaseModel._rec_name`{.interpreted-text
role="attr"}, used to display records in context where a representative
\"naming\" is necessary.

`~odoo.fields.Char`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

::::: attribute
Model.active

toggles the global visibility of the record, if `active` is set to
`False` the record is invisible in most searches and listing.

Model.parent_path

When `~._parent_store`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} is set to True,
used to store a value reflecting the tree structure of
`~._parent_name`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}, and to optimize the
operators `child_of` and `parent_of` in
`reference/orm/domains`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. It must be
declared with `index=True` for proper operation.

`~odoo.fields.Char`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
:::

::: attribute
Model.company_id

Main field name used for Odoo multi-company behavior.

Used by [:meth:\~odoo.models.\_check_company]{.title-ref} to check multi
company consistency. Defines whether a record is shared between
companies (no value) or only accessible by the users of a given company.

`~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"} :type:
`~odoo.addons.base.models.res_company`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
:::

## Constraints and indexes

Similarly to fields, you can declare
`~odoo.models.Constraint`{.interpreted-text role="attr"},
`~odoo.models.Index`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} and
`~odoo.models.UniqueIndex`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}. The name of
the attribute must begin with [\_]{.title-ref} to avoid name clashes
with field names.

You can customize error messages. They can either be strings and their
translation will be provided in the internal reflected constraint table.
Otherwise, they can be functions that take [(env, diag)]{.title-ref} as
parameters which respectively denote the environment and psycopg
diagnostics.

::: example
``` python
class AModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'a.model'
    _my_check = models.Constraint("CHECK (x > y)", "x > y is not true")
    _name_idx = models.Index("(last_name, first_name)")
```
:::

## Recordsets

Interactions with models and records are performed through recordsets,
an ordered collection of records of the same model.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Contrary to what the name implies, it is currently possible for
recordsets to contain duplicates. This may change in the future.
::::

Methods defined on a model are executed on a recordset, and their `self`
is a recordset:

    class AModel(models.Model):
        _name = 'a.model'
        def a_method(self):
            # self can be anything between 0 records and all records in the
            # database
            self.do_operation()

Iterating on a recordset will yield new sets of *a single record*
(\"singletons\"), much like iterating on a Python string yields strings
of a single characters:

    def do_operation(self):
        print(self) # => a.model(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
        for record in self:
            print(record) # => a.model(1), then a.model(2), then a.model(3), ...

### Field access

Recordsets provide an \"Active Record\" interface: model fields can be
read and written directly from the record as attributes.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When accessing non-relational fields on a recordset of potentially
multiple records, use `~odoo.models.BaseModel.mapped`{.interpreted-text
role="meth"}:

    total_qty = sum(self.mapped('qty'))
::::

Field values can also be accessed like dict items, which is more elegant
and safer than `getattr()` for dynamic field names. Setting a field\'s
value triggers an update to the database:

    >>> record.name
    Example Name
    >>> record.company_id.name
    Company Name
    >>> record.name = "Bob"
    >>> field = "name"
    >>> record[field]
    Bob

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Trying to read a field on multiple records will raise an error for non
relational fields.
::::

Accessing a relational field (`~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text
role="class"}, `~odoo.fields.One2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"},
`~odoo.fields.Many2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"}) *always*
returns a recordset, empty if the field is not set.

### Record cache and prefetching

Odoo maintains a cache for the fields of the records, so that not every
field access issues a database request, which would be terrible for
performance. The following example queries the database only for the
first statement:

    record.name             # first access reads value from database
    record.name             # second access gets value from cache

To avoid reading one field on one record at a time, Odoo *prefetches*
records and fields following some heuristics to get good performance.
Once a field must be read on a given record, the ORM actually reads that
field on a larger recordset, and stores the returned values in cache for
later use. The prefetched recordset is usually the recordset from which
the record comes by iteration. Moreover, all simple stored fields
(boolean, integer, float, char, text, date, datetime, selection,
many2one) are fetched altogether; they correspond to the columns of the
model\'s table, and are fetched efficiently in the same query.

Consider the following example, where `partners` is a recordset of 1000
records. Without prefetching, the loop would make 2000 queries to the
database. With prefetching, only one query is made:

    for partner in partners:
        print partner.name          # first pass prefetches 'name' and 'lang'
                                    # (and other fields) on all 'partners'
        print partner.lang

The prefetching also works on *secondary records*: when relational
fields are read, their values (which are records) are subscribed for
future prefetching. Accessing one of those secondary records prefetches
all secondary records from the same model. This makes the following
example generate only two queries, one for partners and one for
countries:

    countries = set()
    for partner in partners:
        country = partner.country_id        # first pass prefetches all partners
        countries.add(country.name)         # first pass prefetches all countries

::: seealso
The methods `~odoo.models.Model.search_fetch`{.interpreted-text
role="meth"} and `~odoo.models.Model.fetch`{.interpreted-text
role="meth"} can be used to populate the cache of records, typically in
cases where the prefetching mechanism does not work well.

### SQL Execution {#reference/orm/sql}

The `~odoo.api.Environment.cr`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} attribute
on environments is the cursor for the current database transaction and
allows executing SQL directly, either for queries which are difficult to
express using the ORM (e.g. complex joins) or for performance reasons:

    self.env.cr.execute("some_sql", params)

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Executing raw SQL bypasses the ORM and, by consequent, Odoo security
rules. Please make sure your queries are sanitized when using user input
and prefer using ORM utilities if you don\'t really need to use SQL
queries.
::::

The recommended way to build SQL queries is to use the wrapper object

::::: autoclass
odoo.tools.SQL

::: automethod
SQL.join
:::

::: automethod
SQL.identifier
:::
:::::

One important thing to know about models is that they don\'t necessarily
perform database updates right away. Indeed, for performance reasons,
the framework delays the recomputation of fields after modifying
records. And some database updates are delayed, too. Therefore, before
querying the database, one has to make sure that it contains the
relevant data for the query. This operation is called *flushing* and
performs the expected database updates.

::: example
``` python
# make sure that 'partner_id' is up-to-date in database
self.env['model'].flush_model(['partner_id'])

self.env.cr.execute(SQL("SELECT id FROM model WHERE partner_id IN %s", ids))
ids = [row[0] for row in self.env.cr.fetchall()]
```
:::

Before every SQL query, one has to flush the data needed for that query.
There are three levels for flushing, each with its own API. One can
flush either everything, all the records of a model, or some specific
records. Because delaying updates improves performance in general, we
recommend to be *specific* when flushing.

::: automethod
odoo.api.Environment.flush_all
:::

::: automethod
Model.flush_model
:::

::: automethod
Model.flush_recordset
:::

Because models use the same cursor and the
`~odoo.api.Environment`{.interpreted-text role="class"} holds various
caches, these caches must be invalidated when *altering* the database in
raw SQL, or further uses of models may become incoherent. It is
necessary to clear caches when using `CREATE`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` in
SQL, but not `SELECT` (which simply reads the database).

::: example
``` python
# make sure 'state' is up-to-date in database
self.env['model'].flush_model(['state'])

self.env.cr.execute("UPDATE model SET state=%s WHERE state=%s", ['new', 'old'])

# invalidate 'state' from the cache
self.env['model'].invalidate_model(['state'])
```
:::

Just like flushing, one can invalidate either the whole cache, the cache
of all the records of a model, or the cache of specific records. One can
even invalidate specific fields on some records or all records of a
model. As the cache improves performance in general, we recommend to be
*specific* when invalidating.

::: automethod
odoo.api.Environment.invalidate_all
:::

::: automethod
Model.invalidate_model
:::

::: automethod
Model.invalidate_recordset
:::

The methods above keep the caches and the database consistent with each
other. However, if computed field dependencies have been modified in the
database, one has to inform the models for the computed fields to be
recomputed. The only thing the framework needs to know is *what* fields
have changed on *which* records.

::: example
``` python
# make sure 'state' is up-to-date in database
self.env['model'].flush_model(['state'])

# use the RETURNING clause to retrieve which rows have changed
self.env.cr.execute("UPDATE model SET state=%s WHERE state=%s RETURNING id", ['new', 'old'])
ids = [row[0] for row in self.env.cr.fetchall()]

# invalidate the cache, and notify the update to the framework
records = self.env['model'].browse(ids)
records.invalidate_recordset(['state'])
records.modified(['state'])
```
:::

One has to figure out which records have been modified. There are many
ways to do this, possibly involving extra SQL queries. In the example
above, we take advantage of the `RETURNING` clause of PostgreSQL to
retrieve the information without an extra query. After making the cache
consistent by invalidation, invoke the method `modified` on the modified
records with the fields that have been updated.

#### Fields

::: automethod
Model.fields_get
:::

#### Search domains {#reference/orm/domains}

A search domain is a first-order logical predicate used for filtering
and searching recordsets. You combine simple conditions on a field
expression with logical operators.

`~odoo.fields.Domain`{.interpreted-text role="class"} can be used as a
builder for domains.

``` python
# simple condition domains
d1 = Domain('name', '=', 'abc')
d2 = Domain('phone', 'like', '7620')

# combine domains
d3 = d1 & d2  # and
d4 = d1 | d2  # or
d5 = ~d1      # not

# combine and parse multiple domains (any iterable of domains)
Domain.AND([d1, d2, d3, ...])
Domain.OR([d4, d5, ...])

# constants
Domain.TRUE   # true domain
Domain.FALSE  # false domain
```

A domain can be a simple condition `(field_expr, operator, value)`
where:

- 

  `field_expr` (`str`)

  :   a field name of the current model, or a relationship traversal
      through a `~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
      using dot-notation e.g. `'street'` or `'partner_id.country'`. If
      the field is a date(time) field, you can also specify a part of
      the date using `'field_name.granularity'`. The supported
      granularities are `'year_number'`, `'quarter_number'`,
      `'month_number'`, `'iso_week_number'`, `'day_of_week'`,
      `'day_of_month'`, `'day_of_year'`, `'hour_number'`,
      `'minute_number'`, `'second_number'`. They all use an integer as
      value.

- 

  `operator` (`str`)

  :   an operator used to compare the `field_expr` with the `value`.
      Valid operators are:

      `=`

      :   equals to

      `!=`

      :   not equals to

      `>`

      :   greater than

      `>=`

      :   greater than or equal to

      `<`

      :   less than

      `<=`

      :   less than or equal to

      `=?`

      :   unset or equals to (returns true if `value` is either `None`
          or `False`, otherwise behaves like `=`)

      `=like` (and `not =like`)

      :   matches `field_expr` against the `value` pattern. An
          underscore `_` in the pattern stands for (matches) any single
          character; a percent sign `%` matches any string of zero or
          more characters.

      `like` (and `not like`)

      :   matches `field_expr` against the `%value%` pattern. Similar to
          `=like` but wraps `value` with \'%\' before matching

      `ilike` (and `not ilike`)

      :   case insensitive `like`

      `=ilike` (and `not =ilike`)

      :   case insensitive `=like`

      `in` (and `not in`)

      :   is equal to any of the items from `value`, `value` should be a
          collection of items

      `child_of`

      :   is a child (descendant) of a `value` record (value can be
          either one item or a list of items).

          Takes the semantics of the model into account (i.e following
          the relationship field named by
          `~odoo.models.Model._parent_name`{.interpreted-text
          role="attr"}).

      `parent_of`

      :   is a parent (ascendant) of a `value` record (value can be
          either one item or a list of items).

          Takes the semantics of the model into account (i.e following
          the relationship field named by
          `~odoo.models.Model._parent_name`{.interpreted-text
          role="attr"}).

      `any` (and `not any`)

      :   matches if any record in the relationship traversal through
          `field_expr` (`~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text
          role="class"}, `~odoo.fields.One2many`{.interpreted-text
          role="class"}, or `~odoo.fields.Many2many`{.interpreted-text
          role="class"}) satisfies the provided domain `value`. The
          `field_expr` should be a field name.

      `any!` (and `not any!`)

      :   like `any`, but bypasses access checks.

- 

  `value`

  :   variable type, must be comparable (through `operator`) to the
      named field.

::: example
To search for partners named *ABC*, with a phone or mobile number
containing *7620*:

    Domain('name', '=', 'ABC') & (
      Domain('phone', 'ilike', '7620') | Domain('mobile', 'ilike', '7620')
    )

To search sales orders to invoice that have at least one line with a
product that is out of stock:

    Domain('invoice_status', '=', 'to invoice') \
      & Domain('order_line', 'any', Domain('product_id.qty_available', '<=', 0))

To search for all partners born in the month of February:

    Domain('birthday.month_number', '=', 2)
:::

`~odoo.fields.Domain`{.interpreted-text role="class"} can be used to
serialize the domain as a `list` of simple conditions represented by
3-item `tuple` (or a `list`). Such a serialized form may be sometimes
faster to read or write. Domain conditions can be combined using logical
operators in a *prefix* notation. You can combine 2 domains using `'&'`
(AND), `'|'` (OR) and you can negate 1 using `'!'` (NOT).

``` python
# parse a domain (from list to Domain)
domain = Domain([('name', '=', 'abc'), ('phone', 'like', '7620')])

# serialize domain as a list (from Domain to list)
domain_list = list(domain)
# will output:
# ['&', ('name', '=', 'abc'), ('phone', 'like', '7620')]
```

#### Dynamic time values {#reference/orm/dynamic_values}

In the context of search domains, for
`date and datetime fields <reference/fields/date>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, the value can be a moment relative to *now* in the timezone
of the user. A simple language is provided to specify these dates. It is
a space-separated string of terms. The first term is optional and is
\"today\" (at midnight) or \"now\". Then, each term starts with \"+\"
(add), \"-\" (subtract) or \"=\" (set), followed by an integer and date
unit or a lower-case weekday.

The date units are: \"d\" (days), \"w\" (weeks), \"m\" (months), \"y\"
(years), \"H\" (hours), \"M\" (minutes), \"S\" (seconds). For weekdays,
\"+\" and \"-\" mean next and previous weekday (unless we are already in
that weekday) and \"=\" means in current week starting on Monday. When
setting a date, the lower-units (hours, minutes and seconds) are set to
0.

::: example
``` python
Domain('some_date', '<', 'now')  # now
Domain('some_date', '<', 'today')  # today at midnight
Domain('some_date', '<', '-3d +1H')  # now - 3 days + 1 hour
Domain('some_date', '<', '=3H')  # today at 3:00:00
Domain('some_date', '<', '=5d')  # 5th day of current month at midnight
Domain('some_date', '<', '=1m')  # January, same day of month at midnight
Domain('some_date', '>=', '=monday -1w')  # Monday of the previous week

### Operations {#reference/orm/records/operations}

Recordsets are immutable, but sets of the same model can be combined
using various set operations, returning new recordsets.

- `record in set` returns whether `record` (which must be a 1-element
  recordset) is present in `set`. `record not in set` is the inverse
  operation
- `set1 <= set2` and `set1 < set2` return whether `set1` is a subset of
  `set2` (resp. strict)
- `set1 >= set2` and `set1 > set2` return whether `set1` is a superset
  of `set2` (resp. strict)
- `set1 | set2` returns the union of the two recordsets, a new recordset
  containing all records present in either source
- `set1 & set2` returns the intersection of two recordsets, a new
  recordset containing only records present in both sources
- `set1 - set2` returns a new recordset containing only records of
  `set1` which are *not* in `set2`

Recordsets are iterable so the usual Python tools are available for
transformation (`python:map`{.interpreted-text role="func"},
`python:sorted`{.interpreted-text role="func"},
`~python:itertools.ifilter`{.interpreted-text role="func"}, \...)
however these return either a `python:list`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} or an `python:iterator`{.interpreted-text role="term"},
removing the ability to call methods on their result, or to use set
operations.

Recordsets therefore provide the following operations returning
recordsets themselves (when possible):

## Inheritance and extension {#reference/orm/inheritance}

Odoo provides three different mechanisms to extend models in a modular
way:

- creating a new model from an existing one, adding new information to
  the copy but leaving the original module as-is
- extending models defined in other modules in-place, replacing the
  previous version
- delegating some of the model\'s fields to records it contains

![image](orm/inheritance_methods.png){.align-center}

### Classical inheritance

When using the `~odoo.models.Model._inherit`{.interpreted-text
role="attr"} and `~odoo.models.Model._name`{.interpreted-text
role="attr"} attributes together, Odoo creates a new model using the
existing one (provided via
`~odoo.models.Model._inherit`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}) as a base.
The new model gets all the fields, methods and meta-information
(defaults & al) from its base.

``` python
class Inheritance0(models.Model):
    _name = 'inheritance.0'
    _description = 'Inheritance Zero'

    name = fields.Char()

    def call(self):
        return self.check("model 0")

    def check(self, s):
        return "This is {} record {}".format(s, self.name)

class Inheritance1(models.Model):
    _name = 'inheritance.1'
    _inherit = ['inheritance.0']
    _description = 'Inheritance One'

    def call(self):
        return self.check("model 1")
```

and using them:

    a = env['inheritance.0'].create({'name': 'A'})
    b = env['inheritance.1'].create({'name': 'B'})

    a.call()
    b.call()

will yield:

> \"This is model 0 record A\" \"This is model 1 record B\"

the second model has inherited from the first model\'s `check` method
and its `name` field, but overridden the `call` method, as when using
standard `Python inheritance <python:tut-inheritance>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### Extension

When using `~odoo.models.Model._inherit`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}
but leaving out `~odoo.models.Model._name`{.interpreted-text
role="attr"}, the new model replaces the existing one, essentially
extending it in-place. This is useful to add new fields or methods to
existing models (created in other modules), or to customize or
reconfigure them (e.g. to change their default sort order)

``` python
class Extension0(models.Model):
    _name = 'extension.0'
    _description = 'Extension zero'

    name = fields.Char(default="A")

class Extension0(models.Model):
    _inherit = 'extension.0'

    description = fields.Char(default="Extended")
```

``` python3
record = env['extension.0'].create({})
record.read()[0]
```

will yield:

    {'name': "A", 'description': "Extended"}

:::: warning

role="attr"} is set to the same value, unless [\_name]{.title-ref} is
explicitly set.

It will also yield the various `automatic fields

### Delegation

The third inheritance mechanism provides more flexibility (it can be
altered at runtime) but less power: using the
`~odoo.models.Model._inherits`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} a model
*delegates* the lookup of any field not found on the current model to
\"children\" models. The delegation is performed via
`~odoo.fields.Reference`{.interpreted-text role="class"} fields
automatically set up on the parent model.

The main difference is in the meaning. When using Delegation, the model
**has one** instead of **is one**, turning the relationship in a
composition instead of inheritance

``` python
class Screen(models.Model):
    _name = 'delegation.screen'
    _description = 'Screen'

    size = fields.Float(string='Screen Size in inches')

class Keyboard(models.Model):
    _name = 'delegation.keyboard'
    _description = 'Keyboard'

    layout = fields.Char(string='Layout')

class Laptop(models.Model):
    _name = 'delegation.laptop'
    _description = 'Laptop'

    _inherits = {
        'delegation.screen': 'screen_id',
        'delegation.keyboard': 'keyboard_id',
    }

    name = fields.Char(string='Name')
    maker = fields.Char(string='Maker')

    # a Laptop has a screen
    screen_id = fields.Many2one('delegation.screen', required=True, ondelete="cascade")
    # a Laptop has a keyboard
    keyboard_id = fields.Many2one('delegation.keyboard', required=True, ondelete="cascade")
```

``` python3
record = env['delegation.laptop'].create({
    'screen_id': env['delegation.screen'].create({'size': 13.0}).id,
    'keyboard_id': env['delegation.keyboard'].create({'layout': 'QWERTY'}).id,
})
record.size
record.layout
```

will result in:

    13.0
    'QWERTY'

and it\'s possible to write directly on the delegated field:

    record.write({'size': 14.0})

- [\_inherits]{.title-ref} is more or less implemented, avoid it if you

### Fields Incremental Definition

A field is defined as class attribute on a model class. If the model is
extended, one can also extend the field definition by redefining a field
with the same name and same type on the subclass. In that case, the
attributes of the field are taken from the parent class and overridden
by the ones given in subclasses.

For instance, the second class below only adds a tooltip on the field
`state`

``` python
class FirstFoo(models.Model):
    state = fields.Selection([...], required=True)

class FirstFoo(models.Model):
    _inherit = ['first.foo']
    state = fields.Selection(help="Blah blah blah")

class WrongFirstFooClassName(models.Model):
    _name = 'first.foo'  # force the model name
    _inherit = ['first.foo']
    state = fields.Selection(help="Blah blah blah")
```

# Performance

## Profiling {#performance/profiling}

::: currentmodule
odoo.tools.profiler
:::

Profiling is about analysing the execution of a program and measure
aggregated data. These data can be the elapsed time for each function,
the executed SQL queries\...

While profiling does not improve the performance of a program by itself,
it can prove very helpful in finding performance issues and identifying
which part of the program is responsible for them.

Odoo provides an integrated profiling tool that allows recording all
executed queries and stack traces during execution. It can be used to
profile either a set of requests of a user session, or a specific
portion of code. Profiling results can be either inspected with the
integrated [speedscope](https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope)
`open source app allowing to visualize a flamegraph`{.interpreted-text
role="dfn"} view or analyzed with custom tools by first saving them in a
JSON file or in the database.

### Enable the profiler {#performance/profiling/enable}

The profiler can either be enabled from the user interface, which is the
easiest way to do so but allows profiling only web requests, or from
Python code, which allows profiling any piece of code including tests.

:::::::::::::::: tabs
::::: tab
Enable from the user interface

1.  `Enable the developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

2.  Before starting a profiling session, the profiler must be enabled
    globally on the database. This can be done in two ways:

    - Open the
      `developer mode tools <developer-mode/tools>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"}, then toggle the `Enable profiling`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"} button. A wizard suggests a set of expiry times
      for the profiling. Click on `ENABLE PROFILING`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"} to enable the profiler globally.

      ![image](performance/enable_profiling_wizard.png)

    - Go to
      `Settings --> General Settings --> Performance`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"} and set the desired time to the field
      `Enable profiling until`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

3.  After the profiler is enabled on the database, users can enable it
    on their session. To do so, toggle the
    `Enable profiling`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the
    `developer mode tools
    <developer-mode/tools>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} again. By
    default, the recommended options `Record
    sql`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
    `Record traces`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are enabled. To
    learn more about the different options, head over to
    `performance/profiling/collectors`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

    ![image](performance/profiling_debug_menu.png)

When the profiler is enabled, all the requests made to the server are
profiled and saved into an [ir.profile]{.title-ref} record. Such records
are grouped into the current profiling session which spans from when the
profiler was enabled until it is disabled.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Odoo Online databases cannot be profiled.
::::
:::::

:::::::::::: tab
Enable from Python code

Starting the profiler manually can be convenient to profile a specific
method or a part of the code. This code can be a test, a compute method,
the entire loading, etc.

To start the profiler from Python code, call it as a context manager.
You may specify *what* you want to record through the parameters. A
shortcut is available for profiling test classes: `self.profile()`. See
`performance/profiling/collectors`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for
more information on the [collectors]{.title-ref} parameter.

::: example
``` python
with Profiler():
    do_stuff()
```
:::

::: example
``` python
with Profiler(collectors=['sql', PeriodicCollector(interval=0.1)]):
    do_stuff()
```
:::

::::: example
``` python
with self.profile():
    with self.assertQueryCount(__system__=1211):
        do_stuff()
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The profiler is called outside of the [assertQueryCount]{.title-ref} in
order to catch queries made when exiting the context manager (e.g.,
flush).
::::
:::::

::: {.autoclass special-members="__init__"}
Profiler()
:::

When the profiler is enabled, all executions of a test method are
profiled and saved into an [ir.profile]{.title-ref} record. Such records
are grouped into a single profiling session. This is especially useful
when using the `@warmup` and `@users` decorators.

::::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

It can be complicated to analyze profiling results of a method that is
called several times because all the calls are grouped together in the
stack trace. Add an **execution context** as a context manager to break
down the results into multiple frames.

::: example
``` python
for index in range(max_index):
    with ExecutionContext(current_index=index):  # Identify each call in speedscope results.
        do_stuff()
```
:::
:::::
::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::

### Analyse the results {#performance/profiling/analyse}

To browse the profiling results, make sure that the
`profiler is enabled globally on the
database <performance/profiling/enable>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
then open the `developer mode tools
<developer-mode/tools>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and click on the
button in the top-right corner of the profiling section. A list view of
the [ir.profile]{.title-ref} records grouped by profiling session opens.

![image](performance/profiling_web.png){.align-center}

Each record has a clickable link that opens the speedscope results in a
new tab.

![image](performance/flamegraph_example.png){.align-center}

Speedscope falls out of the scope of this documentation but there are a
lot of tools to try: search, highlight of similar frames, zoom on frame,
timeline, left heavy, sandwich view\...

Depending on the profiling options that were activated, Odoo generates
different view modes that you can access from the top menu.

![image](performance/speedscope_modes.png){.align-center}

- The `Combined`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view shows all the
  SQL queries and traces merged togethers.
- The `Combined no context`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view
  shows the same result but ignores the saved execution context
  \<performance/profiling/enable\>\`.
- The `sql (no gap)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view shows all
  the SQL queries as if they were executed one after another, without
  any Python logic. This is useful for optimizing SQL only.
- The `sql (density)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view shows only
  all the SQL queries, leaving gap between them. This can be useful to
  spot if eiter SQL or Python code is the problem, and to identify zones
  in where many small queries could be batched.
- The `frames`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view shows the results
  of only the `periodic collector
  <performance/profiling/collectors/periodic>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Even though the profiler has been designed to be as light as possible,
it can still impact performance, especially when using the
`Sync collector
<performance/profiling/collectors/sync>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
Keep that in mind when analyzing speedscope results.
::::

### Collectors {#performance/profiling/collectors}

Whereas the profiler is about the *when* of profiling, the collectors
take care of the *what*.

Each collector specializes in collecting profiling data in its own
format and manner. They can be individually enabled from the user
interface through their dedicated toggle button in the
`developer mode tools <developer-mode/tools>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, or from Python code through their key or class.

There are currently four collectors available in Odoo:

  Name                                                                                             Toggle button                                        Python key                   Python class
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------- ---------------------------------
  `SQL collector <performance/profiling/collectors/sql>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}             `Record sql`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}      [sql]{.title-ref}            [SqlCollector]{.title-ref}
  `Periodic collector <performance/profiling/collectors/periodic>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}   `Record traces`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}   [traces_async]{.title-ref}   [PeriodicCollector]{.title-ref}
  `QWeb collector <performance/profiling/collectors/qweb>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}           `Record qweb`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}     [qweb]{.title-ref}           [QwebCollector]{.title-ref}
  `Sync collector <performance/profiling/collectors/sync>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}           No                                                   [traces_sync]{.title-ref}    [SyncCollector]{.title-ref}

By default, the profiler enables the SQL and the Periodic collectors.
Both when it is enabled from the user interface or Python code.

#### SQL collector {#performance/profiling/collectors/sql}

The SQL collector saves all the SQL queries made to the database in the
current thread (for all cursors), as well as the stack trace. The
overhead of the collector is added to the analysed thread for each
query, which means that using it on a lot of small queries may impact
execution time and other profilers.

It is especially useful to debug query counts, or to add information to
the `Periodic collector
<performance/profiling/collectors/periodic>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} in the combined speedscope view.

::: autoclass
SQLCollector
:::

#### Periodic collector {#performance/profiling/collectors/periodic}

This collector runs in a separate thread and saves the stack trace of
the analysed thread at every interval. The interval (by default 10 ms)
can be defined through the `Interval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option in the user interface, or the [interval]{.title-ref} parameter in
Python code.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

If the interval is set at a very low value, profiling long requests will
generate memory issues. If the interval is set at a very high value,
information on short function executions will be lost.
::::

It is one of the best way to analyse performance as it should have a
very low impact on the execution time thanks to its separate thread.

::: autoclass
PeriodicCollector
:::

#### QWeb collector {#performance/profiling/collectors/qweb}

This collector saves the Python execution time and queries of all
directives. As for the `SQL
collector <performance/profiling/collectors/sql>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, the overhead can be important when executing a lot of small
directives. The results are different from other collectors in terms of
collected data, and can be analysed from the [ir.profile]{.title-ref}
form view using a custom widget.

It is mainly useful for optimizing views.

::: autoclass
QwebCollector
:::

#### Sync collector {#performance/profiling/collectors/sync}

This collector saves the stack for every function\'s call and return and
runs on the same thread, which greatly impacts performance.

It can be useful to debug and understand complex flows, and follow their
execution in the code. It is however not recommended for performance
analysis because the overhead is high.

::: autoclass
SyncCollector
:::

### Performance pitfalls {#performance/profiling/pitfalls}

- Be careful with randomness. Multiple executions may lead to different
  results. E.g., a garbage collector being triggered during execution.
- Be careful with blocking calls. In some cases, external
  [c_call]{.title-ref} may take some time before releasing the GIL, thus
  leading to unexpected long frames with the `Periodic collector
  <performance/profiling/collectors/periodic>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}. This should be detected by the profiler and give a
  warning. It is possible to trigger the profiler manually before such
  calls if needed.
- Pay attention to the cache. Profiling before that the
  [view]{.title-ref}/\`assets\`/\... are in cache can lead to different
  results.
- Be aware of the profiler\'s overhead. The `SQL collector
  <performance/profiling/collectors/sql>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}\'s overhead can be important when a lot of small queries
  are executed. Profiling is practical to spot a problem but you may
  want to disable the profiler in order to measure the real impact of a
  code change.
- Profiling results can be memory intensive. In some cases (e.g.,
  profiling an install or a long request), it is possible that you reach
  memory limit, especially when rendering the speedscope results, which
  can lead to an HTTP 500 error. In this case, you may need to start the
  server with a higher memory limit: [\--limit-memory-hard
  \$((8\*1024\*\*3))]{.title-ref}.

## Good practices {#performance/good_practices}

### Batch operations {#performance/good_practices/batch}

When working with recordsets, it is almost always better to batch
operations.

::::::: example
Don\'t call a method that runs SQL queries while looping over a
recordset because it will do so for each record of the set.

::: rst-class
bad-example
:::

``` python
def _compute_count(self):
    for record in self:
        domain = [('related_id', '=', record.id)]
        record.count = other_model.search_count(domain)
```

Instead, replace the [search_count]{.title-ref} with a
[\_read_group]{.title-ref} to execute one SQL query for the entire batch
of records.

::: rst-class
good-example
:::

``` python
def _compute_count(self):
    domain = [('related_id', 'in', self.ids)]
    counts_data = other_model._read_group(domain, ['related_id'], ['__count'])
    mapped_data = dict(counts_data)
    for record in self:
        record.count = mapped_data.get(record, 0)
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This example is not optimal nor correct in all cases. It is only a
substitute for a [search_count]{.title-ref}. Another solution could be
to prefetch and count the inverse [One2many]{.title-ref} field.
::::
:::::::

::::: example
Don\'t create records one after another.

::: rst-class
bad-example
:::

``` python
for name in ['foo', 'bar']:
    model.create({'name': name})
```

Instead, accumulate the create values and call the [create]{.title-ref}
method on the batch. Doing so has mostly no impact and helps the
framework optimize fields computation.

::: rst-class
good-example
:::

``` python
create_values = []
for name in ['foo', 'bar']:
    create_values.append({'name': name})
records = model.create(create_values)
```
:::::

::::: example
Fail to prefetch the fields of a recordset while browsing a single
record inside a loop.

::: rst-class
bad-example
:::

``` python
for record_id in record_ids:
    model.browse(record_id)
    record.foo  # One query is executed per record.
```

Instead, browse the entire recordset first.

::: rst-class
good-example
:::

``` python
records = model.browse(record_ids)
for record in records:
    record.foo  # One query is executed for the entire recordset.
```

We can verify that the records are prefetched in batch by reading the
field [prefetch_ids]{.title-ref} which includes each of the record
ids.browsing all records together is unpractical,

If needed, the [with_prefetch]{.title-ref} method can be used to disable
batch prefetching:

``` python
for values in values_list:
    message = self.browse(values['id']).with_prefetch(self.ids)
```
:::::

### Reduce the algorithmic complexity {#performance/good_practices/algorithmic_complexity}

Algorithmic complexity is a measure of how long an algorithm would take
to complete in regard to the size [n]{.title-ref} of the input. When the
complexity is high, the execution time can grow quickly as the input
becomes larger. In some cases, the algorithmic complexity can be reduced
by preparing the input\'s data correctly.

::::: example
For a given problem, let\'s consider a naive algorithm crafted with two
nested loops for which the complexity in in O(n²).

::: rst-class
bad-example
:::

``` python
for record in self:
    for result in results:
        if results['id'] == record.id:
            record.foo = results['foo']
            break
```

Assuming that all results have a different id, we can prepare the data
to reduce the complexity.

::: rst-class
good-example
:::

``` python
mapped_result = {result['id']: result['foo'] for result in results}
for record in self:
    record.foo = mapped_result.get(record.id)
```
:::::

:::::: example
Choosing the bad data structure to hold the input can lead to quadratic
complexity.

::: rst-class
bad-example
:::

``` python
invalid_ids = self.search(domain).ids
for record in self:
    if record.id in invalid_ids:
        ...
```

If [invalid_ids]{.title-ref} is a list-like data structure, the
complexity of the algorithm may be quadratic.

Instead, prefer using set operations like casting
[invalid_ids]{.title-ref} to a set.

::: rst-class
good-example
:::

``` python
invalid_ids = set(invalid_ids)
for record in self:
    if record.id in invalid_ids:
        ...
```

Depending on the input, recordset operations can also be used.

::: rst-class
good-example
:::

``` python
invalid_ids = self.search(domain)
for record in self - invalid_ids:
    ...
```
::::::

### Use indexes {#performance/good_practices/index}

Database indexes can help fasten search operations, be it from a search
in the or through the user interface.

``` python
name = fields.Char(string="Name", index=True)
```

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Be careful not to index every field as indexes consume space and impact
on performance when executing one of [INSERT]{.title-ref},
[UPDATE]{.title-ref}, and [DELETE]{.title-ref}.

# QWeb Reports[]{#reference/reports} {#reference/reports/report}

Reports are written in HTML/QWeb, like website views in Odoo. You can
use the usual
`QWeb control flow tools <reference/qweb>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. The PDF rendering itself is performed by
[wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org).

Reports are declared using a
`report action <reference/actions/report>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and a `reference/reports/templates`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for the action to use.

If useful or necessary, it is possible to specify a
`reference/reports/paper_formats`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for the
report report.

## Report template {#reference/reports/templates}

Report templates will always provide the following variables:

`time`

:   a reference to `python:time`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} from the
    Python standard library

`user`

:   `res.user` record for the user printing the report

`res_company`

:   record for the current `user`\'s company

`website`

:   the current website object, if any (this item can be present but
    `None`)

`web_base_url`

:   the base url for the webserver

`context_timestamp`

:   a function taking `python:datetime.datetime`{.interpreted-text
    role="class"} in UTC[^1] and converting it to the timezone of the
    user printing the report

### Minimal viable template

A minimal template would look like:

``` xml
<template id="report_invoice">
    <t t-call="web.html_container">
        <t t-foreach="docs" t-as="o">
            <t t-call="web.external_layout">
                <div class="page">
                    <h2>Report title</h2>
                    <p>This object's name is <span t-field="o.name"/></p>
                </div>
            </t>
        </t>
    </t>
</template>
```

Calling `external_layout` will add the default header and footer on your
report. The PDF body will be the content inside the
`<div class="page">`. The template\'s `id` must be the name specified in
the report declaration; for example `account.report_invoice` for the
above report. Since this is a QWeb template, you can access all the
fields of the `docs` objects received by the template.

By default, the rendering context will also expose the following items:

`docs`

:   records for the current report

`doc_ids`

:   list of ids for the `docs` records

`doc_model`

:   model for the `docs` records

If you wish to access other records/models in the template, you will
need
`a custom report <reference/reports/custom_reports>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, however in that case you will have to provide the items
above if you need them.

### Translatable Templates

If you wish to translate reports (to the language of a partner, for
example), you need to define two templates:

- The main report template
- The translatable document

You can then call the translatable document from your main template with
the attribute `t-lang` set to a language code (for example `fr` or
`en_US`) or to a record field. You will also need to re-browse the
related records with the proper context if you use fields that are
translatable (like country names, sales conditions, etc.)

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

If your report template does not use translatable record fields,
re-browsing the record in another language is *not* necessary and will
impact performances.
::::

For example, let\'s look at the Sale Order report from the Sale module:

``` xml
<!-- Main template -->
<template id="report_saleorder">
    <t t-call="web.html_container">
        <t t-foreach="docs" t-as="doc">
            <t t-call="sale.report_saleorder_document" t-lang="doc.partner_id.lang"/>
        </t>
    </t>
</template>

<!-- Translatable template -->
<template id="report_saleorder_document">
    <!-- Re-browse of the record with the partner lang -->
    <t t-set="doc" t-value="doc.with_context(lang=doc.partner_id.lang)" />
    <t t-call="web.external_layout">
        <div class="page">
            <div class="oe_structure"/>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-6">
                    <strong t-if="doc.partner_shipping_id == doc.partner_invoice_id">Invoice and shipping address:</strong>
                    <strong t-if="doc.partner_shipping_id != doc.partner_invoice_id">Invoice address:</strong>
                    <div t-field="doc.partner_invoice_id" t-options="{&quot;no_marker&quot;: True}"/>
                <...>
            <div class="oe_structure"/>
        </div>
    </t>
</template>
```

The main template calls the translatable template with
`doc.partner_id.lang` as a `t-lang` parameter, so it will be rendered in
the language of the partner. This way, each Sale Order will be printed
in the language of the corresponding customer. If you wish to translate
only the body of the document, but keep the header and footer in a
default language, you could call the report\'s external layout this way:

``` xml
<t t-call="web.external_layout" t-lang="en_US">
```

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Please take note that this works only when calling external templates,
you will not be able to translate part of a document by setting a
`t-lang` attribute on an xml node other than `t-call`. If you wish to
translate part of a template, you can create an external template with
this partial template and call it from the main one with the `t-lang`
attribute.
::::

### Barcodes

Barcodes are images returned by a controller and can easily be embedded
in reports thanks to the QWeb syntax (e.g. see
`reference/qweb/attributes`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}):

``` html
<img t-att-src="'/report/barcode/QR/%s' % 'My text in qr code'"/>
```

More parameters can be passed as a query string

``` html
<img t-att-src="'/report/barcode/?
    barcode_type=%s&amp;value=%s&amp;width=%s&amp;height=%s'%('QR', 'text', 200, 200)"/>
```

### Useful Remarks

- Twitter Bootstrap and FontAwesome classes can be used in your report
  template

- Local CSS can be put directly in the template

- Global CSS can be inserted in the main report layout by inheriting its
  template and inserting your CSS:

  ``` xml
  <template id="report_saleorder_style" inherit_id="report.style">
    <xpath expr=".">
      <t>
        .example-css-class {
          background-color: red;
        }
      </t>
    </xpath>
  </template>
  ```

- If it appears that your PDF report is missing the styles, please check
  `these instructions <reference/backend/reporting/printed-reports/pdf-without-styles>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

## Paper Format {#reference/reports/paper_formats}

Paper formats are records of `report.paperformat` and can contain the
following attributes:

`name` (mandatory)

:   only useful as a mnemonic/description of the report when looking for
    one in a list of some sort

`description`

:   a small description of your format

`format`

:   either a predefined format (A0 to A9, B0 to B10, Legal, Letter,
    Tabloid,\...) or `custom`; A4 by default. You cannot use a
    non-custom format if you define the page dimensions.

`dpi`

:   output DPI; 90 by default

`margin_top`, `margin_bottom`, `margin_left`, `margin_right`

:   margin sizes in mm

`page_height`, `page_width`

:   page dimensions in mm

`orientation`

:   Landscape or Portrait

`header_line`

:   boolean to display a header line

`header_spacing`

:   header spacing in mm

Example:

``` xml
<record id="paperformat_frenchcheck" model="report.paperformat">
    <field name="name">French Bank Check</field>
    <field name="default" eval="True"/>
    <field name="format">custom</field>
    <field name="page_height">80</field>
    <field name="page_width">175</field>
    <field name="orientation">Portrait</field>
    <field name="margin_top">3</field>
    <field name="margin_bottom">3</field>
    <field name="margin_left">3</field>
    <field name="margin_right">3</field>
    <field name="header_line" eval="False"/>
    <field name="header_spacing">3</field>
    <field name="dpi">80</field>
</record>
```

## Custom Reports {#reference/reports/custom_reports}

By default, the reporting system builds rendering values based on the
target model specified through the `model` field.

However, it will first look for a model named
`report.{module.report_name}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"} and call
that model\'s `_get_report_values(doc_ids, data)` in order to prepare
the rendering data for the template.

This can be used to include arbitrary items to use or display while
rendering the template, such as data from additional models:

``` python
from odoo import api, models

class ParticularReport(models.AbstractModel):
    _name = 'report.module.report_name'

    def _get_report_values(self, docids, data=None):
        # get the report action back as we will need its data
        report = self.env['ir.actions.report']._get_report_from_name('module.report_name')
        # get the records selected for this rendering of the report
        obj = self.env[report.model].browse(docids)
        # return a custom rendering context
        return {
            'lines': docids.get_lines()
        }
```

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

When using a custom report, the \"default\" document-related items
(`doc_ids`, `doc_model` and `docs`) will *not* be included. If you want
them, you will need to include them yourself.

In the example above, the rendering context will contain the \"global\"
values as well as the `lines` we put in there but nothing else.
::::

## Custom fonts {#reference/reports/custom_fonts}

If you want to use custom fonts you will need to add your custom font
and the related less/CSS to the `web.reports_assets_common` assets
bundle. Adding your custom font(s) to `web.assets_common` or
`web.assets_backend` will not make your font available in QWeb reports.

Example:

``` xml
<template id="report_assets_common_custom_fonts" name="Custom QWeb fonts" inherit_id="web.report_assets_common">
    <xpath expr="." position="inside">
        <link href="/your_module/static/src/less/fonts.less" rel="stylesheet" type="text/less"/>
    </xpath>
</template>
```

You will need to define your `@font-face` within this less file, even if
you\'ve used in another assets bundle (other than
`web.reports_assets_common`).

Example:

``` xml
@font-face {
    font-family: 'MonixBold';
    src: local('MonixBold'), local('MonixBold'), url(/your_module/static/fonts/MonixBold-Regular.otf) format('opentype');
}

.h1-title-big {
    font-family: MonixBold;
    font-size: 60px;
    color: #3399cc;
}
```

After you\'ve added the less into your assets bundle you can use the
classes - in this example `h1-title-big` - in your custom QWeb report.

## Reports are web pages

Reports are dynamically generated by the report module and can be
accessed directly via URL:

For example, you can access a Sale Order report in html mode by going to
http://\<server-address\>/report/html/sale.report_saleorder/38

Or you can access the pdf version at
http://\<server-address\>/report/pdf/sale.report_saleorder/38

[^1]: it does not matter what timezone the
    `python:datetime`{.interpreted-text role="class"} object is actually
    in (including no timezone), its timezone will unconditionally be
    *set* to UTC before being adjusted to the user\'s

# Security in Odoo {#reference/security}

Aside from manually managing access using custom code, Odoo provides two
main data-driven mechanisms to manage or restrict access to data.

Both mechanisms are linked to specific users through *groups*: a user
belongs to any number of groups, and security mechanisms are associated
to groups, thus applying security mechanisms to users.

:::::::: res.groups
::: attribute
name

serves as user-readable identification for the group (spells out the
role / purpose of the group)
:::

:::: attribute
category_id

The *module category*, serves to associate groups with an Odoo App (\~a
set of related business models) and convert them into an exclusive
selection in the user form.

::: todo
clarify & document special cases & relationship between groups &
categories better
:::
::::

::: attribute
implied_ids

Other groups to set on the user alongside this one. This is a
convenience pseudo-inheritance relationship: it\'s possible to
explicitly remove implied groups from a user without removing the
implier.
:::

::: attribute
comment

Additional notes on the group e.g.
:::
::::::::

## Access Rights {#reference/security/acl}

*Grants* access to an entire model for a given set of operations. If no
access rights matches an operation on a model for a user (through their
group), the user doesn\'t have access.

Access rights are additive, a user\'s accesses are the union of the
accesses they get through all their groups e.g. given a user who is part
of group A granting read and create access and a group B granting update
access, the user will have all three of create, read, and update.

:::::::::: ir.model.access
::: attribute
name

The purpose or role of the group.
:::

::: attribute
model_id

The model whose access the ACL controls.
:::

::: attribute
group_id

The `res.groups`{.interpreted-text role="class"} to which the accesses
are granted, an empty `group_id`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} means
the ACL is granted to *every user* (non-employees e.g. portal or public
users).
:::

The `perm_{method}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"} attributes grant the
corresponding CRUD access when set, they are all unset by default.

::::::::::

## Record Rules {#reference/security/rules}

Record rules are *conditions* which must be satisfied in order for an
operation to be allowed. Record rules are evaluated record-by-record,
following access rights.

Record rules are default-allow: if access rights grant access and no
rule applies to the operation and model for the user, the access is
granted.

:::::::::::: ir.rule
::: attribute
name

The description of the rule.
:::

::: attribute
model_id

The model to which the rule applies.
:::

::: attribute
groups

The `res.groups`{.interpreted-text role="class"} to which access is
granted (or not). Multiple groups can be specified. If no group is
specified, the rule is *global* which is treated differently than
\"group\" rules (see below).
:::

::: attribute
global

Computed on the basis of `groups`{.interpreted-text role="attr"},
provides easy access to the global status (or not) of the rule.
:::

::: attribute
domain_force

A predicate specified as a
`domain <reference/orm/domains>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, the rule
allows the selected operations if the domain matches the record, and
forbids it otherwise.

The domain is a *python expression* which can use the following
variables:

`time`

:   Python\'s `python:time`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} module.

`user`

:   The current user, as a singleton recordset.

`company_id`

:   The current user\'s currently selected company as a single company
    id (not a recordset).

`company_ids`

:   All the companies to which the current user has access as a list of
    company ids (not a recordset), see
    `howto/company/security`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for more
    details.
:::

The `perm_{method}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"} have completely
different semantics than for `ir.model.access`{.interpreted-text
role="class"}: for rules, they specify which operation the rules applies
*for*. If an operation is not selected, then the rule is not checked for
it, as if the rule did not exist.

All operations are selected by default.

perm_unlink

::::::::::::

### Global rules versus group rules {#reference/security/rules/global}

There is a large difference between global and group rules in how they
compose and combine:

- Global rules *intersect*, if two global rules apply then *both* must
  be satisfied for the access to be granted, this means adding global
  rules always restricts access further.
- Group rules *unify*, if two group rules apply then *either* can be
  satisfied for the access to be granted. This means adding group rules
  can expand access, but not beyond the bounds defined by global rules.
- The global and group rulesets *intersect*, which means the first group
  rule being added to a given global ruleset will restrict access.

:::: danger
::: title
Danger
:::

Creating multiple global rules is risky as it\'s possible to create
non-overlapping rulesets, which will remove all access.
::::

## Field Access {#reference/security/fields}

An ORM `~odoo.fields.Field`{.interpreted-text role="class"} can have a
`groups` attribute providing a list of groups (as a comma-separated
string of `external identifiers`{.interpreted-text role="term"}).

If the current user is not in one of the listed groups, he will not have
access to the field:

- restricted fields are automatically removed from requested views
- restricted fields are removed from
  `~odoo.models.Model.fields_get`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}
  responses
- attempts to (explicitly) read from or write to restricted fields
  results in an access error

::: todo
field access groups apply to the Superuser in fields_get but not in
read/write\...
:::

## Security Pitfalls {#reference/security/pitfalls}

As a developer, it is important to understand the security mechanisms
and avoid common mistakes leading to insecure code.

### Unsafe Public Methods

Any public method can be executed via a `RPC call
<api/external_api/calling_methods>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} with
the chosen parameters. The methods starting with a `_` are not callable
from an action button or external API.

On public methods, the record on which a method is executed and the
parameters can not be trusted, ACL being only verified during CRUD
operations.

``` python
# this method is public and its arguments can not be trusted
def action_done(self):
    if self.state == "draft" and self.env.user.has_group('base.manager'):
        self._set_state("done")

# this method is private and can only be called from other python methods
def _set_state(self, new_state):
    self.sudo().write({"state": new_state})
```

Making a method private is obviously not enough and care must be taken
to use it properly.

### Bypassing the ORM

You should never use the database cursor directly when the ORM can do
the same thing! By doing so you are bypassing all the ORM features,
possibly the automated behaviours like translations, invalidation of
fields, `active`, access rights and so on.

And chances are that you are also making the code harder to read and
probably less secure.

``` python
# very very wrong
self.env.cr.execute('SELECT id FROM auction_lots WHERE auction_id in (' + ','.join(map(str, ids))+') AND state=%s AND obj_price > 0', ('draft',))
auction_lots_ids = [x[0] for x in self.env.cr.fetchall()]

# no injection, but still wrong
self.env.cr.execute('SELECT id FROM auction_lots WHERE auction_id in %s '\
           'AND state=%s AND obj_price > 0', (tuple(ids), 'draft',))
auction_lots_ids = [x[0] for x in self.env.cr.fetchall()]

# nearly there
auction_lots_ids = [x[x] for x in self.env.execute_query(SQL("""
    SELECT id FROM auction_lots
    WHERE auction_id IN %s AND state = %s AND obj_price > 0
""", tuple(ids), 'draft'))

# better
auction_lots_ids = self.search([('auction_id','in',ids), ('state','=','draft'), ('obj_price','>',0)])
```

#### SQL injections

Care must be taken not to introduce SQL injections vulnerabilities when
using manual SQL queries. The vulnerability is present when user input
is either incorrectly filtered or badly quoted, allowing an attacker to
introduce undesirable clauses to a SQL query (such as circumventing
filters or executing `UPDATE` or `DELETE` commands).

The best way to be safe is to never, NEVER use Python string
concatenation (+) or string parameters interpolation (%) to pass
variables to a SQL query string.

The second reason, which is almost as important, is that it is the job
of the database abstraction layer (psycopg2) to decide how to format
query parameters, not your job! For example psycopg2 knows that when you
pass a list of values it needs to format them as a comma-separated list,
enclosed in parentheses !

Even better, there exists a `~odoo.tools.SQL`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} wrapper to build queries using templates that handles the
formatting of inputs. Check
`SQL execution <reference/orm/sql>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for
detailed usage.

``` python
# the following is very bad:
#   - it's a SQL injection vulnerability
#   - it's unreadable
#   - it's not your job to format the list of ids
self.env.cr.execute('SELECT distinct child_id FROM account_account_consol_rel ' +
           'WHERE parent_id IN ('+','.join(map(str, ids))+')')

# better
self.env.cr.execute('SELECT DISTINCT child_id '\
           'FROM account_account_consol_rel '\
           'WHERE parent_id IN %s',
           (tuple(ids),))

# more readable
self.env.cr.execute(SQL("""
    SELECT DISTINCT child_id
    FROM account_account_consol_rel
    WHERE parent_id IN %s
""", tuple(ids)))
```

This is very important, so please be careful also when refactoring, and
most importantly do not copy these patterns!

Here is a memorable example to help you remember what the issue is about
(but do not copy the code there). Before continuing, please be sure to
read the online documentation of pyscopg2 to learn of to use it
properly:

- [The problem with query
  parameters](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage.html#the-problem-with-the-query-parameters)
- [How to pass parameters with
  psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage.html#passing-parameters-to-sql-queries)
- [Advanced parameter
  types](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage.html#adaptation-of-python-values-to-sql-types)
- [Psycopg documentation](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/sql.html)

### Building the domains

Domains are represented as lists and are serializable. You would be
tented to manipulate these lists directly, however it can introduce
subtle issues where the user could inject a domain if the input is not
normalized. Use `~odoo.fields.Domain`{.interpreted-text role="class"} to
handle safely the manipulation of domains.

``` python
# bad
# the user can just pass ['|', ('id', '>', 0)] to access all
domain = ...  # passed by the user
security_domain = [('user_id', '=', self.env.uid)]
domain += security_domain  # can have a side-effect if this is a function argument
self.search(domain)

# better
domain = Domain(...)
domain &= Domain('user_id', '=', self.env.uid)
self.search(domain)
```

### Unescaped field content

When rendering content using JavaScript and XML, one may be tempted to
use a `t-raw` to display rich-text content. This should be avoided as a
frequent [XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting)
vector.

It is very hard to control the integrity of the data from the
computation until the final integration in the browser DOM. A `t-raw`
that is correctly escaped at the time of introduction may no longer be
safe at the next bugfix or refactoring.

``` javascript
QWeb.render('insecure_template', {
    info_message: "You have an <strong>important</strong> notification",
})
```

``` xml
<div t-name="insecure_template">
    <div id="information-bar"><t t-raw="info_message" /></div>
</div>
```

The above code may feel safe as the message content is controlled but is
a bad practice that may lead to unexpected security vulnerabilities once
this code evolves in the future.

``` javascript
// XSS possible with unescaped user provided content !
QWeb.render('insecure_template', {
    info_message: "You have an <strong>important</strong> notification on " \
        + "the product <strong>" + product.name + "</strong>",
})
```

While formatting the template differently would prevent such
vulnerabilities.

``` javascript
QWeb.render('secure_template', {
    message: "You have an important notification on the product:",
    subject: product.name
})
```

``` xml
<div t-name="secure_template">
    <div id="information-bar">
        <div class="info"><t t-esc="message" /></div>
        <div class="subject"><t t-esc="subject" /></div>
    </div>
</div>
```

``` css
.subject {
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

#### Creating safe content using `~markupsafe.Markup`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

See the [official
documentation](https://markupsafe.palletsprojects.com/) for
explanations, but the big advantage of
`~markupsafe.Markup`{.interpreted-text role="class"} is that it\'s a
very rich type overrinding `str`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
operations to *automatically escape parameters*.

This means that it\'s easy to create *safe* html snippets by using
`~markupsafe.Markup`{.interpreted-text role="class"} on a string literal
and \"formatting in\" user-provided (and thus potentially unsafe)
content:

``` pycon
>>> Markup('<em>Hello</em> ') + '<foo>'
Markup('<em>Hello</em> &lt;foo&gt;')
>>> Markup('<em>Hello</em> %s') % '<foo>'
Markup('<em>Hello</em> &lt;foo&gt;')
```

though it is a very good thing, note that the effects can be odd at
times:

``` pycon
>>> Markup('<a>').replace('>', 'x')
Markup('<a>')
>>> Markup('<a>').replace(Markup('>'), 'x')
Markup('<ax')
>>> Markup('<a&gt;').replace('>', 'x')
Markup('<ax')
>>> Markup('<a&gt;').replace('>', '&')
Markup('<a&amp;')
```

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Most of the content-safe APIs actually return a
`~markupsafe.Markup`{.interpreted-text role="class"} with all that
implies.
::::

The `~markupsafe.escape`{.interpreted-text role="class"} method (and its
alias `~odoo.tools.misc.html_escape`{.interpreted-text role="class"})
turns a [str]{.title-ref} into a `~markupsafe.Markup`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} and escapes its content. It will not escape the content of
a `~markupsafe.Markup`{.interpreted-text role="class"} object.

``` python
def get_name(self, to_html=False):
    if to_html:
        return Markup("<strong>%s</strong>") % self.name  # escape the name
    else:
        return self.name

>>> record.name = "<R&D>"
>>> escape(record.get_name())
Markup("&lt;R&amp;D&gt;")
>>> escape(record.get_name(True))
Markup("<strong>&lt;R&amp;D&gt;</strong>")  # HTML is kept
```

When generating HTML code, it is important to separate the structure
(tags) from the content (text).

``` pycon
>>> Markup("<p>") + "Hello <R&D>" + Markup("</p>")
Markup('<p>Hello &lt;R&amp;D&gt;</p>')
>>> Markup("%s <br/> %s") % ("<R&D>", Markup("<p>Hello</p>"))
Markup('&lt;R&amp;D&gt; <br/> <p>Hello</p>')
>>> escape("<R&D>")
Markup('&lt;R&amp;D&gt;')
>>> _("List of Tasks on project %s: %s",
...     project.name,
...     Markup("<ul>%s</ul>") % Markup().join(Markup("<li>%s</li>") % t.name for t in project.task_ids)
... )
Markup('Liste de tâches pour le projet &lt;R&amp;D&gt;: <ul><li>First &lt;R&amp;D&gt; task</li></ul>')

>>> Markup("<p>Foo %</p>" % bar)  # bad, bar is not escaped
>>> Markup("<p>Foo %</p>") % bar  # good, bar is escaped if text and kept if markup

>>> link = Markup("<a>%s</a>") % self.name
>>> message = "Click %s" % link  # bad, message is text and Markup did nothing
>>> message = escape("Click %s") % link  # good, format two markup objects together

>>> Markup(f"<p>Foo {self.bar}</p>")  # bad, bar is inserted before escaping
>>> Markup("<p>Foo {bar}</p>").format(bar=self.bar)  # good, sorry no fstring
```

When working with translations, it is especially important to separate
the HTML from the text. The translation methods accepts a
`~markupsafe.Markup`{.interpreted-text role="class"} parameters and will
escape the translation if it gets receives at least one.

``` pycon
>>> Markup("<p>%s</p>") % _("Hello <R&D>")
Markup('<p>Bonjour &lt;R&amp;D&gt;</p>')
>>> _("Order %s has been confirmed", Markup("<a>%s</a>") % order.name)
Markup('Order <a>SO42</a> has been confirmed')
>>> _("Message received from %(name)s <%(email)s>",
...   name=self.name,
...   email=Markup("<a href='mailto:%s'>%s</a>") % (self.email, self.email)
Markup('Message received from Georges &lt;<a href=mailto:george@abitbol.example>george@abitbol.example</a>&gt;')
```

### Escaping vs Sanitizing

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Escaping is always 100% mandatory when you mix data and code, no matter
how safe the data
::::

**Escaping** converts *TEXT* to *CODE*. It is absolutely mandatory to do
it every time you mix *DATA/TEXT* with *CODE* (e.g. generating HTML or
python code to be evaluated inside a [safe_eval]{.title-ref}), because
*CODE* always requires *TEXT* to be encoded. It is critical for
security, but it\'s also a question of correctness. Even when there is
no security risk (because the text is 100% guarantee to be safe or
trusted), it is still required (e.g. to avoid breaking the layout in
generated HTML).

Escaping will never break any feature, as long as the developer
identifies which variable contains *TEXT* and which contains *CODE*.

``` python
>>> from odoo.tools import html_escape, html_sanitize
>>> data = "<R&D>" # `data` is some TEXT coming from somewhere

# Escaping turns it into CODE, good!
>>> code = html_escape(data)
>>> code
Markup('&lt;R&amp;D&gt;')

# Now you can mix it with other code...
>>> self.website_description = Markup("<strong>%s</strong>") % code
```

**Sanitizing** converts *CODE* to *SAFER CODE* (but not necessary *safe*
code). It does not work on *TEXT*. Sanitizing is only necessary when
*CODE* is untrusted, because it comes in full or in part from some
user-provided data. If the user-provided data is in the form of *TEXT*
(e.g. the content from a form filled by a user), and if that data was
correctly escaped before putting it in *CODE*, then sanitizing is
useless (but can still be done). If however, the user-provided data was
**not escaped**, then sanitizing will **not** work as expected.

``` python
# Sanitizing without escaping is BROKEN: data is corrupted!
>>> html_sanitize(data)
Markup('')

# Sanitizing *after* escaping is OK!
>>> html_sanitize(code)
Markup('<p>&lt;R&amp;D&gt;</p>')
```

Sanitizing can break features, depending on whether the *CODE* is
expected to contain patterns that are not safe. That\'s why
[fields.Html]{.title-ref} and [tools.html_sanitize()]{.title-ref} have
options to fine-tune the level of sanitization for styles, etc. Those
options have to be carefully considered depending on where the data
comes from, and the desired features. The sanitization safety is
balanced against sanitization breakages: the safer the sanitisation the
more likely it is to break things.

``` python
>>> code = "<p class='text-warning'>Important Information</p>"
# this will remove the style, which may break features
# but is necessary if the source is untrusted
>>> html_sanitize(code, strip_classes=True)
Markup('<p>Important Information</p>')
```

### Evaluating content

Some may want to `eval` to parse user provided content. Using `eval`
should be avoided at all cost. A safer, sandboxed, method
`~odoo.tools.safe_eval`{.interpreted-text role="class"} can be used
instead but still gives tremendous capabilities to the user running it
and must be reserved for trusted privileged users only as it breaks the
barrier between code and data.

``` python
# very bad
domain = eval(self.filter_domain)
return self.search(domain)

# better but still not recommended
from odoo.tools import safe_eval
domain = safe_eval(self.filter_domain)
return self.search(domain)

# good
from ast import literal_eval
domain = literal_eval(self.filter_domain)
return self.search(domain)
```

Parsing content does not need `eval`

  Language     Data type            Suitable parser
  ------------ -------------------- ----------------------------------
  Python       int, float, etc.     int(), float()
  Javascript   int, float, etc.     parseInt(), parseFloat()
  Python       dict                 json.loads(), ast.literal_eval()
  Javascript   object, list, etc.   JSON.parse()

### Accessing object attributes

If the values of a record needs to be retrieved or modified dynamically,
one may want to use the `getattr` and `setattr` methods.

``` python
# unsafe retrieval of a field value
def _get_state_value(self, res_id, state_field):
    record = self.sudo().browse(res_id)
    return getattr(record, state_field, False)
```

This code is however not safe as it allows to access any property of the
record, including private attributes or methods.

The `__getitem__` of a recordset has been defined and accessing a
dynamic field value can be easily achieved safely:

``` python
# better retrieval of a field value
def _get_state_value(self, res_id, state_field):
    record = self.sudo().browse(res_id)
    return record[state_field]
```

The above method is obviously still too optimistic and additional
verifications on the record id and field value must be done.

# Testing Odoo {#reference/testing}

There are many ways to test an application. In Odoo, we have three kinds
of tests

- Python unit tests (see [Testing Python code](#testing-python-code)):
  useful for testing model business logic
- JS unit tests (see [Testing JS code](#testing-js-code)): useful to
  test the javascript code in isolation
- Tours (see [Integration Testing](#integration-testing)): tours
  simulate a real situation. They ensures that the python and the
  javascript parts properly talk to each other.

## Testing Python code {#testing/python}

Odoo provides support for testing modules using [Python\'s unittest
library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).

To write tests, simply define a `tests` sub-package in your module, it
will be automatically inspected for test modules. Test modules should
have a name starting with `test_` and should be imported from
`tests/__init__.py`, e.g.

``` text
your_module
├── ...
├── tests
|   ├── __init__.py
|   ├── test_bar.py
|   └── test_foo.py
```

and `__init__.py` contains:

    from . import test_foo, test_bar

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

test modules which are not imported from `tests/__init__.py` will not be
run
::::

The test runner will simply run any test case, as described in the
official [unittest
documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html), but
Odoo provides a number of utilities and helpers related to testing Odoo
content (modules, mainly):

::: {.autoclass members="browse_ref, ref"}
odoo.tests.TransactionCase
:::

::: {.autoclass members="browse_ref, ref"}
odoo.tests.SingleTransactionCase
:::

::: {.autoclass members="browse_ref, ref, url_open, browser_js"}
odoo.tests.HttpCase
:::

::: autofunction
odoo.tests.tagged
:::

By default, tests are run once right after the corresponding module has
been installed. Test cases can also be configured to run after all
modules have been installed, and not run right after the module
installation:

    # coding: utf-8
    from odoo.tests import HttpCase, tagged

    # This test should only be executed after all modules have been installed.
    @tagged('-at_install', 'post_install')
    class WebsiteVisitorTests(HttpCase):
      def test_create_visitor_on_tracked_page(self):
          Page = self.env['website.page']

The most common situation is to use
`~odoo.tests.TransactionCase`{.interpreted-text role="class"} and test a
property of a model in each method:

    class TestModelA(TransactionCase):
        def test_some_action(self):
            record = self.env['model.a'].create({'field': 'value'})
            record.some_action()
            self.assertEqual(
                record.field,
                expected_field_value)

        # other tests...

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Test methods must start with `test_`
::::

::: {.autoclass members=""}
odoo.tests.Form
:::

::: {.autoclass members="add, remove, clear"}
odoo.tests.M2MProxy
:::

::: {.autoclass members="new, edit, remove"}
odoo.tests.O2MProxy
:::

### Running tests

Tests are automatically run when installing or updating modules if
`--test-enable <odoo-bin --test-enable>`{.interpreted-text
role="option"} was enabled when starting the Odoo server.

### Test selection {#developer/reference/testing/selection}

In Odoo, Python tests can be tagged to facilitate the test selection
when running tests.

Subclasses of `odoo.tests.BaseCase`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
(usually through `~odoo.tests.TransactionCase`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} or `~odoo.tests.HttpCase`{.interpreted-text role="class"})
are automatically tagged with `standard` and `at_install` by default.

#### Invocation

`--test-tags <odoo-bin --test-tags>`{.interpreted-text role="option"}
can be used to select/filter tests to run on the command-line. It
implies `--test-enable <odoo-bin --test-enable>`{.interpreted-text
role="option"}, so it\'s not necessary to specify
`--test-enable <odoo-bin --test-enable>`{.interpreted-text
role="option"} when using
`--test-tags <odoo-bin --test-tags>`{.interpreted-text role="option"}.

This option defaults to `+standard` meaning tests tagged `standard`
(explicitly or implicitly) will be run by default when starting Odoo
with `--test-enable <odoo-bin --test-enable>`{.interpreted-text
role="option"}.

When writing tests, the `~odoo.tests.tagged`{.interpreted-text
role="func"} decorator can be used on **test classes** to add or remove
tags.

The decorator\'s arguments are tag names, as strings.

:::: danger
::: title
Danger
:::

`~odoo.tests.tagged`{.interpreted-text role="func"} is a class
decorator, it has no effect on functions or methods
::::

Tags can be prefixed with the minus (`-`) sign, to *remove* them instead
of add or select them e.g. if you don\'t want your test to be executed
by default you can remove the `standard` tag:

``` python
from odoo.tests import TransactionCase, tagged

@tagged('-standard', 'nice')
class NiceTest(TransactionCase):
    ...
```

This test will not be selected by default, to run it the relevant tag
will have to be selected explicitly:

``` console
$ odoo-bin --test-tags nice
```

Note that only the tests tagged `nice` are going to be executed. To run
*both* `nice` and `standard` tests, provide multiple values to
`--test-tags <odoo-bin --test-tags>`{.interpreted-text role="option"}:
on the command-line, values are *additive* (you\'re selecting all tests
with *any* of the specified tags)

``` console
$ odoo-bin --test-tags nice,standard
```

The config switch parameter also accepts the `+` and `-` prefixes. The
`+` prefix is implied and therefore, totally optional. The `-` (minus)
prefix is made to deselect tests tagged with the prefixed tags, even if
they are selected by other specified tags e.g. if there are `standard`
tests which are also tagged as `slow` you can run all standard tests
*except* the slow ones:

``` console
$ odoo-bin --test-tags 'standard,-slow'
```

When you write a test that does not inherit from the
`~odoo.tests.BaseCase`{.interpreted-text role="class"}, this test will
not have the default tags, you have to add them explicitly to have the
test included in the default test suite. This is a common issue when
using a simple `unittest.TestCase` as they\'re not going to get run:

``` python
import unittest
from odoo.tests import tagged

@tagged('standard', 'at_install')
class SmallTest(unittest.TestCase):
    ...
```

Besides tags you can also specify specific modules, classes or functions
to test. The full syntax of the format accepted by
`--test-tags <odoo-bin --test-tags>`{.interpreted-text role="option"}
is:

``` text
[-][tag][/module][:class][.method]
```

So if you want to test the [stock_account]{.title-ref} module, you can
use:

> ``` console
> $ odoo-bin --test-tags /stock_account
> ```

If you want to test a specific function with a unique name, it can be
specified directly:

> ``` console
> $ odoo-bin --test-tags .test_supplier_invoice_forwarded_by_internal_user_without_supplier
> ```

This is equivalent to

> ``` console
> $ odoo-bin --test-tags /account:TestAccountIncomingSupplierInvoice.test_supplier_invoice_forwarded_by_internal_user_without_supplier
> ```

if the name of the test is unambiguous. Multiple modules, classes and
functions can be specified at once separated by a [,]{.title-ref} like
with regular tags.

#### Special tags {#reference/testing/tags}

- `standard`: All Odoo tests that inherit from
  `~odoo.tests.BaseCase`{.interpreted-text role="class"} are implicitly
  tagged standard.
  `--test-tags <odoo-bin --test-tags>`{.interpreted-text role="option"}
  also defaults to `standard`.

  That means untagged test will be executed by default when tests are
  enabled.

- `at_install`: Means that the test will be executed right after the
  module installation and before other modules are installed. This is a
  default implicit tag.

- `post_install`: Means that the test will be executed after all the
  modules are installed. This is what you want for HttpCase tests most
  of the time.

  Note that this is *not exclusive* with `at_install`, however since you
  will generally not want both `post_install` is usually paired with
  `-at_install` when tagging a test class.

#### Examples

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Tests will be executed only in installed modules. If you\'re starting
from a clean database, you\'ll need to install the modules with the
`-i <odoo-bin -i>`{.interpreted-text role="option"} switch at least
once. After that it\'s no longer needed, unless you need to upgrade the
module, in which case `-u <odoo-bin -u>`{.interpreted-text
role="option"} can be used. For simplicity, those switches are not
specified in the examples below.
::::

Run only the tests from the sale module:

``` console
$ odoo-bin --test-tags /sale
```

Run the tests from the sale module but not the ones tagged as slow:

``` console
$ odoo-bin --test-tags '/sale,-slow'
```

Run only the tests from stock or tagged as slow:

``` console
$ odoo-bin --test-tags '-standard, slow, /stock'
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`-standard` is implicit (not required), and present for clarity
::::

## Testing JS code

Testing a complex system is an important safeguard to prevent
regressions and to guarantee that some basic functionality still works.
Since Odoo has a non trivial codebase in Javascript, it is necessary to
test it.

See the `Unit testing <../frontend/unit_testing>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to learn about the various aspect of the front-end testing
framework, or jump directly to one of the sub-sections:

- `Hoot <../frontend/unit_testing/hoot>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
- `Web test helpers <../frontend/unit_testing/web_helpers>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}
- `Mock server <../frontend/unit_testing/mock_server>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}

## Integration Testing {#reference/testing/integration-testing}

Testing Python code and JS code separately is very useful, but it does
not prove that the web client and the server work together. In order to
do that, we can write another kind of test: tours. A tour is a mini
scenario of some interesting business flow. It explains a sequence of
steps that should be followed. The test runner will then create a
PhantomJs browser, point it to the proper url and simulate the click and
inputs, according to the scenario.

### Writing a test tour

#### Structure

To write a test tour for [your_module]{.title-ref}, start with creating
the required files:

``` text
your_module
├── ...
├── static
|   └── tests
|       └── tours
|           └── your_tour.js
├── tests
|   ├── __init__.py
|   └── test_calling_the_tour.py
└── __manifest__.py
```

You can then:

- update `__manifest__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"} to add
  `your_tour.js`{.interpreted-text role="file"} in the assets.

  ``` python
  'assets': {
      'web.assets_tests': [
          'your_module/static/tests/tours/your_tour.js',
      ],
  },
  ```

- update `__init__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"} in the folder
  `tests`{.interpreted-text role="file"} to import
  `test_calling_the_tour`{.interpreted-text role="file"}.

::: seealso
\- `Assets Bundle <reference/assets_bundle>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} - `testing/python`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
:::

#### Javascript {#testing/javascript/test}

1.  Setup your tour by registering it.

    ``` javascript
    import tour from 'web_tour.tour';
    tour.register('rental_product_configurator_tour', {
        url: '/web',  // Here, you can specify any other starting url
    }, [
        // Your sequence of steps
    ]);
    ```

2.  Add any step you want.

Every step contains at least a trigger. You can either use the
[predefined
steps]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web_tour/static/src/tour_service/tour_utils.js#L426)
or write your own personalized step.

Here are some example of steps:

::: example
``` javascript
// First step
tour.stepUtils.showAppsMenuItem(),
// Second step
{
   trigger: '.o_app[data-menu-xmlid="your_module.maybe_your_module_menu_root"]',
   isActive: ['community'],  // Optional
   run: "click",
}, {
    // Third step
},
```
:::

::: example
``` javascript
{
    trigger: '.js_product:has(strong:contains(Chair floor protection)) .js_add',
    run: "click",
},
```
:::

::: example
``` javascript
{
    isActive: ["mobile", "enterprise"],
    content: "Click on Add a product link",
    trigger: 'a:contains("Add a product")',
    tooltipPosition: "bottom",
    async run(helpers) { //Exactly the same as run: "click"
      helpers.click();
    }
},
```
:::

Here are some possible arguments for your personalized steps:

- **trigger**: Required, Selector/element to `run` an action on. The
  tour will wait until the element exists and is visible before
  `run`-ing the action *on it*.

- **run**: Optional, Action to perform on the *trigger* element. If no
  `run`, no action.

  The action can be:

  - A function, asynchronous, executed with the trigger\'s `Tip` as
    context (`this`) and the action helpers as parameter.

  - The name of one of the action helpers, which will be run on the
    trigger element:

    ::: rst-class
    o-definition-list
    :::

    `check`

    :   Ensures that the **trigger** element is checked. This helper is
        intended for [\<input\[type=checkbox\]\>]{.title-ref} elements
        only.

    `clear`

    :   Clears the value of the **trigger** element. This helper is
        intended for [\<input\>]{.title-ref} or
        [\<textarea\>]{.title-ref} elements only.

    `click`

    :   Clicks the **trigger** element, performing all the relevant
        intermediate events.

    `dblclick`,

    :   Same as `click` with two repetitions.

    `drag_and_drop {target}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

    :   Simulates the dragging of the **trigger** element over to the
        `target`.

    `edit {content}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

    :   `clear` the element and then `fill` the `content`.

    `editor {content}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

    :   Focus the **trigger** element (wysiwyg) and then `press` the
        `content`.

    `fill {content}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

    :   Focus the **trigger** element and then `press` the `content`.
        This helper is intended for [\<input\>]{.title-ref} or
        [\<textarea\>]{.title-ref} elements only.

    `hover`

    :   Performs a hover sequence on the **trigger** element.

    `press {content}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

    :   Performs a keyboard event sequence.

    `range {content}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

    :   Focus the **trigger** element and set `content` as value. This
        helper is intended for [\<input\[type=range\]\>]{.title-ref}
        elements only.

    `select {value}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

    :   Performs a selection event sequence on **trigger** element.
        Select the option by its `value`. This helper is intended for
        [\<select\>]{.title-ref} elements only.

    `selectByIndex {index}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

    :   Same as `select` but select the option by its `index`. Note that
        first option has index 0.

    `selectByLabel {label}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

    :   Same as `select` but select the option by its `label`.

    `uncheck`

    :   Ensures that the **trigger** element is unchecked. This helper
        is intended for [\<input\[type=checkbox\]\>]{.title-ref}
        elements only.

- **isActive**: Optional, Activates the step only if all conditions of
  isActive array are met.

  - Browser is in either **desktop** or **mobile** mode.
  - The tour concerns either **community** or **enterprise** edition.
  - The tour is run in either **auto** (runbot) or **manual**
    (onboarding) mode.

- **tooltipPosition**: Optional, `"top"`, `"right"`, `"bottom"`, or
  `"left"`. Where to position the tooltip relative to the **target**
  when running interactive tours.

- **content**: Optional but recommended, the content of the tooltip in
  interactive tours, also logged to the console so very useful to trace
  and debug automated tours.

- **timeout**: How long to wait until the step can `run`, in
  milliseconds, 10000 (10 seconds).

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The last step(s) of a tour should always return the client to a
\"stable\" state (e.g. no ongoing editions) and ensure all side-effects
(network requests) have finished running to avoid race conditions or
errors during teardown.

:::

#### Python

To start a tour from a python test, make the class inherit from
`~odoo.tests.HTTPCase`{.interpreted-text role="class"}, and call
\`start_tour\`:

``` python
def test_your_test(self):
    # Optional Setup
    self.start_tour("/web", "your_tour_name", login="admin")
    # Optional verifications
```

### Writing an onboarding tour

#### Structure

To write an onboarding tour for [your_module]{.title-ref}, start with
creating the required files:

``` text
your_module
├── ...
├── data
|   └── your_tour.xml
├── static/src/js/tours/your_tour.js
└── __manifest__.py
```

You can then update `__manifest__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"} to
add `your_tour.js`{.interpreted-text role="file"} in the assets and
`your_tour.xml`{.interpreted-text role="file"} in the data.

> ``` python
> 'data': [
>    'data/your_tour.xml',
> ],
> 'assets': {
>     'web.assets_backend': [
>         'your_module/static/src/js/tours/your_tour.js',
>     ],
> },
> ```

#### Javascript

The javascript part is the same as for :ref: [the test tour
\<testing/javascript/test\>]{.title-ref}.

#### XML

When you have your tour in the javascript registry, you can create a
record [web_tour.tour]{.title-ref} in the xml, like that:

> ``` xml
> <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
> <odoo>
>     <record id="your_tour" model="web_tour.tour">
>         <field name="name">your_tour</field>
>         <field name="sequence">10</field>
>         <field name="rainbow_man_message">Congrats, that was a great tour</field>
>     </record>
> </odoo>
> ```

- \`name\`: Required, the name must be the same as the one in the
  javascript registry.
- \`sequence\`: Optional; determines the order to execute the onboarding
  tours. Defaults to 1000.
- \`url\`: Optional; the url where to start the tour. If `url` is
  `False`, take the url from the registry. Defaults to \"/odoo\".
- \`rainbow_man_message\`: Optional; will show the message in the
  rainbow man effect at the completion of the tour. If
  `rainbow_man_message` is `False`, there is no rainbow effect. Defaults
  to `<b>Good job!</b> You went through all steps of this tour.`

#### Running onboarding tours

They can all be started in their sequence order by toggling the
`Onboarding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option in the user menu.
You can run specific onboarding tours by going to the
`Settings --> Technical --> User Interface --> Tours`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and clicking on `Onboarding`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Testing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- **Onboarding**: will execute the tour in interactive mode. That means
  the tour will show what to do and wait for interactions from the user.
- **Testing**: will execute the tour automatically. That means the tour
  will be executing all the step in front of the user.

#### Tour recorder

You can also create tours easily with the tour recorder. To do so, click
on `Record`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the onboarding tours
view. When started, this tool will record all your interactions in Odoo.

The created tours are flagged in the onboarding tours view as
**Custom**. These tours can also be exported to a javascript file, ready
to be put in your module.

### Debugging tips

#### Observing test tours in a browser

There are three ways with different tradeoffs:

##### `watch=True`

When running a tour locally via the test suite, the `watch=True`
parameter can be added to the `browser_js` or `start_tour` call:

    self.start_tour("/web", "your_tour_name", watch=True)

This will automatically open a Chrome window with the tour being run
inside it.

**Advantages**

:   - always works if the tour has Python setup / surrounding code, or
      multiple steps
    - runs entirely automatically (just select the test which launches
      the tour)
    - transactional (*should* always be runnable multiple times)

**Drawbacks**

:   - only works locally
    - only works if the test / tour can run correctly locally

##### `debug=True`

When running a tour locally via the test suite, the `debug=True`
parameter can be added to the `browser_js` or `start_tour` call:

    self.start_tour("/web", "your_tour_name", debug=True)

This will automatically open a fullscreen Chrome window with opened
devtools and a debugger breakpoint set at the start of the tour. The
tour is ran with the debug=assets query parameter. When an error is
thrown, the debugger stops on the exception.

**Advantages**

:   - Same advantages as mode [watch=True]{.title-ref}
    - Easier to debug steps

**Drawbacks**

:   - only works locally
    - only works if the test / tour can run correctly locally

##### Run via browser

Test tours can also be launched via the browser UI by calling

``` javascript
odoo.startTour("tour_name");
```

in the javascript console, or by enabling `tests mode
<frontend/framework/tests_debug_mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} by
setting `?debug=tests` in the URL.

**Advantages**

:   - easier to run
    - can be used on production or test sites, not just local instances
    - allows running in \"Onboarding\" mode (manual steps)

**Drawbacks**

:   - harder to use with test tours involving Python setup
    - may not work multiple times depending on tour side-effects

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

It\'s possible to use this method to observe or interact with tours
which require Python setup:

- add a *python* breakpoint before the relevant tour is started
  (`start_tour` or `browser_js` call)
- when the breakpoint is hit, open the instance in your browser
- run the tour

At this point the Python setup will be visible to the browser, and the
tour will be able to run.

You may want to comment the `start_tour` or `browser_js` call if you
also want the test to continue afterwards, depending on the tour\'s
side-effects.
::::

#### Screenshots and screencasts during browser_js tests

When running tests that use `HttpCase.browser_js` from the command line,
the Chrome browser is used in headless mode. By default, if a test
fails, a PNG screenshot is taken at the moment of the failure and
written in

``` console
'/tmp/odoo_tests/{db_name}/screenshots/'
```

Two new command line arguments were added since Odoo 13.0 to control
this behavior:
`--screenshots <odoo-bin --screenshots>`{.interpreted-text
role="option"} and
`--screencasts <odoo-bin --screencasts>`{.interpreted-text
role="option"}

#### Introspecting / debugging steps

When trying to fix / debug a tour, the screenshots (on failure) are not
necessarily sufficient. In that case it can be useful to see what\'s
happening at some or each step.

While this is pretty easy when in an \"onboarding\" (as they\'re mostly
driven explicitly by the user) it\'s more complicated when running
\"test\" tours, or when running tours through the test suite. In that
case there are two main tricks:

- A step property `break: true,` in debug mode (debug=True).

  This adds a debugger breakpoint at the start of the step. You can then
  add your own wherever you need.

  **Advantages**

  :   - very simple
      - the tour continues as soon as you resume execution

  **Drawbacks**

  :   - page interaction is limited as all javascript is blocked

- A step property `pause: true,` in debug mode (debug=True).

  The tour will stop at the end of the step. This allows inspecting and
  interacting with the page until the developer is ready to resume by
  typing **play();** in the browser console.

  **Advantages**

  :   - allows interacting with the page
      - no useless (for this situation) debugger UI

- A step with a `run() { debugger; }` action.

  This can be added to an existing step, or can be a new dedicated step.
  Once the step\'s **trigger** is matched, the execution will stop all
  javascript execution.

  **Advantages**

  :   - simple
      - the tour continues as soon as you resume execution

  **Drawbacks**

  :   - page interaction is limited as all javascript is blocked
      - the debugger is triggered after trying to find targeted element
        defined in the step.

## Performance Testing

### Query counts

One of the ways to test performance is to measure database queries.
Manually, this can be tested with the [\--log-sql]{.title-ref} CLI
parameter. If you want to establish the maximum number of queries for an
operation, you can use the
`~odoo.tests.BaseCase.assertQueryCount`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}
method, integrated in Odoo test classes.

``` python
with self.assertQueryCount(11):
    do_something()
```

# Command-line interface (CLI) {#reference/cmdline}

The CLI `command-line interface`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"} offers
several functionalities related to Odoo. You can use it to
`run the server <reference/cmdline/server>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `launch Odoo as a Python console
environment <reference/cmdline/shell>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`scaffold an Odoo module <reference/cmdline/scaffold>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`populate a database <reference/cmdline/populate>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or
`count the number of lines of code <reference/cmdline/cloc>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

:::::::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The command to use to call the CLI depends on how you installed Odoo. In
the examples below, we assume that you are
`running Odoo from source </administration/on_premise/source>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} with the `odoo-bin`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file. If
you installed Odoo `from a distribution package
</administration/on_premise/packages>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} or
with [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/odoo/), you must adapt the
command.

:::::: tabs
::: tab
Run Odoo from source

1.  Navigate to the root of the directory where you downloaded the
    source files of Odoo Community.
2.  Run all CLI commands with `./odoo-bin`{.interpreted-text
    role="command"}
:::

::: tab
Odoo was installed from a distribution package

When Odoo was installed, an executable named [odoo]{.title-ref} was
added to your user\'s PATH. Replace all occurrences of
`odoo-bin`{.interpreted-text role="command"} with
`odoo`{.interpreted-text role="command"} in the examples below.

:::

This command shows all the available commands for Odoo.

It has no options.

## [server]{.title-ref} - Run the Server {#reference/cmdline/server}

::: program
odoo-bin
:::

This command is the default one: you can omit it, and it will be chosen
anyway.

::: option

`-d <database>, --database <database>`

:   

database(s) used when installing or updating modules. Providing a
comma-separated list restrict access to databases provided in list.

For advanced database options, take a look
`below <reference/cmdline/server/database>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
:::

::: option

`-i <modules>, --init <modules>`

:   

comma-separated list of modules to install before running the server
(requires `-d`{.interpreted-text role="option"}).
:::

::: option

`-u <modules>, --update <modules>`

:   

comma-separated list of modules to update before running the server. Use
`all` for all modules. (requires `-d`{.interpreted-text role="option"}).
:::

::: option

`--reinit <modules>`

:   

A comma-separated list of modules to reinitialize before starting the
server. (requires `-d`{.interpreted-text role="option"}).

The reinitialization is similar to a simple upgrade without executing
any upgrade script. It loads data in `init` mode instead of `update`
mode, primarily affecting records marked as `'noupdate'`. All modules
that depend directly or indirectly on the specified ones will also be
reinitialized.

This option is intended for debugging or development purposes only. **Do
not use it with a production database.**
:::

::: option

`--addons-path <directories>`

:   

comma-separated list of directories in which modules are stored. These
directories are scanned for modules.
:::

::: option

`--upgrade-path <upgrade_path>`

:   

comma-separated list of directories from which additional upgrade
scripts are loaded.
:::

::: option

`--pre-upgrade-scripts <pre_upgrade_scripts>`

:   

comma-separated list of paths to upgrade scripts. The scripts are run
before loading base module when an upgrade of any module is requested.
This is useful to perform some actions during custom modules upgrade
after a major upgrade.
:::

::: option

`--load <modules>`

:   

list of server-wide modules to load. Those modules are supposed to
provide features not necessarily tied to a particular database. This is
in contrast to modules that are always bound to a specific database when
they are installed (i.e. the majority of Odoo addons). Default is
`base,web`.
:::

::: option

`-c <config>, --config <config>`

:   

path to an alternate
`configuration file <reference/cmdline/config>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. If not defined, Odoo checks `ODOO_RC` environmental
variable and default location `{$HOME}/.odoorc`{.interpreted-text
role="file"}. See configuration file section
`below <reference/cmdline/config>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
:::

::: option

`-D <data-dir-path>, --data-dir <data-dir-path>`

:   

directory path where to store Odoo data (eg. filestore, sessions). If
not specified, Odoo will fallback to a predefined path. On Unix systems
its one defined in `$XDG_DATA_HOME` environmental variable or
`~/.local/share/Odoo`{.interpreted-text role="file"} or
`/var/lib/Odoo`{.interpreted-text role="file"}.
:::

::: option

`-s, --save`

:   

saves the server configuration to the current configuration file
(`{$HOME}/.odoorc`{.interpreted-text role="file"} by default, and can be
overridden using `-c`{.interpreted-text role="option"}).
:::

::: option

`--with-demo`

:   

install demo data in new databases.
:::

::: option

`--without-demo`

:   

don\'t install demo data nor in new databases nor when installing new
modules in a database that uses demo data, this is the default.
:::

::: option

`--skip-auto-install`

:   

skips auto-installing modules when a new module installation is
requested. This option is useful for development. It serves to check if
the installed modules do not indirectly depend on auto-installed
modules.
:::

::: option

`--pidfile=<pidfile>`

:   

path to a file where the server pid will be stored
:::

::: option

`--stop-after-init`

:   

stops the server after its initialization.
:::

::: option

`--geoip-city-db <path>`

:   

Absolute path to the GeoIP City database file.
:::

::: option

`--geoip-country-db <path>`

:   

Absolute path to the GeoIP Country database file.
:::

### Testing {#reference/cmdline/testing}

::: option

`--test-enable`

:   

runs tests after module installation
:::

::: option

`--test-file <file>`

:   

runs a python test file
:::

::: option
\--test-tags \[-\]\[tag\]\[/module\]\[:class\]\[.method\]

Comma-separated list of specs to filter which tests to execute. Enable
unit tests if set.

Example: [\--test-tags
:TestClass.test_func,/test_module,external]{.title-ref}

- The [-]{.title-ref} specifies if we want to include or exclude tests
  matching this spec.
- The tag will match tags added on a class with a
  `~odoo.tests.common.tagged`{.interpreted-text role="func"} decorator
  (all `test classes <reference/testing>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  have [standard]{.title-ref} and [at_install]{.title-ref} tags until
  explicitly removed, see the decorator documentation).
- [\*]{.title-ref} will match all tags.
- If tag is omitted on include mode, its value is
  [standard]{.title-ref}.
- If tag is omitted on exclude mode, its value is [\*]{.title-ref}.
- The module, class, and method will respectively match the module name,
  test class name and test method name.

Filtering and executing the tests happens twice: right after each module
installation/update and at the end of the modules loading. At each stage
tests are filtered by [\--test-tags]{.title-ref} specs and additionally
by dynamic specs [at_install]{.title-ref} and [post_install]{.title-ref}
correspondingly.
:::

::: option

`--screenshots`

:   

Specify directory where to write screenshots when an HttpCase.browser_js
test fails. It defaults to
`/tmp/odoo_tests/{db_name}/screenshots`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
:::

::: option

`--screencasts`

:   

Enable screencasts and specify directory where to write screencasts
files. The `ffmpeg` utility needs to be installed to encode frames into
a video file. Otherwise frames will be kept instead of the video file.
:::

### Database {#reference/cmdline/server/database}

::: option

`-r <user>, --db_user <user>`

:   

database username, used to connect to PostgreSQL.
:::

::: option

`-w <password>, --db_password <password>`

:   

database password, if using [password
authentication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/auth-methods.html#AUTH-PASSWORD).
:::

::: option

`--db_host <hostname>`

:   

host for the database server

- `localhost` on Windows
- UNIX socket otherwise
:::

::: option

`--db_port <port>`

:   

port the database listens on, defaults to 5432
:::

::: option

`--db_replica_host <hostname>`

:   

host for the replica database server, disabled when not set / empty
:::

::: option

`--db_replica_port <port>`

:   

the port the replica database listens on, defaults to
`--db_port`{.interpreted-text role="option"}
:::

::::: option

`--db-filter <filter>`

:   

hides databases that do not match `<filter>` for the Web UI. The filter
is a [regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html),
with the additions that:

- `%h` is replaced by the whole hostname the request is made on.

- `%d` is replaced by the subdomain the request is made on, with the
  exception of `www` (so domain `odoo.com` and `www.odoo.com` both match
  the database `odoo`).

  These operations are case sensitive. Add option `(?i)` to match all
  databases (so domain `odoo.com` using `(?i)%d` matches the database
  `Odoo`).

Since version 11, it\'s also possible to restrict access to a given
database listen by using the \--database parameter and specifying a
comma-separated list of databases

When combining the two parameters, db-filter supersedes the
comma-separated database list for restricting database list, while the
comma-separated list is used for performing requested operations like
upgrade of modules.

``` bash
$ odoo-bin --db-filter ^11.*$
```

Restrict access to databases whose name starts with 11

``` bash
$ odoo-bin --database 11firstdatabase,11seconddatabase
```

Restrict access to only two databases, 11firstdatabase and
11seconddatabase

``` bash
$ odoo-bin --database 11firstdatabase,11seconddatabase -u base
```

Restrict access to only two databases, 11firstdatabase and
11seconddatabase, and update base module on one database:
11firstdatabase. If database 11seconddatabase doesn\'t exist, the
database is created and base modules is installed

``` bash
$ odoo-bin --db-filter ^11.*$ --database 11firstdatabase,11seconddatabase -u base
```

Restrict access to databases whose name starts with 11, and update base
module on one database: 11firstdatabase. If database 11seconddatabase
doesn\'t exist, the database is created and base modules is installed

::: option

`--unaccent`

:   

Try to enable the unaccent extension when creating new databases
:::

### Emails {#reference/cmdline/server/emails}

::: option

`--email-from <address>`

:   

Email address used as \<FROM\> when Odoo needs to send mails
:::

::: option

`--from-filter <address or domain>`

:   

Define which email address the SMTP configuration will apply to. The
field can be a domain name or an entire email address, or it can remain
empty. If the sender\'s email address does not match this set filter,
then the email will be encapsulated using a combination of the two
system parameters: `mail.default.from` and `mail.catchall.domain`. For
example, \"Admin\" \<admin@example.com\> =\> \"Admin\"
\<notifications@mycompany.com\>.
:::

::: option

`--smtp <server>`

:   

Address of the SMTP server to connect to in order to send mails
:::

::: option

`--smtp-port <port>`

:   
:::

::: option

`--smtp-ssl`

:   

If set, odoo should use SSL/STARTSSL SMTP connections
:::

::: option

`--smtp-user <name>`

:   

Username to connect to the SMTP server
:::

:::

::: option

`--smtp-ssl-certificate-filename <path/to/cert.pem>`

:   

An SSL certificate is to be used for authentication. If set, then
[smtp-ssl-private-key]{.title-ref} is required.
:::

::: option

`--smtp-ssl-private-key-filename <path/to/key.pem>`

:   

An SSL private key is used for authentication. If set, then
[smtp-ssl-certificate]{.title-ref} is required.
:::

### Internationalisation {#reference/cmdline/server/internationalisation}

::: option

`--load-language <languages>`

:   

specifies the languages (separated by commas) for the translations you
want to be loaded
:::

::: option

`--i18n-overwrite`

:   

overwrites existing translation terms on updating a module or importing
a CSV or a PO file.
:::

### Advanced Options {#reference/cmdline/advanced}

#### Developer features {#reference/cmdline/dev}

::: option

`--dev <feature,feature,...,feature>`

:   

comma-separated list of features. For development purposes only. Do not
use it in production. Possible features are:

- `all`: alias for xml,reload,qweb,access
- `xml`: read QWeb template from xml file directly instead of database.
  Once a template has been modified in database, it will be not be read
  from the xml file until the next update/init. Particularly, templates
  are not translated on using this option.
- `reload`: restart server when python file are updated (may not be
  detected depending on the text editor used)
- `qweb`: break in the evaluation of QWeb template when a node contains
  `t-debug='debugger'`
- `werkzeug`: display the full traceback on the frontend page in case of
  exception
- `replica`: simulate `--db_replica_host`{.interpreted-text
  role="option"} but connect to the same datbase server as
  `--db_host`{.interpreted-text role="option"}, this makes it possible
  to test read-only features without the need to set up a replicated
  database.
- `access`: log the traceback next to the AccessError when it results in
  a 403 - Forbidden HTTP response.
:::

#### HTTP {#reference/cmdline/server/http}

TCP port for websocket connections in multiprocessing or gevent mode,
defaults to 8072. Not used in default (threaded) mode.
:::

::::: option

`--proxy-mode`

:   

enables the use of `X-Forwarded-*` headers through [Werkzeug\'s proxy
support](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/0.16.x/middleware/proxy_fix/#module-werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix).

It ignores all `X-Forwarded-*` headers in case `X-Forwarded-Host` is
missing from the request.

It always gets the real IP from the last entry of the `X-Forwarded-For`
chain. Configure your web server accordingly using directives such as
nginx\'s
[set_real_ip_from](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_realip_module.html)
in case there are other trusted proxies along the chain that must be
ignored.

`X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` are used to update the
request root URL, which in turn is used to update the `web.base.url`
system parameter upon a successful admin authentication. This system
parameter is used to generate all links for the current database; see
`domain-name/web-base-url`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

proxy mode *must not* be enabled outside of a reverse proxy scenario
::::
:::::

::: option

`--x-sendfile`

:   

delegates serving attachments files to the static web server and sets
both `X-Sendfile` (apache) and `X-Accel-*` (nginx) http headers on
stream responses. See `deploy/streaming`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
for web server configuration.
:::

#### Logging {#reference/cmdline/server/logging}

By default, Odoo displays all logging of
[level](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.setLevel)
`INFO`, `WARNING` and `ERROR`. All logs independently of the level are
output on `stderr`. Various options are available to redirect logging to
other destinations and to customize the verbosity.

::: option

`--logfile <file>`

:   

sends logging output to the specified file instead of `stderr`. On Unix,
the file [can be managed by external log rotation
programs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#watchedfilehandler)
and will automatically be reopened when replaced
:::

::: option

`--syslog`

:   

logs to the system\'s event logger: [syslog on
unices](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#sysloghandler)
and [the Event Log on
Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#nteventloghandler).

Neither is configurable
:::

::: option

`--log-db <dbname>`

:   

logs to the `ir.logging` model (`ir_logging` table) of the specified
database. The database can be the name of a database in the \"current\"
PostgreSQL, or [a PostgreSQL
URI](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/libpq-connect.html#AEN38208)
for e.g. log aggregation.
:::

::: option

`--log-handler <handler-spec>`

:   

`{LOGGER}:{LEVEL}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}, enables `LOGGER` at
the provided `LEVEL` e.g. `odoo.models:DEBUG` will enable all logging
messages at or above `DEBUG` level in the models.

- The colon `:` is mandatory
- The logger can be omitted to configure the root (default) handler
- If the level is omitted, the logger is set to `INFO`

The option can be repeated to configure multiple loggers e.g.

``` console
$ odoo-bin --log-handler :DEBUG --log-handler werkzeug:CRITICAL --log-handler odoo.fields:WARNING
```
:::

::: option

`--log-web`

:   

enables DEBUG logging of HTTP requests and responses, equivalent to
`--log-handler=odoo.http:DEBUG`
:::

::: option

`--log-sql`

:   

enables DEBUG logging of SQL querying, equivalent to
`--log-handler=odoo.sql_db:DEBUG`
:::

::::: option

`--log-level <level>`

:   

Shortcut to more easily set predefined levels on specific loggers.
\"real\" levels (`critical`, `error`, `warn`, `debug`) are set on the
`odoo` and `werkzeug` loggers (except for `debug` which is only set on
`odoo`).

Odoo also provides debugging pseudo-levels which apply to different sets
of loggers:

`debug_sql`

:   sets the SQL logger to `debug`

    equivalent to `--log-sql`

`debug_rpc`

:   sets the `odoo` and HTTP request loggers to `debug`

    equivalent to `--log-level debug --log-request`

`debug_rpc_answer`

:   sets the `odoo` and HTTP request and response loggers to `debug`

    equivalent to `--log-level debug --log-request --log-response`

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In case of conflict between `--log-level`{.interpreted-text
role="option"} and `--log-handler`{.interpreted-text role="option"}, the
latter is used
::::
:::::

#### Multiprocessing {#reference/cdmline/workers}

:::::::::: option

`--workers <count>`

:   

if `count` is not 0 (the default), enables multiprocessing and sets up
the specified number of HTTP workers (sub-processes processing HTTP and
RPC requests).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

multiprocessing mode is only available on Unix-based systems
::::

A number of options allow limiting and recycling workers:

::: option

`--limit-request <limit>`

:   

Number of requests a worker will process before being recycled and
restarted.

Defaults to *8196*.
:::

::: option

`--limit-memory-soft <limit>`

:   

Maximum allowed virtual memory per worker in bytes. If the limit is
exceeded, the worker is killed and recycled at the end of the current
request.

Defaults to *2048MiB (2048\*1024\*1024B)*.
:::

::: option

`--limit-memory-hard <limit>`

:   

Hard limit on virtual memory in bytes, any worker exceeding the limit
will be immediately killed without waiting for the end of the current
request processing.

Defaults to *2560MiB (2560\*1024\*1024B)*.
:::

::: option

`--limit-time-cpu <limit>`

:   

Prevents the worker from using more than \<limit\> CPU seconds for each
request. If the limit is exceeded, the worker is killed.

Defaults to *60*.
:::

::: option

`--limit-time-real <limit>`

:   

Prevents the worker from taking longer than \<limit\> seconds to process
a request. If the limit is exceeded, the worker is killed.

Differs from `--limit-time-cpu`{.interpreted-text role="option"} in that
this is a \"wall time\" limit including e.g. SQL queries.

Defaults to *120*.
:::
::::::::::

::: option

`--max-cron-threads <count>`

:   

number of workers dedicated to
`cron <reference/actions/cron>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} jobs.
Defaults to *2*. The workers are threads in multi-threading mode and
processes in multi-processing mode.

For multi-processing mode, this is in addition to the HTTP worker
processes.
:::

::: option

`--limit-time-worker-cron <limit>`

:   

Soft limit on how long a
`cron <reference/actions/cron>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
thread/worker is allowed to live before is is restarted, in seconds.

Set to 0 to disable.

Defaults to *0*.
:::

## Configuration file {#reference/cmdline/config}

::: program
odoo-bin
:::

Most of the command-line options can also be specified via a
configuration file. Most of the time, they use similar names with the
prefix `-` removed and other `-` are replaced by `_` e.g.
`--db-template`{.interpreted-text role="option"} becomes `db_template`.

Some conversions don\'t match the pattern:

- `--db-filter`{.interpreted-text role="option"} becomes `dbfilter`
- `--no-http`{.interpreted-text role="option"} corresponds to the
  `http_enable` boolean
- logging presets (all options starting with `--log-` except for
  `--log-handler`{.interpreted-text role="option"} and
  `--log-db`{.interpreted-text role="option"}) just add content to
  `log_handler`, use that directly in the configuration file
- `--smtp`{.interpreted-text role="option"} is stored as `smtp_server`
- `--database`{.interpreted-text role="option"} is stored as `db_name`

::: {#reference/cmdline/config_file}
The default configuration file is `{$HOME}/.odoorc`{.interpreted-text
role="file"} which can be overridden using
`--config <odoo-bin -c>`{.interpreted-text role="option"}. Specifying
`--save <odoo-bin -s>`{.interpreted-text role="option"} will save the
current configuration state back to that file. The configuration items
relative to the command-line are to be specified in the section
`[options]`.
:::

Here is a sample file:

``` ini
[options]
db_user=odoo
dbfilter=odoo
```

## [shell]{.title-ref} - Open a Shell {#reference/cmdline/shell}

The Odoo command line also allows launching Odoo as a Python console
environment, enabling direct interaction with the
`orm <reference/orm>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and its
functionalities. Since running a shell involves starting the server, the
configuration file options do apply.

``` console
$ odoo-bin shell
```

## [populate]{.title-ref} - Populate a Database {#reference/cmdline/populate}

::: program
odoo-bin populate
:::

Odoo Populate allows to duplicate existing data in a given database.
This can be used for testing and benchmarking when large tables are
needed. The duplication process introduces variation for some fields to
respect [UNIQUE]{.title-ref} constraints, among other things. It also
follows x2Many relationships.

``` console
$ odoo-bin populate -d  my_database --models res.partner,account.move --factors 1000
```

::: option

## [cloc]{.title-ref} - Count Lines of Code {#reference/cmdline/cloc}

::: program
odoo-bin cloc
:::

Odoo Cloc is a tool to count the number of relevant lines of code
written in Python, Javascript, CSS, SCSS, or XML. This can be used as a
rough metric for pricing maintenance of extra modules.

``` console
$ odoo-bin cloc -c config.conf -d my_database
```

::: option

`-d <database>, --database <database>`

:   
:::

| Process the code of all extra modules installed on the provided
  database, and of all server actions and computed fields manually
  created in the provided database.
| The `--addons-path`{.interpreted-text role="option"} option is
  required to specify the path(s) to the module folder(s).
| If combined with `--path`{.interpreted-text role="option"}, the count
  will be that of the sum of both options\' results (with possible
  overlaps). At least one of these two options is required to specify
  which code to process.

``` console
$ odoo-bin cloc --addons-path=addons -d my_database
```

::: seealso
\- `reference/cmdline/cloc/database-option`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
:::

::: option

`-p <path>, --path <path>`

:   
:::

| Process the files in the provided path.
| If combined with `--database`{.interpreted-text role="option"}, the
  count will be that of the sum of both options\' results (with possible
  overlaps). At least one of these two options is required to specify
  which code to process.

``` console
$ odoo-bin cloc -p addons/account
```

Multiple paths can be provided by repeating the option.

``` console
$ odoo-bin cloc -p addons/account -p addons/sale
```

::: seealso
\- `reference/cmdline/cloc/path-option`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
:::

::: option

`--addons-path <directories>`

:   
:::

| Comma-separated list of directories in which modules are stored. These
  directories are scanned for modules.
| Required if the `--database`{.interpreted-text role="option"} option
  is used.

::: option

`-c <directories>`

:   
:::

Specify a configuration file to use in place of the
`--addons-path`{.interpreted-text role="option"} option.

::: option

`-v, --verbose`

:   
:::

Show the details of lines counted for each file.

### Processed files

#### With the `--database`{.interpreted-text role="option"} option {#reference/cmdline/cloc/database-option}

Odoo Cloc counts the lines in each file of extra installed modules in a
given database. In addition, it counts the Python lines of server
actions and custom computed fields that have been directly created in
the database or imported. Finally, it counts the lines of code of
Javascript, CSS, and SCSS files, and of QWeb views from imported
modules.

Some files are excluded from the count by default:

- The manifest (`__manifest__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"} or
  `__openerp__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"})
- The contents of the folder `static/lib`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
- The tests defined in the folder `tests`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
  and `static/tests`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
- The migrations scripts defined in the folder
  `migrations`{.interpreted-text role="file"} and [upgrades]{.title-ref}
- The XML files declared in the `demo` or `demo_xml` sections of the
  manifest

For special cases, a list of files that should be ignored by Odoo Cloc
can be defined per module. This is specified by the `cloc_exclude` entry
of the manifest:

``` python
"cloc_exclude": [
    "lib/common.py", # exclude a single file
    "data/*.xml",    # exclude all XML files in a specific folder
    "example/**/*",  # exclude all files in a folder hierarchy recursively
    "**/*.scss",     # exclude all scss file from the module
]
```

| The pattern `**/*` can be used to ignore an entire module. This can be
  useful to exclude a module from maintenance service costs.
| For more information about the pattern syntax, see
  [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob).

#### With the `--path`{.interpreted-text role="option"} option {#reference/cmdline/cloc/path-option}

This method works the same as with the `--database option
<reference/cmdline/cloc/database-option>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
if a manifest file is present in the given folder. Otherwise, it counts
all files.

### Identifying Extra Modules

To distinguish between standard and extra modules, Odoo Cloc uses the
following heuristic: modules that are located (real file system path,
after following symbolic links) in the same parent directory as the
`base`, `web` or `web_enterprise` standard modules are considered
standard. Other modules are treated as extra modules.

### Error Handling

Some file cannot be counted by Odoo Cloc. Those file are reported at the
end of the output.

#### Max file size exceeded

Odoo Cloc rejects any file larger than 25MB. Usually, source files are
smaller than 1 MB. If a file is rejected, it may be:

- A generated XML file that contains lots of data. It should be excluded
  in the manifest.
- A JavaScript library that should be placed in the
  `static/lib`{.interpreted-text role="file"} folder.

#### Syntax Error

Odoo Cloc cannot count the lines of code of a Python file with a syntax
problem. If an extra module contains such files, they should be fixed to
allow the module to load. If the module works despite the presence of
those files, they are probably not loaded and should therefore be
removed from the module, or at least excluded in the manifest via
`cloc_exclude`.

## [obfuscate]{.title-ref} - Obfuscate database {#reference/cmdline/obfuscate}

::: program
odoo-bin obfuscate
:::

This command provides a quick and easy way to obfuscate some of the data
in the Odoo instance, mainly used for instructional purposes or to make
quick videos for the support team helping technicians avoid leaking
sensitive information.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

This command must be used carefully, as it is **not** considered a safe
method for full anonymizing data before transfer to a third party.
Images, PDF attachments, amounts, many other informations may not be
obfuscated and cause sensitive information leaks. A thorough review is
required before sharing data to ensure that no sensitive information is
exposed.
::::

Obfuscation is symmetric, so content can be unobfuscated using the same
password.

All the configurations available for the
`server <reference/cmdline/server>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
command are available here too.

``` console
$ odoo-bin obfuscate --pwd=<password>
```

::: option

`--pwd <password>`

:   

(Required) the password that will be used to symmetrically obfuscate
content.
:::

::: option

`--unobfuscate`

:   

if you want to unobfuscate instead of obfuscate.
:::

::: option

`--fields <fields>`

:   

comma-separated list of [table.column]{.title-ref} entries to
obfuscate/unobfuscate.
:::

::: option

`--file <file>`

:   

file containing the list of [table.column]{.title-ref} entries to
obfuscate/unobfuscate.
:::

::: option

`--exclude`

:   

comma-separated list of [table.column]{.title-ref} entries not to
obfuscate/unobfuscate.
:::

::: option

`--allfields`

:   

used only when `--unobfuscate`{.interpreted-text role="option"} is
selected.

Try to unobfuscate all fields. It\'s slower than specifying the fields
manually.
:::

::: option

`--vacuum`

:   

used only when `--unobfuscate`{.interpreted-text role="option"} is
selected.

After unobfuscation, completely clear the obfuscated tables and reclaim
unused disk space.
:::

::: option

`--pertablecommit`

:   

commit once per table, after obfuscation.

It avoids big transactions that might get a timeout or face rollback
after an error.
:::

::: option

`-y,--yes`

:   

don\'t ask for manual confirmation.

Only use if you\'re sure that you\'re not going to leak sensible
information by sharing the database to third party without a review.
:::

## [deploy]{.title-ref} - Deploy module remotely {#reference/cmdline/deploy}

::: program
odoo-bin deploy
:::

This command uploads a module to a remote Odoo server and installs it.
It\'s simpler than manually connecting to the remote server, and it does
not require full access to the machine that hosts the Odoo instance,
only the Odoo administrative credentials.

``` console
$ odoo-bin deploy <path> <url> --db <dbname> --login <login> --password <password>
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Prerequisites:

- The server must have the module [base_import_module]{.title-ref}

option)
:::

::: option

`--login <username>`

:   

name of the user with admin rights (default [admin]{.title-ref})
:::

::: option

`--password <password>`

:   

password of the user with admin rights (default [admin]{.title-ref})
:::

::: option

`--verify-ssl`

:   

verify the server\'s SSL certificate, to ensure the target instance is
legit.
:::

::: option

`--force`

:   

re-initialize the module in case it\'s already installed. It will update
[noupdate=\"1\"]{.title-ref} records.
:::

## [upgrade_code]{.title-ref} - Rewrite source code {#reference/cmdline/upgrade_code}

::: program
odoo-bin upgrade_code
:::

This command rewrites the entire source code using the scripts found in
the [odoo/upgrade_code]{.title-ref} folder. It is used for doing the
heavy-lifting when dealing with big code migrations and forward ports.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

All the scripts are doing a best-effort at migrating the source code,
but they are not silver bullets.
::::

It accepts the
`--addons-path <odoo-bin --addons-path>`{.interpreted-text
role="option"} option.

``` console
$ odoo-bin upgrade_code --from 18.0 --to 19.0 --dry-run
```

::: option

`--script <path>`

:   

run a single script
:::

::: option

`--from <version>`

:   

run all script starting from this version included
:::

::: option

`--to <version>`

:

scripts up to this version included. Default is
[odoo.release.version]{.title-ref}.
:::

::: option

`--glob <glob>`

:   

filter the files to be rewritten, default is every file
([\*\*/\*]{.title-ref})
:::

::: option

`--dry-run`

:   

list the files that would be re-written, but do not apply changes
:::

### Code upgrade scripts

The scripts must be named [{version}-{name}.py]{.title-ref}, and must
expose an [upgrade]{.title-ref} function that takes a single
[file_manager]{.title-ref} argument and have no return.

The [file_manager]{.title-ref} argument is a sequence of
[files]{.title-ref}, which have 3 attributes and some helper methods:

- \`path\`: the [pathlib.Path]{.title-ref} where the file is on the file
  system.
- \`addon\`: the addon the file belongs to.
- \`content\`: the re-writtable content of the file (lazy).
- \`print_progress(current, total)\`: outputs the current progress.

::: example
``` python
def upgrade(file_manager):
    files = (file for file in file_manager if file.path.suffix == '.py')
    for fileno, file in enumerate(files, start=1):
        file.content = file.content.replace(..., ...)
        file_manager.print_progress(fileno, len(files))
```

## Configuration

### API Key {#reference/external_api/api_key}

An API key must be set in the `Authorization` request header, as a
bearer token.

Create a new API key for a user via
`Preferences --> Account Security -->
New API Key`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

  -------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  ![image](external_api/preferences2.png){.align-center}   ![image](external_api/account-security2.png){.align-center}   ![image](external_api/new-api-key.png){.align-center}
  -------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------

Both a description and a duration are needed to create a new API key.
The description makes it possible to identify the key, and to determine
later whether the key is still in use or should be removed. The duration
determines the lifetime of the key, after which the key becomes invalid.
It is recommended to set a short duration (typically one day) for
interactive usage. For security reasons, it is not possible to create
keys that last for more than three months. This means that long lasting
keys must be rotated at least once every three months.

The `Generate Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button creates a
strong 160-bits random key. The key value is displayed only once during
creation and cannot be retrieved later. Copy the key immediately and
store it securely. If the key is compromised or lost, delete it
immediately and generate a new one.

Please refer to [OWASP\'s Secrets Management Cheat
Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#secrets-management-cheat-sheet)
for further guidance on the management of API keys.

### Access Rights {#reference/external_api/access_rights}

The JSON-2 API uses the standard
`security models of Odoo <reference/security>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. All operations are validated against the access rights,
record rules and field accesses of the user.

For **interactive usage**, such as discovering the API or running
one-time scripts, it is fine to use a **personal account**.

For **extended automated usage**, such as an integration with another
software, it is recommended to create and use **dedicated bot users**.
Using dedicated bot users has several benefits:

- The minimum required permissions can be granted to the bot, limiting
  the impact if the API key gets compromised.
- The password can be set empty to disable login/password
  authentication, limiting the likelihood of the account getting
  compromised.
- The `reference/fields/automatic/log_access`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} use the bot account. No user is impersonalized.

### Database {#reference/external_api/database}

Depending on the deployment, the `Host` and/or `X-Odoo-Database` request
headers might be required. The `Host` header is required by HTTP/1.1 and
is needed on servers where Odoo is installed next to other web
applications, so that a web-server/reverse-proxy is able to route the
request to the Odoo server. The `X-Odoo-Database` header is required
when a single Odoo server hosts multiple databases and the
`dbfilter`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} wasn\'t configured to use the
`Host` header.

Most HTTP client libraries automatically set the `Host` header using the
connection URL.

## Transaction {#reference/external_api/transaction}

All calls to the JSON-2 endpoint run in their own SQL transaction. The
transaction is committed in case of success and is discarded in case of
error. Using the JSON-2 API, it is not possible to chain multiple calls
inside a single transaction. It means that one must be cautious when
making multiple consecutive calls, as the database might be modified by
other concurrent transactions. This is especially dangerous when
performing operations related to reservations, payments, and such.

The solution is to always call a single method that performs all the
related operations in a single transaction. This way, the data is
guaranteed to stay consistent: either everything is done (success,
commit), or nothing is done (error, rollback).

In the ORM, the `search_read` method is an example of a single method
that performs multiple operations (`search` then `read`) in a single
transaction. If a concurrent request removes one of the records `search`
retrieves, then there is a risk that subsequent calls to `read` fail for
a missing record error. Such a problem cannot occur in `search_read`, as
the system guarantees proper isolation between transactions.

In business models, those methods are often prefixed by `action_`, such
as `sale.order`\'s `action_confirm` method, which verifies that a sales
order is valid before confirming it.

When no method exists for a set of related operations, a new one can be
created in a dedicated module.

## Migrating from XML-RPC / JSON-RPC {#reference/external_api/migration}

Both the XML-RPC and JSON-RPC APIs at endpoints `/xmlrpc`, `/xmlrpc/2`
and `/jsonrpc` are scheduled for removal in Odoo 20 (fall 2026). Both
RPC APIs expose the three same services: common, db (database) and
object. All three services are deprecated.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The other controllers `@route(type='jsonrpc')` (known until Odoo 18 as
`type='json'`) are not subject to this deprecation notice.
::::

### Common service

The common service defines 3 fonctions:

1.  `version()`
2.  `login(db, login, password)`
3.  `authenticate(db, login, password, user_agent_env)`

The version function is replaced by the `/web/version` endpoint.

``` http
GET /web/version HTTP/1.1
```

``` http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"version_info": [19, 0, 0, "final", 0, ""], "version": "19.0"}
```

The two `login` and `authenticate` functions return the user ID
corresponding to the user after a successful login. The user ID and
password are necessary for subsequent RPC calls to the *object* service.
The JSON-2 API uses a different authentication scheme where neither the
user ID nor the password are used. It is still possible to retrieve the
user\'s own ID by sending a JSON-2 request to `res.users/context_get`
with no ID (the current user is extracted from the API key).

### Database service

::: seealso
`db_manager_security`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
:::

The db service defines 13 fonctions:

1.  `create_database(master_pwd, db_name, demo, lang, user_password, login, country_code, phone)`
2.  `duplicate_database(master_pwd, db_original_name, db_name, neutralize_database)`
3.  `drop(master_pwd, db_name)`
4.  `dump(master_pwd, db_name, format)`
5.  `restore(master_pwd, db_name, data, copy)`
6.  `change_admin_password(master_pwd, new_password)`
7.  `rename(master_pwd, old_name, new_name)`
8.  `migrate_databases(master_pwd, databases)`
9.  `db_exist(db_name)`
10. `list()`
11. `list_lang()`
12. `list_countries(master_pwd)`
13. `server_version()`

Many of those function are accessible via the `/web/database`
controllers. Those controllers work hand-in-hand with the HTML form at
`/web/database/manager` and are accessible via HTTP.

The following controllers use the verb `POST` and content-type
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

1.  `/web/database/create` takes inputs `master_pwd`, `name`, `login`,
    `password`, `demo`, `lang`, and `phone`.
2.  `/web/database/duplicate` takes inputs `master_pwd`, `name`,
    `new_name`, and `neutralize_database` (not neutralized by default).
3.  `/web/database/drop` takes inputs `master_pwd` and `name`.
4.  `/web/database/backup` takes inputs `master_pwd`, `name`, and
    `backup_format` (zip by default), and returns the backup in the http
    response.
5.  `/web/database/change_password` takes inputs `master_pwd` and
    `master_pwd_new`.

The following controller uses the verb `POST` and content-type
`multipart/form-data`.

- `/web/database/restore` takes inputs `master_pwd`, `name`, `copy` (not
  copied by default) and `neutralize` (not neutralized by default), it
  takes a file input `backup_file`.

The following controller uses the verb `POST` and content-type
`application/json-rpc`.

- `/web/database/list` takes an empty JSON object as input, and returns
  the database list under the JSON response\'s `result` entry.

The remaining function are: `server_version`, which exists under
`/web/version`, `list_lang`, and `list_countries`, which exist via
JSON-2 on the `res.lang` and `res.country` models, and
`migrate_databases`, which as non-programmable API at the moment.

### Object service

The object service defines 2 fonctions:

1.  `execute(db, uid, passwd, model, method, *args)`
2.  `execute_kw(db, uid, passwd, model, method, args, kw={})`

They both give for access to all public model methods, including the
generic ORM ones.

Both functions are stateless. It means that the database, user ID and
user password are to be provided for each call. The model, method and
arguments must be provided, too. The `execute` function takes as many
extra positional arguments as necessary. The `execute_kw` function takes
an `args` list of positional arguments and an optional `kw` dict of
keyword arguments.

The records IDs are extracted from the first `args`. When the called
method is decorated with `@api.model`, no record ID is extracted, and
`args` is left as-is. It is only possible to give a context with
`execute_kw`, as it is extracted from the keyword argument named
`context`.

::: example
To run the following:

``` python
(env['res.partner']
    .with_user(2)  # admin
    .with_context(lang='en_US')
    .browse([1, 2, 3])
    .read(['name'], load=None)
)
```

Using XML-RPC (JSON-RPC would be similar):

``` python
from xmlrpc.client import ServerProxy
object = ServerProxy(...)
ids = [1, 2, 3]
fields = ['name']
load = None

object.execute("database", 2, "admin", "res.partner", "read", ids, fields, load)
object.execute("database", 2, "admin", "res.partner", "search", [
    ids,
    fields,
], {
    "context": {"lang": "en_US"},
    "load": load,
})
```
:::

The JSON-2 API replaces the object service with a few differences. The
database must only be provided (via the `X-Odoo-Database` HTTP header)
on systems where there are multiple databases available for a same
domain. The login/password authentication scheme is replaced by an API
key (via the `Authorization: bearer` HTTP header). The `model` and
`method` are placed in the URL. The request body is a JSON object with
all the methods arguments, plus `ids` and `context`. All the arguments
are named; there is no way in JSON-2 to call a function with positional
arguments.

::: example
Using JSON-2:

``` python
import requests

DATABSE = ...
DOMAIN = ...
API_KEY = "6578616d706c65206a736f6e20617069206b6579"

requests.post(
    f"https://{DOMAIN}/json/2/res.partner/read",
    headers={
        # "X-Odoo-Database": DATABASE,  # only when DOMAIN isn't enough
        "Authorization": f"bearer {API_KEY}",
    },
    json={
        "ids": [1, 2, 3],
        "context": {"lang": "en_US"},
        "fields": ["name"],
        "load": None,
    },
).json()
```

# External RPC API

::::: danger
::: title
Danger
:::

::: deprecated
19.0
:::

Both the XML-RPC and JSON-RPC APIs at endpoints `/xmlrpc`, `/xmlrpc/2`
and `/jsonrpc` are scheduled for removal in Odoo 20 (fall 2026). The
`external_api`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} acts as a replacement.

The other controllers `@route(type='jsonrpc')` (known until Odoo 18 as
`type='json'`) are not subject to this deprecation notice.
:::::

Odoo is usually extended internally via modules, but many of its
features and all of its data are also available from the outside for
external analysis or integration with various tools. Part of the
`reference/orm/model`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} API is easily
available over [XML-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC) and
accessible from a variety of languages.

Starting with PHP8, the XML-RPC extension may not be available by
default. Check out the
[manual](https://www.php.net/manual/en/xmlrpc.installation.php) for the
installation steps.

Access to data via the external API is only available on *Custom* Odoo
pricing plans. Access to the external API is not available on *One App
Free* or *Standard* plans. For more information visit the [Odoo pricing
page](https://www.odoo.com/pricing-plan) or reach out to your Customer
Success Manager.

## Connection

### Configuration

If you already have an Odoo server installed, you can just use its
parameters.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

For Odoo Online instances (\<domain\>.odoo.com), users are created
without a *local* password (as a person you are logged in via the Odoo
Online authentication system, not by the instance itself). To use
XML-RPC on Odoo Online instances, you will need to set a password on the
user account you want to use:

- Log in your instance with an administrator account.
- Go to `Settings --> Users & Companies --> Users`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}.
- Click on the user you want to use for XML-RPC access.
- Click on `Action`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select
  `Change Password`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- Set a `New Password`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} value then
  click `Change Password`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The *server url* is the instance\'s domain (e.g.
*https://mycompany.odoo.com*), the *database name* is the name of the
instance (e.g. *mycompany*). The *username* is the configured user\'s
login as shown by the *Change Password* screen.

#### API Keys {#api/external_api/keys}

::: versionadded
14.0
:::

Odoo has support for **api keys** and (depending on modules or settings)
may **require** these keys to perform webservice operations.

The way to use API Keys in your scripts is to simply replace your
**password** by the key. The login remains in-use. You should store the
API Key as carefully as the password as they essentially provide the
same access to your user account (although they can not be used to
log-in via the interface).

In order to add a key to your account, simply go to your
`Preferences`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (or
`My Profile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}):

![image](external_api/preferences.png){.align-center}

then open the `Account Security`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
and click `New API Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:

![image](external_api/account-security.png){.align-center}

Input a description for the key, **this description should be as clear
and complete as possible**: it is the only way you will have to identify
your keys later and know whether you should remove them or keep them
around.

Click `Generate Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then copy the
key provided. **Store this key carefully**: it is equivalent to your
password, and just like your password the system will not be able to
retrieve or show the key again later on. If you lose this key, you will
have to create a new one (and probably delete the one you lost).

Once you have keys configured on your account, they will appear above
the `New API Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and you
will be able to delete them:

![image](external_api/delete-key.png){.align-center}

**A deleted API key can not be undeleted or re-set**. You will have to
generate a new key and update all the places where you used the old one.

#### Test database

To make exploration simpler, you can also ask <https://demo.odoo.com>
for a test database:

import xmlrpc.client info =
xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(\'https://demo.odoo.com/start\').start() url,

### Logging in

Odoo requires users of the API to be authenticated before they can query
most data.

The `xmlrpc/2/common` endpoint provides meta-calls which don\'t require
authentication, such as the authentication itself or fetching version
information. To verify if the connection information is correct before
trying to authenticate, the simplest call is to ask for the server\'s
version. The authentication itself is done through the `authenticate`
function and returns a user identifier (`uid`) used in authenticated
calls instead of the login.

common = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(\'{}/xmlrpc/2/common\'.format(url))

## Calling methods {#api/external_api/calling_methods}

The second endpoint is `xmlrpc/2/object`. It is used to call methods of
odoo models via the `execute_kw` RPC function.

Each call to `execute_kw` takes the following parameters:

- the database to use, a string
- the user id (retrieved through `authenticate`), an integer
- the user\'s password, a string
- the model name, a string
- the method name, a string
- an array/list of parameters passed by position
- a mapping/dict of parameters to pass by keyword (optional)

::::::::: example
For instance, to search for records in the `res.partner` model, we can
call `name_search` with `name` passed by position and `limit` passed by
keyword (in order to get maximum 10 results):

:::::::: tabs
::: code-tab
python

models = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(\'{}/xmlrpc/2/object\'.format(url))
models.execute_kw(db, uid, password, \'res.partner\', \'name_search\',
\[\'foo\'\], {\'limit\': 10})
:::

::: code-tab
ruby

models = XMLRPC::Client.new2(\"#{url}/xmlrpc/2/object\").proxy
models.execute_kw(db, uid, password, \'res.partner\', \'name_search\',
\[\'foo\'\], {limit: 10})
:::

::: code-tab

\$models = ripcord::client(\"\$url/xmlrpc/2/object\");

        url)));

    }});

}}; models.execute(\"execute_kw\", asList( db, uid, password,
\"res.partner\", \"name_search\", asList(\"foo\"), new HashMap() {{
put(\"limit\", 10); }} ));

### List records

Records can be listed and filtered via
`~odoo.models.Model.search`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}.

`~odoo.models.Model.search`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} takes a
mandatory `domain <reference/orm/domains>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
filter (possibly empty), and returns the database identifiers of all
records matching the filter.

::::::::: example
To list customer companies, for instance:

### Count records

Rather than retrieve a possibly gigantic list of records and count them,
`~odoo.models.Model.search_count`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} can be
used to retrieve only the number of records matching the query. It takes
the same `domain <reference/orm/domains>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
filter as `~odoo.models.Model.search`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} and
no other parameter.

### Read records

Record data are accessible via the
`~odoo.models.Model.read`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} method, which
takes a list of ids (as returned by
`~odoo.models.Model.search`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}), and
optionally a list of fields to fetch. By default, it fetches all the
fields the current user can read, which tends to be a huge amount.

### List record fields

`~odoo.models.Model.fields_get`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} can be
used to inspect a model\'s fields and check which ones seem to be of
interest.

Because it returns a large amount of meta-information (it is also used
by client programs) it should be filtered before printing, the most
interesting items for a human user are `string` (the field\'s label),
`help` (a help text if available) and `type` (to know which values to
expect, or to send when updating a record).

### Search and read

Because it is a very common task, Odoo provides a
`~odoo.models.Model.search_read`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} shortcut
which, as its name suggests, is equivalent to a
`~odoo.models.Model.search`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} followed by a
`~odoo.models.Model.read`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}, but avoids
having to perform two requests and keep ids around.

Its arguments are similar to
`~odoo.models.Model.search`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}\'s, but it
can also take a list of `fields` (like
`~odoo.models.Model.read`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}, if that list
is not provided it will fetch all fields of matched records).

### Create records

Records of a model are created using
`~odoo.models.Model.create`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}. The method
creates a single record and returns its database identifier.

`~odoo.models.Model.create`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} takes a
mapping of fields to values, used to initialize the record. For any
field which has a default value and is not set through the mapping
argument, the default value will be used.

### Update records

Records can be updated using
`~odoo.models.Model.write`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}. It takes a
list of records to update and a mapping of updated fields to values
similar to `~odoo.models.Model.create`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}.

Multiple records can be updated simultaneously, but they will all get
the same values for the fields being set. It is not possible to perform
\"computed\" updates (where the value being set depends on an existing
value of a record).

:::::::: tabs
::: code-tab
python

models.execute_kw(db, uid, password, \'res.partner\', \'write\',
\[\[id\], {\'name\': \"Newer partner\"}\]) \# get record name after

### Inspection and introspection

While we previously used
`~odoo.models.Model.fields_get`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} to query
a model and have been using an arbitrary model from the start, Odoo
stores most model metadata inside a few meta-models which allow both
querying the system and altering models and fields (with some
limitations) on the fly over XML-RPC.

#### `ir.model` {#reference/webservice/inspection/models}

Provides information about Odoo models via its various fields.

`name`

:   a human-readable description of the model

`model`

:   the name of each model in the system

`state`

:   whether the model was generated in Python code (`base`) or by
    creating an `ir.model` record (`manual`)

`field_id`

:   list of the model\'s fields through a
    `~odoo.fields.One2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"} to
    `reference/webservice/inspection/fields`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

`view_ids`

:   `~odoo.fields.One2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"} to the
    `../reference/user_interface/view_architectures`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} defined for the model

`access_ids`

:   `~odoo.fields.One2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"} relation to
    the `reference/security/acl`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} set on
    the model

`ir.model` can be used to

- Query the system for installed models (as a precondition to operations
  on the model or to explore the system\'s content).
- Get information about a specific model (generally by listing the
  fields associated with it).
- Create new models dynamically over RPC.

:::: important

\* Custom model names must start with `x_`. \* The `state` must be
provided and set to `manual`, otherwise the model will not be loaded. \*
It is not possible to add new *methods* to a custom model, only fields.

    field to create

`state`

:   whether the field was created via Python code (`base`) or via
    `ir.model.fields` (`manual`)

`required`, `readonly`, `translate`

:   enables the corresponding flag on the field

`groups`

:   `field-level access control <reference/security/fields>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, a `~odoo.fields.Many2many`{.interpreted-text

# Extract API

Odoo provides a service to automate the processing of documents of type
**invoices**, **bank statements**, **expenses** or **resumes**.

The service scans documents using an
`OCR (Optical Character Recognition)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
engine and then uses `AI(Artificial Intelligence)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}-based algorithms to extract fields of interest such as the
total, due date, or invoice lines for *invoices*, the initial and final
balances, the date for *bank statements*, the total, date for
*expenses*, or the name, email, phone number for *resumes*.

This service is a paid service. Each document processing will cost you
one credit from your document digitization
`IAP (In-app purchases)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} account. More
information about `IAP (In-app purchases)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} accounts can be found
`here </applications/essentials/in_app_purchase>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

You can either use this service directly in the Accounting, Expense, or
Recruitment App or through the API. The Extract API, which is detailed
in the next section, allows you to integrate our service directly into
your own projects.

## Overview

The extract API uses the
[JSON-RPC2](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) protocol; its
endpoint routes are located at
[https://extract.api.odoo.com]{.title-ref}.

### Version {#extract_api/version}

The version of the Extract API is specified in the route.

The latest versions are:

:   - invoices: 123
    - bank statements: 100
    - expenses: 132
    - applicant: 102

### Flow

The flow is the same for each document type.

1.  | Call `/parse <extract_api/parse>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to
      submit your documents (one call for each document). On success,
      you receive a [document_token]{.title-ref} in the response.

2.  | You then have to regularly poll
      `/get_result <extract_api/get_result>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} to get the document\'s parsing status.
    | Alternatively, you can provide a [webhook_url]{.title-ref} at the
      time of the call to `/parse <extract_api/parse>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} and you will be notified (via a POST request) when the
      result is ready.

The HTTP POST method should be used for all of them. A python
implementation of the full flow for invoices can be found
`here <extract_api/implementation.py>`{.interpreted-text
role="download"} and a token for integration testing is provided in the
`integration testing section <latestextract_api/integration_testing>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

## Parse

Request the digitization of a document. The route will return a
[document_token]{.title-ref} that you can use to fetch the result of
your request.

### Routes {#extract_api/parse}

> - /api/extract/bank_statement/1/parse
> - /api/extract/expense/2/parse
> - /api/extract/applicant/2/parse

The API does not actually use the JSON-RPC error scheme. Instead the API
has its own error scheme bundled inside a successful JSON-RPC result.

### Response

When getting the results from the parse, the detected field vary a lot
depending on the type of document. Each response is a list of
dictionaries, one for each document. The keys of the dictionary are the
name of the field and the value is the value of the field.

#### Common fields

##### `feature_result` {#latestextract_api/get_result/feature_result}

Each field of interest we want to extract from the document such as the
total or the due date are also called **features**. An exhaustive list
of all the extracted features associated to a type of document can be
found in the sections below.

For each feature, we return a list of candidates and we spotlight the
candidate our model predicts to be the best fit for the feature.

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`selected_value` (optional)

:   The best candidate for this feature.

`selected_values` (optional)

:   The best candidates for this feature.

`candidates` (optional)

:   List of all the candidates for this feature ordered by decreasing
    confidence score.

``` js
"feature_name": {
    "selected_value": candidate_12,
    "candidates": [candidate_12, candidate_3, candidate_4, ...]
}
```

##### candidate

For each candidate we give its representation and position in the
document. Candidates are sorted by decreasing order of suitability.

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`content`

:   Representation of the candidate.

`coords`

:   ::: rst-class
    o-definition-list
    :::

    `[center_x, center_y, width, height, rotation_angle]`. The position
    and dimensions are relative to the size of the page and are
    therefore between 0 and 1. The angle is a clockwise rotation
    measured in degrees.

`page`

:   Page of the original document on which the candidate is located
    (starts at 0).

``` js
"candidate": [
    {
        "content": string|float,
        "coords": [float, float, float, float, float],
        "page": int
    },
    ...
]
```

#### Invoices

Invoices are complex and can have a lot of different fields. The
following table gives an exhaustive list of all the fields we can
extract from an invoice.

## Integration Testing {#latestextract_api/integration_testing}

You can test your integration by using *integration_token* as
`account_token` in the `/parse <extract_api/parse>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} request.

Using this token put you in test mode and allows you to simulate the
entire flow without really parsing a document and without being billed
one credit for each successful **document** parsing.

The only technical differences in test mode is that the document you
send is not parsed by the system and that the response you get from
`/get_result <extract_api/get_result>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is
a hard-coded one.

A python implementation of the full flow for invoices can be found
`here <extract_api/implementation.py>`{.interpreted-text
role="download"}.

# Assets {#reference/assets}

Managing assets in Odoo is not as straightforward as it is in some other
apps. One of the reasons is that we have a variety of situations where
some, but not all of the assets are required. For example, the needs of
the web client, the point of sale app, the website or even the mobile
application are different. Also, some assets may be large, but are
seldom needed: in that case we may want them to be
`loaded lazily (on demand) <frontend/assets/lazy_loading>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

## Asset types

There are three different asset types: code ([js]{.title-ref} files),
style ([css]{.title-ref} or [scss]{.title-ref} files) and templates
([xml]{.title-ref} files).

Code

:   Odoo supports
    `three different kinds of javascript files<frontend/js_modules>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}. All these files are then processed (native JS modules
    are transformed into odoo modules), then minified (if not in
    [debug=assets]{.title-ref}
    `mode <frontend/framework/assets_debug_mode>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}) and concatenated. The result is then saved as a file
    attachment. These file attachments are usually loaded via a
    [\<script\>]{.title-ref} tag in the [\<head\>]{.title-ref} part of
    the page (as a static file).

Style

:   Styling can be done with either [css]{.title-ref} or
    [scss](https://sass-lang.com/). Like the javascript files, these
    files are processed ([scss]{.title-ref} files are converted into
    [css]{.title-ref}), then minified (again, if not in
    [debug=assets]{.title-ref}
    `mode <frontend/framework/assets_debug_mode>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}) and concatenated. The result is then saved as a file
    attachment. They are then usually loaded via a
    [\<link\>]{.title-ref} tag in the [\<head\>]{.title-ref} part of the
    page (as a static file).

Template

:   Templates (static [xml]{.title-ref} files) are handled in a
    different way: they are simply read from the file system whenever
    they are needed, and concatenated.

    Whenever the browser loads odoo, it calls the
    [/web/webclient/qweb/]{.title-ref} controller to fetch the
    `templates <reference/qweb>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

It is useful to know that in most cases, a browser only performs a
request the first time it loads a page. This is because each of these
assets are associated with a checksum, which is injected into the page
source. The checksum is then added to the url, which means that it is
possible to safely set the cache headers to a long period.

## Bundles {#reference/assets_bundle}

Odoo assets are grouped by *bundles*. Each bundle (a *list of file
paths* of specific types: [xml]{.title-ref}, [js]{.title-ref},
[css]{.title-ref} or [scss]{.title-ref}) is listed in the
`module manifest <reference/module/manifest>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Files can be declared using
[glob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) syntax, meaning
that you can declare several asset files using a single line.

The bundles are defined in each module\'s
`__manifest__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"}, with a dedicated
[assets]{.title-ref} key which contains a dictionary. The dictionary
maps bundle names (keys) to the list of files they contain (values). It
looks like this:

``` python
'assets': {
    'web.assets_backend': [
        'web/static/src/xml/**/*',
    ],
    'web.assets_common': [
        'web/static/lib/bootstrap/**/*',
        'web/static/src/js/boot.js',
        'web/static/src/js/webclient.js',
        'web/static/src/xml/webclient.xml',
    ],
    'web.assets_unit_tests': [
        'web/static/src/js/webclient.test.js',
    ],
},
```

Here is a list of some important bundles that most odoo developers will
need to know:

- \`web.assets_common\`: this bundle contains most assets which are
  common to the web client, the website and also the point of sale. This
  is supposed to contain lower level building blocks for the odoo
  framework. Note that it contains the `boot.js`{.interpreted-text
  role="file"} file, which defines the odoo module system.
- \`web.assets_backend\`: this bundle contains the code specific to the
  web client (notably the web client/action manager/views/static XML
  templates)
- \`web.assets_frontend\`: this bundle is about all that is specific to
  the public website: ecommerce, portal, forum, blog, \...
- \`web.assets_unit_tests\`: all javascript unit testing code (tests,
  helpers, mocks)

### Operations

Typically, handling assets is simple: you just need to add some new
files to a frequently used bundle like [assets_common]{.title-ref} or
[assets_backend]{.title-ref}. But there are other operations available
to cover some more specific use cases.

Note that all directives targeting a certain asset file (i.e.
[before]{.title-ref}, [after]{.title-ref}, [replace]{.title-ref} and
[remove]{.title-ref}) need that file to be declared beforehand, either
in manifests higher up in the hierarchy or in `ir.asset` records with a
lower sequence.

#### [append]{.title-ref}

This operation adds one or multiple file(s). Since it is the most common
operation, it can be done by simply using the file name:

``` python
'web.assets_common': [
    'my_addon/static/src/js/**/*',
],
```

By default, adding a simple string to a bundle will append the files
matching the glob pattern at the end of the bundle. Obviously, the
pattern may also be directly a single file path.

#### [prepend]{.title-ref}

Add one or multiple file(s) at the beginning of the bundle.

Useful when you need to put a certain file before the others in a bundle
(for example with css files). The [prepend]{.title-ref} operation is
invoked with the following syntax: [(\'prepend\',
\<path\>)]{.title-ref}.

``` python
'web.assets_common': [
    ('prepend', 'my_addon/static/src/css/bootstrap_overridden.scss'),
],
```

#### [before]{.title-ref}

Add one or multiple file(s) before a specific file.

Prepending a file at the beginning of a bundle might not be precise
enough. The [before]{.title-ref} directive can be used to add the given
file(s) right *before* the target file. It is declared by replacing the
normal path with a 3-element tuple [(\'before\', \<target\>,
\<path\>)]{.title-ref}.

``` python
'web.assets_common': [
    ('before', 'web/static/src/css/bootstrap_overridden.scss', 'my_addon/static/src/css/bootstrap_overridden.scss'),
],
```

#### [after]{.title-ref}

Add one or multiple file(s) after a specific file.

Same as [before]{.title-ref}, with the matching file(s) appended right
*after* the target file. It is declared by replacing the normal path
with a 3-element tuple [(\'after\', \<target\>, \<path\>)]{.title-ref}.

``` python
'web.assets_common': [
    ('after', 'web/static/src/css/list_view.scss', 'my_addon/static/src/css/list_view.scss'),
],
```

#### [include]{.title-ref}

Use nested bundles.

The [include]{.title-ref} directive is a way to use a bundle in other
bundles to minimize the size of your manifest. In Odoo we use sub
bundles (prefixed with an underscore by convention) to batch files used
in multiple other bundles. You can then specify the sub bundle as a pair
[(\'include\', \<bundle\>)]{.title-ref} like this:

``` python
'web.assets_common': [
    ('include', 'web._primary_variables'),
],
```

#### [remove]{.title-ref}

Remove one or multiple file(s).

In some cases, you may want to remove one or multiple files from a
bundle. This can be done using the [remove]{.title-ref} directive by
specifying a pair \`(\'remove\', \<target\>)\`:

``` python
'web.assets_common': [
    ('remove', 'web/static/src/js/boot.js'),
],
```

#### [replace]{.title-ref}

Replace an asset file with one or multiple file(s).

Let us say that an asset needs not only to be removed, but you also want
to insert your new version of that asset at the same exact position.
This can be done with the [replace]{.title-ref} directive, using a
3-element tuple \`(\'replace\', \<target\>, \<path\>)\`:

``` python
'web.assets_common': [
    ('replace', 'web/static/src/js/boot.js', 'my_addon/static/src/js/boot.js'),
],
```

### Loading order

The order in which assets are loaded is sometimes critical and must be
deterministic, mostly for stylesheets priorities and setup scripts.
Assets in Odoo are processed as follows:

1.  When an asset bundle is called (e.g.
    [t-call-assets=\"web.assets_common\"]{.title-ref}), an empty list of
    assets is generated
2.  All records of type [ir.asset]{.title-ref} matching the bundle are
    fetched and sorted by sequence number. Then all records with a
    sequence strictly less than 16 are processed and applied to the
    current list of assets.
3.  All modules declaring assets for said bundle in their manifest apply
    their assets operations to this list. This is done following the
    order of modules dependencies (e.g. [web]{.title-ref} assets is
    processed before [website]{.title-ref}). If a directive tries to add
    a file already present in the list, nothing is done for that file.
    In other word, only the first occurrence of a file is kept in the
    list.
4.  The remaining [ir.asset]{.title-ref} records (those with a sequence
    greater than or equal to 16) are then processed and applied as well.

Assets declared in the manifest may need to be loaded in a particular
order, for example `jquery.js`{.interpreted-text role="file"} must be
loaded before all other jquery scripts when loading the lib folder. One
solution would be to create an
`ir.asset <frontend/assets/ir_asset>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
record with a lower sequence or a \'prepend\' directive, but there is
another simpler way to do so.

Since the unicity of each file path in the list of assets is guaranteed,
you can mention any specific file before a glob that includes it. That
file will thus appear in the list before all the others included in the
glob.

``` python
'web.assets_common': [
    'my_addon/static/lib/jquery/jquery.js',
    'my_addon/static/lib/jquery/**/*',
],
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

A module *b* removing/replacing the assets declared in a module *a* will
have to depend on it. Trying to operate on assets that have yet to be
declared will result in an error.
::::

## Lazy loading {#frontend/assets/lazy_loading}

It is sometimes useful to load files and/or asset bundles dynamically,
for example to only load a library once it is needed. To do that, the
Odoo framework provides a few helper functions, located in
`@web/core/assets`{.interpreted-text role="file"}.

``` javascript
await loadAssets({
    jsLibs: ["/web/static/lib/stacktracejs/stacktrace.js"],
});
```

> 
>
> param Object assets
> :   a description of various assets that should be loaded
>
> returns
> :   Promise\<void\>
>
> Load the assets described by the [assets]{.title-ref} parameter. It is
> an object that may contain the following keys:
>
>   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>   Key                     Type                       Description
>   ----------------------- -------------------------- ------------------------------------------
>   [jsLibs]{.title-ref}    [string\[\]]{.title-ref}   a list of urls of javascript files
>
>   [cssLibs]{.title-ref}   [string\[\]]{.title-ref}   a list of urls of css files
>   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> 
>
> param Object assets
> :   a description of various assets that should be loaded
>
> This hook is useful when components need to load some assets in their
> [onWillStart]{.title-ref} method. It internally calls
> [loadAssets]{.title-ref}.

## The asset model ([ir.asset]{.title-ref}) {#frontend/assets/ir_asset}

In most cases the assets declared in the manifest will largely suffice.
Yet for more flexibility, the framework also supports dynamic assets
declared in the database.

This is done by creating [ir.asset]{.title-ref} records. Those will be
processed as if they were found in a module manifest, and they give the
same expressive power as their manifest counterparts.

::: autoclass

o-definition-list
:::

[name]{.title-ref}

:   Name of the asset record (for identification purpose).

[bundle]{.title-ref}

# Error handling

In programming, error handling is a complex topic with many pitfalls,
and it can be even more daunting when you\'re writing code within the
constraints of a framework, as the way you handle errors needs to mesh
with the way the framework dispatches errors and vice versa.

This article paints the broad strokes of how errors are handled by the
JavaScript framework and Owl, and gives some recommendations on how to
interface with these systems in a way that avoids common problems.

## Errors in JavaScript

Before we dive into how errors are handled in Odoo as well as how and
where to customize error handling behavior, it\'s a good idea to make
sure we\'re on the same page when it comes to what we mean exactly by
\"error\", as well as some of the peculiarities of error handling in
JavaScript.

### The [Error]{.title-ref} class

The first thing that may come to mind when we talk about error handling
is the built-in [Error]{.title-ref} class, or classes that extend it. In
the rest of this article, when we refer to an object that is an instance
of this class, we will use the term *Error object* in italics.

### Anything can be thrown

In JavaScript, you can throw any value. It is customary to throw *Error
objects*, but it is possible to throw any other object, and even
primitives. While we don\'t recommend that you ever throw anything that
is not an *Error object*, the Odoo JavaScript framework needs to be able
to deal with these scenarios, which will help you understand some design
decisions that we\'ve had to make.

When instanciating an *Error object*, the browser collects information
about the current state of the \"call stack\" (either a proper call
stack, or a reconstructed call stack for async functions and promise
continuations). This information is called a \"stack trace\" and is very
useful for debugging. The Odoo framework displays this stack trace in
error dialogs when available.

When throwing a value that is not an *Error object*, the browser still
collects information about the current call stack, but this information
is not available in JavaScript: it is only available in the devtools
console if the error is not handled.

Throwing *Error objects* enables us to show more detailed information,
which a user will be able to copy/paste if needed for a bug report, but
it also makes error handling more robust as it allows us to filter
errors based on their class when handling them. Unfortunately,
JavaScript does not have syntactic support for filtering by error class
in the catch clause, but you can relatively easily do it yourself:

``` javascript
try {
  doStuff();
} catch (e) {
  if (!(e instanceof MyErrorClass)) {
    throw e; // caught an error we can't handle, rethrow
  }
  // handle MyErrorClass
}
```

### Promise rejections are errors

During the early days of Promise adoption, Promises were often treated
as a way to store a disjoint union of a result and an \"error\", and it
was pretty common to use a Promise rejection as a way to signal a soft
failure. While it might seem like a good idea at first glance, browsers
and JavaScript runtimes have long started to treat rejected Promises the
same way as thrown errors in pretty much every way:

- throwing in an async function has the same effect as returning a
  Promise that is rejected with the thrown value as its rejection
  reason.
- catch blocks in async functions catch rejected Promises that were
  awaited in the corresponding try block.
- runtimes collect stack information about rejected promises.
- a rejected Promise that is not caught synchronously dispatches an
  event on the global/window object, and if [preventDefault]{.title-ref}
  is not called on the event, browsers log an error, and standalone
  runtimes like node kill the process.
- the debugger feature \"pause on exceptions\" pauses when Promises are
  rejected

For these reasons, the Odoo framework treats rejected Promises in the
exact same way as thrown errors. Do not create rejected promises in
places where you would not throw an error, and always reject Promises
with *Error objects* as their rejection reason.

### [error]{.title-ref} events are not errors

With the exception of [error]{.title-ref} events on the window,
[error]{.title-ref} events on other objects such as
[\<media\>]{.title-ref}, [\<audio\>]{.title-ref} [\<img\>]{.title-ref},
[\<script\>]{.title-ref} and [\<link\>]{.title-ref} elements, or
XMLHttpRequest objects are not errors. For the purpose of this article,
\"error\" specifically refers only to thrown values and rejected
promises. If you need to handle errors on these elements or want them to
be treated as errors, you need to explicitly add an event listener for
said event:

``` javascript
const scriptEl = document.createElement("script");
scriptEl.src = "https://example.com/third_party_script.js";
return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  scriptEl.addEventListener("error", reject);
  scriptEl.addEventListener("load", resolve);
  document.head.append(scriptEl);
});
```

## Lifecycle of errors within the Odoo JS framework

Thrown errors unwind their call stack to find a catch clause that can
handle them. The way an error is handled depends on what code is
encountered while unwinding the call stack. While there are a virtually
infinite number of places errors could be thrown from, there are only a
few possible paths into the JS framework\'s error handling code.

### Throwing an error at the top-level of a module

When a JS module is loaded, the code at the top level of that module is
executed and may throw. While the framework might report these errors
with a dialog, module loading is a critical moment for the JavaScript
framework and some modules throwing errors might prevent the framework
code from booting entirely, so any error reporting at this stage is
\"best effort\". Errors thrown during module loading should however
always at the very least log an error message in the browser console.
Because this type of error is critical, there is no way for the
application to recover and you should write your code in such a way that
it\'s impossible for the module to throw during definition. Any error
handling and reporting that does happen at this stage is purely with the
objective of helping you, the developer, fix the code that threw the
error, and we provide no mechanism to customize how these errors are
handled.

### The error service

When an error is thrown but never caught, the runtime dispatches an
event on the global object ([window]{.title-ref}). The type of the event
depends on whether the error was thrown synchronously or asynchronously:
synchronously thrown errors dispatch an [error]{.title-ref} event, and
errors thrown from within an asynchronous context as well as rejected
Promises dispatch an [unhandledrejection]{.title-ref} event.

The JS framework contains a service that is dedicated to handling these
events: the error service. When receiving one of these events, the error
service starts by creating a new *Error object* that is used to wrap the
error that was thrown; this is because any value can be thrown, and
Promises can be rejected with any value, including
[undefined]{.title-ref} or [null]{.title-ref}, meaning that it\'s not
guaranteed that it contains any information, or that we can store any
information on that value. The wrapping *Error object* is used to
collect some information about the thrown value so that it can be used
uniformly in the framework code that needs to display information about
errors of any type.

The error service stores a complete stack trace of the thrown error on
this wrapper *Error object* and, when the debug mode is
[assets]{.title-ref}, uses the source maps to add information in this
stack trace about the source file that contains the function of each
stack frame. The position of the function in the bundled assets is kept,
as it can be useful is some scenarios. When errors have a
[cause]{.title-ref}, this process also unwinds the [cause]{.title-ref}
chain to build a complete composite stack trace. While the
[cause]{.title-ref} field on *Error objects* is standard, some major
browsers still do not display the full stack trace of error chains.
Because of this, we add this information manually. This is particularly
useful when errors are thrown within Owl hooks, more on that later.

Once the wrapper error contains all the required information, we start
the process of actually handling the error. To do this, the error
service successively calls all functions registered in the
[error_handlers]{.title-ref} registry, until one of these functions
returns a truthy value, which signals that the error has been handled.
After this, if [preventDefault]{.title-ref} was not called on the error
event, and if the error service was able to add a stack trace on the
wrapper error object, the error service calls
[preventDefault]{.title-ref} on the error event, and logs the stack
trace in the console. This is because, as previously mentioned, some
browsers do not display error chains correctly, and the default
behaviour of the event is the browser logging the error, so we simply
override that behaviour to log a more complete stack trace. If the error
service was not able to collect stack trace information about the thrown
error, we do not call [preventDefault]{.title-ref}. This can happen when
throwing non-error values: strings, undefined or other random objects.
In those cases, the browser logs the stack trace itself, as it has that
information but does not expose it to the JS code.

### The [error_handlers]{.title-ref} registry

The [error_handlers]{.title-ref} registry is the main way to extend the
way that the JS framework handles \"generic\" errors. Generic errors, in
this context, means errors that can happen in many places, but that
should be handled uniformly. Some examples:

- UserError: when the user attempts to perform an operation that the
  python code deems invalid for business reasons, the python code raises
  a UserError, and the rpc function throws a corresponding error in
  JavaScript. This has the potential to happen on any rpc anywhere, and
  we do not want developers to have to handle this kind of error
  explicitly in all those places, and we want the same behavior to
  happen everywhere: stop the currently executing code (which is
  achieved by the throw), and display a dialog that explains to the user
  what went wrong.
- AccessError: same reasoning as for user errors: it can happen at any
  point and should be displayed the same way regardless of where it
  happens
- LostConnection: same reasoning again.

### Throwing an error in an Owl component

Registering or modifying Owl components is the main way in which you can
extend the functionality of the web client. As such, most errors that
are thrown are in one way or another thrown from an Owl component. There
are a few possible scenarios:

- Throwing in the component\'s setup or during rendering
- Throwing from within a lifecycle hook
- Throwing from an event handler

Throwing an error from an event handler or a function or method called
directly or indirectly from an event handler means that neither Owl\'s
code nor the JS framework\'s code is in the call stack. If you don\'t
catch the error, it lands directly in the error service.

When throwing an error in a component\'s setup or during rendering, Owl
catches the error and goes up the component hierarchy, allowing
components that have registered error handlers with the
[onError]{.title-ref} hook to attempt to handle the error. If the error
is not handled by any of them, Owl destroys the application as it is
likely in a corrupted state.

::: seealso
[Error handling in the Owl
documentation](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/reference/error_handling.md)
:::

Inside Odoo, there are some places where we do not want the entire
application to crash in case of error, and so the framework has a few
places where it uses the [onError]{.title-ref} hook. The action service
wraps actions and views in a component that handles errors. If a client
action or view throws an error during rendering, it attempts to go back
to the previous action. The error is dispatched to the error service so
that an error dialog can be shown regardless. A similar strategy is used
in most places where the framework calls into \"user\" code: we
generally stop displaying the faulty component an show an error dialog.

When throwing an error inside of a hook\'s callback function, Owl
creates a new *Error object* that contains stack information about where
the hook was registered, and sets its cause as the originally thrown
value. This is because the stack trace of the original error contains no
information about which component registered this hook and where, it
only contains information about what called the hook. Because hooks are
called by Owl code, most of this information is *generally* not very
useful for developers, but knowing where the hook was registered and by
which component is very useful.

When reading errors that mention \"OwlError: the following error
occurred in \<hookName\>\", make sure to read both parts of the
composite stack trace:

``` {emphasize-lines="4,12"}
Error: The following error occurred in onMounted: "My error"
  at wrapError
  at onMounted
  at MyComponent.setup
  at new ComponentNode
  at Root.template
  at MountFiber._render
  at MountFiber.render
  at ComponentNode.initiateRender

Caused by: Error: My error
  at ParentComponent.someMethod
  at MountFiber.complete
  at Scheduler.processFiber
  at Scheduler.processTasks
```

The first highlighted line tells you which component registered the
[onMounted]{.title-ref} hook, while the second highlighted line tells
you which function threw the error. In this case, a child component is
calling a function it received as prop from its parent, and that
function is a method of the parent component. Both pieces of information
can be useful, as the method could have been called by mistake by the
child (or at a point in the lifecycle where it shouldn\'t), but it could
also be that the parent\'s method contains a bug.

### Marking errors as handled

In the previous sections, we talked about two ways to register error
handlers: one is adding them to the [error_handlers]{.title-ref}
registry, the other is using the [onError]{.title-ref} hook in owl. In
both cases, the handler has to decide whether to mark the error as
handled.

#### [onError]{.title-ref}

In the case of a handler registered in Owl with [onError]{.title-ref},
the error is considered by Owl as handled unless you rethrow it.
Whatever you do in [onError]{.title-ref}, the user interface is likely
not synchronized with the state of the application, as the error
prevented owl from completing some work. If you are unable to handle the
error, you should rethrow it, and let the rest of the code handle it.

If you don\'t rethrow the error, you need to change some state so that
the application can render again in a non-erroring way. At this point,
if you don\'t rethrow the error it will not be reported. In some cases
this is desirable, but in most cases, what you should do instead is
dispatch this error in a separate call stack outside of Owl. The easiest
way to do this is to simply create a rejected Promise with the error as
its rejection reason:

``` javascript
import { Component, onError } from "@odoo/owl";
class MyComponent extends Component {
  setup() {
    onError((error) => {
      // implementation of this method is left as an exercise for the reader
      this.removeErroringSubcomponent();
      Promise.reject(error); // create a rejected Promise without passing it anywhere
    });
  }
}
```

This causes the browser to dispatch an [unhandledrejection]{.title-ref}
event on the window, which causes the JS framework\'s error handling to
kick in and deal with the error, in most cases by opening a dialog with
information about the error. This is the strategy that is used
internally by the action service and dialog service to stop rendering
broken actions or dialogs while still reporting the error.

#### Handler in the [error_handlers]{.title-ref} registry

Handlers that are added to the [error_handlers]{.title-ref} registry can
mark an error as being handled in two ways, with different meanings.

The first way is that the handler can return a truthy value, this means
that the handler has processed the error and made something happen
because the error it received matched the type of error it is able to
handle. This generally means it has opened a dialog or notification to
warn the user about the error. This prevents the error service from
calling the following handlers with higher sequence number.

The other way is to call [preventDefault]{.title-ref} on the error
event: this has a different meaning. After deciding that it is able to
handle the error, the handler needs to decide if the error it received
is something that is allowed to happen during normal operation and if it
is, it should call [preventDefault]{.title-ref}. This is generally
applicable to business errors such as an access errors or validation
errors: users can share links with other users to ressources to which
they do not have acces, and users can attempt to save a record that\'s
in an invalid state.

When not calling [preventDefault]{.title-ref}, the error is treated as
unexpected, any such occurrence during a test causes the test to fail,
as it\'s generally indicative of defective code.

## Avoid throwing errors as much as possible

Errors introduce complexity in many ways, here are some reasons why you
should avoid throwing them.

### Errors are expensive

Because errors need to unwind the callstack and collect information as
they do so, throwing errors is slow. Additionally, JavaScript runtimes
are generally optimized with the assumption that exceptions are rare,
and as such generally compiles the code with the assumption that it
doesn\'t throw, and fall back to a slower code path if it ever does.

### Throwing errors makes debugging harder

JavaScript debuggers, like the one included in the Chrome and Firefox
devtools for example, have a feature that allows you to pause the
execution when an exception is thrown. You can also choose whether to
pause only on caught exceptions, or on both caught and uncaught
exceptions.

When you throw an error inside of code that is called by Owl or by the
JavaScript framework (e.g. in a field, view, action, component, \...),
because they manage resources, they need to catch errors and inspect
them to decide whether the error is critical and the application should
crash, or if the error is expected and should be handled in a particular
manner.

Because of this, almost all errors that are thrown within JavaScript
code are caught at some point, and although they may be rethrown if they
cannot be handled, this means that using the \"pause on uncaught
exceptions\" feature is effectively useless while working within Odoo,
as it always pauses within the JavaScript framework code, instead of
near the code that threw the error originally.

However, the \"pause on caught exceptions\" feature is still very
useful, as it pauses execution on every throw statement and rejected
promise. This allows the developer to stop and inspect the execution
context whenever an exceptional situation occurs.

However, this is only true assuming that exceptions are rarely thrown.
If exceptions are thrown routinely, any action within the page can cause
the debugger to stop the execution, and the developer might need to step
through many \"routine\" exceptions before they can get to the actual
exceptional scenario they are interested in. In some situations, because
clicking the play button in the debugger removes focus from the page, it
may even make the interesting throw scenario inaccessible without using
the keyboard shortcut for resuming execution which results in poor
developer experience.

### Throwing breaks the normal flow of the code

When throwing an error, code that looks like it should always execute
may be skipped, this can cause many subtle bugs and memory leaks. Here
is a simple example:

``` javascript
eventTarget.addEventListener("event", handler);
someFunction();
eventTarget.removeEventListener("event", handler);
```

In this block of code, we add an event listener to an event target, then
call a function which may dispatch events on that target. After the
function call, we remove the event listener.

If [someFunction]{.title-ref} throws, the event listener will never be
removed. This means that the memory associated with this event listener
is effectively leaked and will never be freed unless the eventTarget
itself gets deallocated.

On top of the memory being leaked, the handler still being attached
means that it may be called for events being dispatched for reasons
other than the call to [someFunction]{.title-ref}. This is a bug.

To account for this, one would need to wrap the call in a
[try]{.title-ref} block, and the cleanup in a [finally]{.title-ref}
block:

``` javascript
eventTarget.addEventListener("event", handler);
try {
  someFunction();
} finally {
  eventTarget.removeEventListener("event", handler);
}
```

While this now avoids the problems mentioned above, not only does this
require more code, it also requires knowledge that the function may
throw. It would be unmanageable to wrap all code that may throw in a
[try/finally]{.title-ref} block.

## Catching errors

Sometimes, you need to call into code that is known to throw errors and
you want to handle some of these errors. There are two important things
to keep in mind:

- Rethrow errors that are not the type of error you expect. This should
  generally be done with and [instanceof]{.title-ref} check
- Keep the try block as small as possible. This avoid catching errors
  that are not the one you\'re trying to catch. Generally, the try block
  should contain exactly *one* statement.

``` javascript
let someVal;
try {
  someVal = someFunction();
  // do not start working with someVal here.
} catch (e) {
  if (!(e instanceof MyError)) {
    throw e;
  }
  someVal = null;
}
// start working with someVal here
```

While this is straightforward with try/catch, it\'s much easier to
accidentally wrap a much larger portion of code in a catch clause when
working with \`Promise.catch\`:

``` javascript
someFunction().then((someVal) => {
  // work with someVal
}).catch((e) => {
  if (!(e instanceof MyError)) {
    throw e;
  }
  return null;
});
```

In this example, the catch block is actually catching errors in the
entire then block, which is not what we want. In this particular
example, because we properly filter based on the error type, we\'re not
swallowing the error, but you can see that it may be much easier to do
so if we\'re expecting a single error type and decide not to have the
instanceof check. Notice however that unlike the previous example, the
null isn\'t going through the codepath that uses [someVal]{.title-ref}.
To avoid this, catch clauses should generally be as close as possible to
the promise that may throw, and should always filter on the error type.

## Error free control flow

For the reasons outlined above, you should avoid throwing errors for
doing routine things, and in particular, for control flow. If a function
is expected to be unable to complete its work on a regular basis, it
should communicate that failure without throwing an exception. Consider
the example code:

``` javascript
let someVal;
try {
  someVal = someFunction();
} catch (e) {
  if (!(e instanceof MyError)) {
    throw e;
  }
  someVal = null;
}
```

There are many things that are problematic with this code. First,
because we want the variable [someVal]{.title-ref} to be accessible
after the [try/catch]{.title-ref} block, it needs to be declared before
that block, and it cannot be [const]{.title-ref} since it needs to be
assigned after initialization. This hurts readability further down the
road as you now have to look out for this variable potentially being
reassigned later in the code.

Second, when we catch the error, we have to check that the error is
actually the type of error we were expecting to catch, and if not,
rethrow the error. If we don\'t do this, we might end up swallowing
errors that were *actually* unexpected instead of reporting them
correctly, e.g. we could be catching and swallowing a TypeError if the
underlying code tries to access a property on [null]{.title-ref} or
[undefined]{.title-ref}.

Lastly, not only is this very verbose, but it\'s easy to do this
incorrectly: if you forget to add the [try/catch]{.title-ref}, you are
likely to end up with a traceback. If you add the
[try/catch]{.title-ref} block but forget to rethrow unexpected errors,
you are swallowing unrelated errors. And if you want to avoid having to
reassign the variable you may move the entire block that uses the
variable inside the [try]{.title-ref} block. The more code you have
inside your [try]{.title-ref} block, the more likely you are to catch
unrelated errors, and swallow them if you forgot to filter by error
type. It also adds an indentation level to the entire block, and you may
even end up with nested [try/catch]{.title-ref} blocks. Lastly, it makes
it harder to identify which line is actually expected to throw the
error.

The following sections outline some alternative approaches you can use
instead of using errors.

### Return [null]{.title-ref} or [undefined]{.title-ref}

If the function returns a primitive or an object, you can generally use
[null]{.title-ref} or [undefined]{.title-ref} to signal that it was
unable to do its intended job. This suffices in most cases. The code
ends up looking something like this:

``` javascript
const someVal = someFunction();
// further
if (someVal !== null) { /* do something */ }
```

As you can see, this is much simpler.

### Return an object or array

In some cases, a value of [null]{.title-ref} or [undefined]{.title-ref}
is part of the expected return values. In those cases, you can instead
return a wrapper object or a two-element array that contains either the
return value or the error:

``` javascript
const { val: someVal, err } = someFunction();
if (err) {
  return;
}
// do something with someVal as it is known to be valid
```

Or with an array:

``` javascript
const [err, someVal] = someFunction();
if (err) {
  return;
}
// do something with someVal as it is known to be valid
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When using a two-element array, it is advisable to have the error be the
first element, so that it is harder to ignore by mistake when
destructuring. One would need to explicitly add a placeholder or comma
to skip the error, whereas if the error is the second element, it is
easy to simply destructure only the first element and mistakenly forget
to handle the error.
::::

## When to throw errors

The previous sections give many good reasons to avoid throwing errors,
so what are some examples of cases where throwing an error is the best
course of action?

- Generic errors that can happen in many places but should be treated
  the same everywhere; e.g., access errors can happen on basically any
  RPC, and we always want to display information about why the user
  doesn\'t have access.
- Some precondition that should always be fulfilled for some operation
  is not fulfilled; e.g., a view couldn\'t be rendered because the
  domain is invalid. These types of error are generally not intended to
  be caught anywhere and signal that code is incorrect or data is
  corrupted. Throwing forces the framework to bail out and prevents
  operating in a broken state.
- When traversing some deep data structure recursively, throwing an
  error can be more ergonomic and less error prone than having to
  manually test for errors and forward them through many levels of
  calls. This should be very rare in practice, and needs to be weighed
  against all the disadvantages mentioned in this article.

# Framework Overview

## Introduction

The Odoo Javascript framework is a set of features/building blocks
provided by the `web/` addon to help build odoo applications running in
the browser. At the same time, the Odoo Javascript framework is a single
page application, usually known as the *web client* (available at the
url `/web`).

The web client started as an application made with a custom class and
widget system, but it is now transitioning to using native javascript
classes instead, and Owl as a component system. This explains why both
systems are currently in use in the codebase.

From a high-level perspective, the web client is a single-page
application: it does not need to request a full page from the server
each time the user performs an action. Instead, it only requests what it
needs and then replaces/updates the current screen accordingly. Also, it
manages the url to keep it in sync with the current state.

The javascript framework (all or some parts) is also used in other
situations, such as the Odoo website or the point of sale. This
reference is mostly focused on the web client.

:::: note
::: title
Note

It is common in the Odoo ecosystem to see the words *frontend* and
*backend* as synonyms for the odoo website (public) and the web client,
respectively. This terminology is not to be confused with the more
common use of browser-code (frontend) and server (backend).
::::

:::: note

Note

In this documentation, the word *component* always refers to new Owl
components, and *widget* refers to old Odoo widgets.
::::

All new development should be done in Owl, if possible!
::::

## Code structure

The `web/static/src` folder contains all the `web/` javascript (and css
and templates) codebase. Here is a list of the most important folders:

- `core/` most of the low level features
- `fields/` all field components
- `views/` all javascript views components (`form`, `list`, \...)
- `search/` control panel, search bar, search panel, \...
- `webclient/` the web client specific code: navbar, user menu, action
  service, \...

The `web/static/src` is the root folder. Everything inside can simply be
imported by using the `@web` prefix. For example, here is how one can
import the `memoize` function located in
`web/static/src/core/utils/functions`:

``` javascript
import { memoize } from "@web/core/utils/functions";
```

## WebClient Architecture

As mentioned above, the web client is an owl application. Here is a
slightly simplified version of its template:

``` xml
<t t-name="web.WebClient">
    <body class="o_web_client">
        <NavBar/>
        <ActionContainer/>
        <MainComponentsContainer/>
    </body>
</t>
```

As we can see, it basically is a wrapper for a navbar, the current
action and some additional components. The `ActionContainer` is a higher
order component that will display the current action controller (so, a
client action, or a specific view in the case of actions of type
`act_window`). Managing actions is a huge part of its work: the action
service keeps in memory a stack of all active actions (represented in
the breadcrumbs), and coordinates each change.

Another interesting thing to note is the `MainComponentsContainer`: it
is simply a component that displays all components registered in the
`main_components` registry. This is how other parts of the system can
extend the web client.

## Environment {#frontend/framework/environment}

As an Owl application, the Odoo web client defines its own environment
(components can access it using `this.env`). Here is a description of
what Odoo adds to the shared `env` object:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Key                      Value
  ------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------
  [qweb]{.title-ref}       required by Owl (contains all templates)

  [bus]{.title-ref}        `main bus <frontend/framework/bus>`{.interpreted-text
                           role="ref"}, used to coordinate some generic events

  [services]{.title-ref}   all deployed `services <frontend/services>`{.interpreted-text
                           role="ref"} (should usually be accessed with the
                           [useService]{.title-ref} hook)

  [debug]{.title-ref}      string. If non empty, the web client is in
                           `debug mode <frontend/framework/debug_mode>`{.interpreted-text
                           role="ref"}

  [\_t]{.title-ref}        translation function

  [isSmall]{.title-ref}    boolean. If true, the web client is currently in mobile mode
                           (screen width \<= 767px)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, for example, to translate a string in a component (note: templates
are automatically translated, so no specific action is required in that
case), one can do this:

``` javascript
const someString = this.env._t('some text');
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Having a reference to the environment is quite powerful, because it
provides access to all services. This is useful in many cases: for
example, user menu items are mostly defined as a string, and a function
taking the [env]{.title-ref} as unique argument. This is enough to
express all user menu needs.
::::

## Building Blocks

Most of the web client is built with a few types of abstractions:
registries, services, components and hooks.

### Registries

`Registries <frontend/registries>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are
basically a simple key/value mapping that stores some specific kind of
objects. They are an important part of the extensibility of the UI: once
some object is registered, the rest of the web client can use it. For
example, the field registry contains all field components (or widgets)
that can be used in views.

``` javascript
import { Component } from "@odoo/owl";
import { registry } from "./core/registry";

class MyFieldChar extends Component {
    // some code
}

registry.category("fields").add("my_field_char", MyFieldChar);
```

Note that we import the main registry from `@web/core/registry` then
open the sub registry `fields`.

### Services

`Services <frontend/services>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are long
lived pieces of code that provide a feature. They may be imported by
components (with `useService`) or by other services. Also, they can
declare a set of dependencies. In that sense, services are basically a
DI (dependency injection) system. For example, the `notification`
service provides a way to display a notification, or the `rpc` service
is the proper way to perform a request to the Odoo server.

The following example registers a simple service that displays a
notification every 5 second:

``` javascript
import { registry } from "./core/registry";

const serviceRegistry = registry.category("services");

const myService = {
    dependencies: ["notification"],
    start(env, { notification }) {
        let counter = 1;
        setInterval(() => {
            notification.add(`Tick Tock ${counter++}`);
        }, 5000);
    }
};

serviceRegistry.add("myService", myService);
```

### Components and Hooks

`Components <frontend/components>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`hooks <frontend/hooks>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are ideas coming
from the [Owl component
system](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/readme.md). Odoo
components are simply owl components that are part of the web client.

[Hooks](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/reference/hooks.md)
are a way to factorize code, even if it depends on lifecycle. This is a
composable/functional way to inject a feature in a component. They can
be seen as a kind of mixin.

``` javascript
function useCurrentTime() {
    const state = useState({ now: new Date() });
    const update = () => state.now = new Date();
    let timer;
    onWillStart(() => timer = setInterval(update, 1000));
    onWillUnmount(() => clearInterval(timer));
    return state;
}
```

## Context

An important concept in the Odoo javascript is the *context*: it
provides a way for code to give more context to a function call or a
rpc, so other parts of the system can properly react to that
information. In some way, it is like a bag of information that is
propagated everywhere. It is useful in some situations, such as letting
the Odoo server know that a model rpc comes from a specific form view,
or activating/disabling some features in a component.

There are two different contexts in the Odoo web client: the *user
context* and the *action context* (so, we should be careful when using
the word *context*: it could mean a different thing depending on the
situation).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The [context]{.title-ref} object may be useful in many cases, but one
should be careful not to overuse it! Many problems can be solved in a
standard way without modifying the context.
::::

### User Context {#frontend/framework/user_context}

The *user context* is a small object containing various informations
related to the current user. It is available through the
[user]{.title-ref} service:

``` javascript
class MyComponent extends Component {
    setup() {
        const user = useService("user");
        console.log(user.context);
    }
}
```

It contains the following information:

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Name                                Type                       Description
  ----------------------------------- -------------------------- ------------------------------------------
  [allowed_company_ids]{.title-ref}   [number\[\]]{.title-ref}   the list of active company ids for the
                                                                 user

  [lang]{.title-ref}                  [string]{.title-ref}       the user language code (such as \"en_us\")

  [tz]{.title-ref}                    [string]{.title-ref}       the user current timezone (for example
                                                                 \"Europe/Brussels\")
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In practice, the [orm]{.title-ref} service automatically adds the user
context to each of its requests. This is why it is usually not necessary
to import it directly in most cases.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The first element of the [allowed_company_ids]{.title-ref} is the main
company of the user.
::::

### Action Context

The `ir.actions.act_window<reference/actions/window>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and
`ir.actions.client<reference/actions/client>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} support an optional [context]{.title-ref} field. This field
is a [char]{.title-ref} that represents an object. Whenever the
corresponding action is loaded in the web client, this context field
will be evaluated as an object and given to the component that
corresponds to the action.

``` xml
<field name="context">{'search_default_customer': 1}</field>
```

It can be used in many different ways. For example, the views add the
action context to every requests made to the server. Another important
use is to activate some search filter by default (see example above).

Sometimes, when we execute new actions manually (so, programmatically,
in javascript), it is useful to be able to extend the action context.
This can be done with the [additional_context]{.title-ref} argument.

``` javascript
// in setup
let actionService = useService("action");

// in some event handler
actionService.doAction("addon_name.something", {
    additional_context:{
        default_period_id: defaultPeriodId
    }
});
```

In this example, the action with xml_id
[addon_name.something]{.title-ref} will be loaded, and its context will
be extended with the [default_period_id]{.title-ref} value. This is a
very important usecase that lets developers combine actions together by
providing some information to the next action.

## Python Interpreter {#frontend/framework/pyjs}

The Odoo framework features a built-in small python interpreter. Its
purpose is to evaluate small python expressions. This is important,
because views in Odoo have modifiers written in python, but they need to
be evaluated by the browser.

Example:

``` javascript
import { evaluateExpr } from "@web/core/py_js/py";

evaluateExpr("1 + 2*{'a': 1}.get('b', 54) + v", { v: 33 }); // returns 142
```

The `py` javascript code exports 5 functions:

> 
>
> param string expr
> :   the expression to tokenize
>
> returns
> :   Token\[\] a list of token

> 
>
> param Token\[\] tokens
> :   a list of tokens
>
> returns
> :   AST an abstract syntax tree structure representing the expression

> 
>
> param string expr
> :   a string representing a valid python expression
>
> returns
> :   AST an abstract syntax tree structure representing the expression

> 
>
> param AST ast
> :   a AST structure that represents an expression
>
> param Object context
> :   an object that provides an additional evaluation context
>
> returns
> :   any the resulting value of the expression, with respect to the
>     context

> 
>
> param string expr
> :   a string representing a valid python expression
>
> param Object context
> :   an object that provides an additional evaluation context
>
> returns
> :   any the resulting value of the expression, with respect to the
>     context

## Domains {#frontend/framework/domains}

Broadly speaking, domains in Odoo represent a set of records that
matches some specified conditions. In javascript, they are usually
represented either as a list of conditions (or of operators:
[\|]{.title-ref}, [&]{.title-ref} or [!]{.title-ref} in prefix
notation), or as string expressions. They don\'t have to be normalized
(the [&]{.title-ref} operator is implied if necessary). For example:

``` javascript
// list of conditions
[]
[["a", "=", 3]]
[["a", "=", 1], ["b", "=", 2], ["c", "=", 3]]
["&", "&", ["a", "=", 1], ["b", "=", 2], ["c", "=", 3]]
["&", "!", ["a", "=", 1], "|", ["a", "=", 2], ["a", "=", 3]]

// string expressions
"[('some_file', '>', a)]"
"[('date','>=', (context_today() - datetime.timedelta(days=30)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))]"
"[('date', '!=', False)]"
```

String expressions are more powerful than list expressions: they can
contain python expressions and unevaluated values, that depends on some
evaluation context. However, manipulating string expressions is more
difficult.

Since domains are quite important in the web client, Odoo provides a
[Domain]{.title-ref} class:

``` javascript
new Domain([["a", "=", 3]]).contains({ a: 3 }) // true

const domain = new Domain(["&", "&", ["a", "=", 1], ["b", "=", 2], ["c", "=", 3]]);
domain.contains({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }); // true
domain.contains({ a: -1, b: 2, c: 3 }); // false

// next expression returns ["|", ("a", "=", 1), ("b", "<=", 3)]
Domain.or([[["a", "=", 1]], "[('b', '<=', 3)]"]).toString();
```

Here is the [Domain]{.title-ref} class description:

> 
>
> param descr
> :   a domain description
>
> type descr
> :   string \| any\[\] \| Domain
>
> > 
> >
> > param Object record
> > :   a record object
> >
> > returns
> > :   boolean
> >
> > Returns true if the record matches all the condition specified by
> > the domain
>
> > 
> >
> > returns
> > :   string
> >
> > Returns a string description for the domain
>
> > 
> >
> > param Object context
> > :   evaluation context
> >
> > returns
> > :   any\[\]
> >
> > Returns a list description for the domain. Note that this method
> > takes an optional [context]{.title-ref} object that will be used to
> > replace all free variables.
> >
> > ``` javascript
> > new Domain(`[('a', '>', b)]`).toList({ b:3 }); // [['a', '>', 3]]
> > ```

The [Domain]{.title-ref} class also provides 4 useful static methods to
combine domains:

``` javascript
// ["&", ("a", "=", 1), ("uid", "<=", uid)]
Domain.and([[["a", "=", 1]], "[('uid', '<=', uid)]"]).toString();

// ["|", ("a", "=", 1), ("uid", "<=", uid)]
Domain.or([[["a", "=", 1]], "[('uid', '<=', uid)]"]).toString();

// ["!", ("a", "=", 1)]
Domain.not([["a", "=", 1]]).toString();

// ["&", ("a", "=", 1), ("uid", "<=", uid)]
Domain.combine([[["a", "=", 1]], "[('uid', '<=', uid)]"], "AND").toString();
```

## Bus {#frontend/framework/bus}

The web client
`environment <frontend/framework/environment>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} object contains an event bus, named [bus]{.title-ref}. Its
purpose is to allow various parts of the system to properly coordinate
themselves, without coupling them. The [env.bus]{.title-ref} is an owl
[EventBus](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/reference/event_bus.md),
that should be used for global events of interest.

``` javascript
// for example, in some service code:
env.bus.on("WEB_CLIENT_READY", null, doSomething);
```

Here is a list of the events that can be triggered on this bus:

  Message                       Payload                                                                                           Trigger
  ----------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `ACTION_MANAGER:UI-UPDATED`   a mode indicating what part of the ui has been updated (\'current\', \'new\' or \'fullscreen\')   the rendering of the action requested to the action manager is done
  `ACTION_MANAGER:UPDATE`       next rendering info                                                                               the action manager has finished computing the next interface
  `MENUS:APP-CHANGED`           none                                                                                              the menu service\'s current app has changed
  `ROUTE_CHANGE`                none                                                                                              the url hash was changed
  `RPC:REQUEST`                 rpc id                                                                                            a rpc request has just started
  `RPC:RESPONSE`                rpc id                                                                                            a rpc request is completed
  `WEB_CLIENT_READY`            none                                                                                              the web client has been mounted
  `FOCUS-VIEW`                  none                                                                                              the main view should focus itself
  `CLEAR-CACHES`                none                                                                                              all internal caches should be cleared
  `CLEAR-UNCOMMITTED-CHANGES`   list of functions                                                                                 all views with uncommitted changes should clear them, and push a callback in the list

## Browser Object

The javascript framework also provides a special object `browser` that
provides access to many browser APIs, like `location`, `localStorage` or
`setTimeout`. For example, here is how one could use the
`browser.setTimeout` function:

``` javascript
import { browser } from "@web/core/browser/browser";

// somewhere in code
browser.setTimeout(someFunction, 1000);
```

It is mostly interesting for testing purposes: all code using the
browser object can be tested easily by mocking the relevant functions
for the duration of the test.

It contains the following content:

  -------------------------------- ------------------------------------ -------------------------------------
  [addEventListener]{.title-ref}   [cancelAnimationFrame]{.title-ref}   [clearInterval]{.title-ref}
  [clearTimeout]{.title-ref}       [console]{.title-ref}                [Date]{.title-ref}
  [fetch]{.title-ref}              [history]{.title-ref}                [localStorage]{.title-ref}
  [location]{.title-ref}           [navigator]{.title-ref}              [open]{.title-ref}
  [random]{.title-ref}             [removeEventListener]{.title-ref}    [requestAnimationFrame]{.title-ref}
  [sessionStorage]{.title-ref}     [setInterval]{.title-ref}            [setTimeout]{.title-ref}
  [XMLHttpRequest]{.title-ref}                                          
  -------------------------------- ------------------------------------ -------------------------------------

## Debug mode {#frontend/framework/debug_mode}

Odoo can sometimes operate in a special mode called the
[debug]{.title-ref} mode. It is used for two main purposes:

- display additional information/fields for some particular screens,
- provide some additional tools to help developer debug the Odoo
  interface.

The [debug]{.title-ref} mode is described by a string. An empty string
means that the [debug]{.title-ref} mode is not active. Otherwise, it is
active. If the string contains [assets]{.title-ref} or
[tests]{.title-ref}, then the corresponding specific sub modes are
activated (see below). Both modes can be active at the same time, for
example with the string [assets,tests]{.title-ref}.

The [debug]{.title-ref} mode current value can be read in the
`environment<frontend/framework/environment>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}: [env.debug]{.title-ref}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To show menus, fields or view elements only in debug mode, you should
target the group \`base.group_no_one\`:

``` xml
<field name="fname" groups="base.group_no_one"/>
```
::::

::: seealso
\- `Activate the debug mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
:::

### Assets mode {#frontend/framework/assets_debug_mode}

The [debug=assets]{.title-ref} sub mode is useful to debug javascript
code: once activated, the `assets<reference/assets>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} bundles are no longer minified, and source-maps are
generated as well. This makes it useful to debug all kind of javascript
code.

### Tests mode {#frontend/framework/tests_debug_mode}

There is another sub mode named \`tests\`: if enabled, the server
injects the bundle [web.assets_tests]{.title-ref} in the page. This
bundle contains mostly test tours (tours whose purpose is to test a
feature, not to show something interesting to users). The
[tests]{.title-ref} mode is then useful to be able to run these tours.

# Hooks {#frontend/hooks}

[Owl
hooks](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/reference/hooks.md)
are a way to factorize code, even if it depends on some component
lifecycle. Most hooks provided by Owl are related to the lifecycle of a
component, but some of them (such as
[useComponent](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/reference/hooks.md#usecomponent))
provide a way to build specific hooks.

Using these hooks, it is possible to build many customized hooks that
help solve a specific problem, or make some common tasks easier. The
rest of this page documents the list of hooks provided by the Odoo web
framework.

    <div t-ref="popper">
      I am positioned through a wonderful hook!
    </div>
  `;

  setup() {
    // Here, the reference is the target props, which is an HTMLElement
    usePosition(this.props.target);
  }
}
```

:::: important

  Option                       Type                    Description
  ---------------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [popper]{.title-ref}         string                  this is a [useRef

                                                       for the element that will get positioned. Default is [\"popper\"]{.title-ref}.

  [container]{.title-ref}      HTMLElement             the container from which the popper is expected not to overflow. If overflowing
                                                       occurs, other popper positions are tried until a not overflowing one is found.
                                                       (default: the [\<html/\>]{.title-ref} node)

  [margin]{.title-ref}         number                  added margin between popper and reference elements (default: [0]{.title-ref})

  [position]{.title-ref}       Direction\[-Variant\]   the desired position. It is a string composed of one [Direction]{.title-ref} and
                                                       one [Variant]{.title-ref} separated by a dash character. [Direction]{.title-ref}
                                                       could be: [top]{.title-ref}, [bottom]{.title-ref}, [right]{.title-ref},

                                                       omitted (default variant is [middle]{.title-ref}). The [fit]{.title-ref} variant
                                                       means that the popper would have the exact same width or height, depending on the
                                                       chosen direction. Examples of valid positions: [right-end]{.title-ref},
                                                       [top-start]{.title-ref}, [left-middle]{.title-ref}, [left]{.title-ref},
                                                       [bottom-fit]{.title-ref}. (default position: [bottom]{.title-ref})

  [onPositioned]{.title-ref}   (el: HTMLElement,       a callback that will be called everytime a positioning occurs (e.g. on component

## useSpellCheck {#frontend/hooks/useSpellCheck}

### Location

[\@web/core/utils/hooks]{.title-ref}

### Description

Activate the spellcheck state to an input or textarea on focus by a
[t-ref=\"spellcheck\"]{.title-ref} in the current component. This state
is then removed on blur, as well as the red outline, which improves
readability of the content.

The hook can also be used on any HTML element with the
[contenteditable]{.title-ref} attribute. To disable spellcheck
completely on elements that might be enabled by the hook, set explicitly
the [spellcheck]{.title-ref} attribute as [false]{.title-ref} on the
element.

::: example
In the following example, the spellcheck will be enabled on the first
input, the textarea and the div with
[contenteditable=\"true\"]{.title-ref}.

``` javascript
import { useSpellCheck } from "@web/core/utils/hooks";

class Comp {
  setup() {
    this.simpleRef = useSpellCheck();
    this.customRef = useSpellCheck({ refName: "custom" });
    this.nodeRef = useSpellCheck({ refName: "container" });
  }
  static template = "Comp";
}
```

``` xml
<t t-name="Comp">
  <input t-ref="spellcheck" type="text"/>
  <textarea t-ref="custom"/>
  <div t-ref="container">
    <input type="text" spellcheck="false"/>
    <div contenteditable="true"/>
  </div>
</t>
```
:::

### API

> 
>
> param Options options
> :   the spellcheck options (see table below)

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Option                  Type           Description
  ----------------------- -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  [refName]{.title-ref}   string         this is a [useRef
                                         reference]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/hooks.md#useref)
                                         for the element that will be spellcheck enabled.

# Javascript Modules {#frontend/js_modules}

Odoo supports three different kinds of javascript files:

- `plain javascript files <frontend/modules/plain_js>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} (no module system),
- `native javascript module <frontend/modules/native_js>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- `Odoo modules <frontend/modules/odoo_module>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} (using a custom module system),

As described in the
`assets management page <reference/assets>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, all javascript files are bundled together and served to the
browser. Note that native javascript files are processed by the Odoo
server and transformed into Odoo custom modules.

Let us briefly explain the purpose behind each kind of javascript file.
Plain javascript files should be reserved only for external libraries
and some small specific low level purposes. All new javascript files
should be created in the native javascript module system. The custom
module system is only useful for old, not yet converted files.

## Plain Javascript files {#frontend/modules/plain_js}

Plain javascript files can contain arbitrary content. It is advised to
use the *iife*
`immediately invoked function execution`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}
style when writing such a file:

``` javascript
(function () {
  // some code here
  let a = 1;
  console.log(a);
})();
```

The advantages of such files is that we avoid leaking local variables to
the global scope.

Clearly, plain javascript files do not offer the benefits of a module
system, so one needs to be careful about the order in the bundle (since
the browser will execute them precisely in that order).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In Odoo, all external libraries are loaded as plain javascript files.
::::

## Native Javascript Modules {#frontend/modules/native_js}

Odoo javascript code uses the native javascript module system. This is
simpler, and brings the benefits of a better developer experience with a
better integration with the IDE.

Let us consider the following module, located in
`web/static/src/file_a.js`{.interpreted-text role="file"}:

``` javascript
import { someFunction } from "./file_b";

export function otherFunction(val) {
    return someFunction(val + 3);
}
```

There is a very important point to know: by default Odoo transpiles
files under [/static/src]{.title-ref} and [/static/tests]{.title-ref}
into `Odoo modules <frontend/modules/odoo_module>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. This file will then be transpiled into an Odoo module that
looks like this:

``` javascript
odoo.define('@web/file_a', ['@web/file_b'], function (require) {
'use strict';
let __exports = {};

const { someFunction } = require("@web/file_b");

__exports.otherFunction = function otherFunction(val) {
   return someFunction(val + 3);
};

return __exports;
)};
```

So, as you can see, the transformation is basically adding
[odoo.define]{.title-ref} on top and updating the import/export
statements. This is an opt-out system, it\'s possible to tell the
transpiler to ignore the file.

``` javascript
/** @odoo-module ignore **/
(function () {
  const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
  console.log(sum(1, 2));
)();
```

Note the comment in the first line: it describes that this file should
be ignored.

In other folders, files aren\'t transpiled by default, it is opt-in.
Odoo will look at the first line of a JS file and check if it contains a
comment with *\@odoo-module* and without the tag *ignore*. If so, it
will automatically be converted to an Odoo module.

``` javascript
/** @odoo-module **/
export function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Another important point is that the transpiled module has an official
name: *\@web/file_a*. This is the actual name of the module. Every
relative imports will be converted as well. Every file located in an
Odoo addon `some_addon/static/src/path/to/file.js`{.interpreted-text
role="file"} will be assigned a name prefixed by the addon name like
this: *\@some_addon/path/to/file*.

Relative imports work, but only if the modules are in the same Odoo
addon. So, imagine that we have the following file structure:

    addons/
        web/
            static/
                src/
                    file_a.js
                    file_b.js
        stock/
            static/
                src/
                    file_c.js

The file `file_b`{.interpreted-text role="file"} can import
`file_a`{.interpreted-text role="file"} like this:

``` javascript
import {something} from `./file_a`;
```

But `file_c`{.interpreted-text role="file"} need to use the full name:

``` javascript
import {something} from `@web/file_a`;
```

### Aliased modules

Because `Odoo modules <frontend/modules/odoo_module>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} follow a different module naming pattern, a system exists to
allow a smooth transition towards the new system. Currently, if a file
is converted to a module (and therefore follow the new naming
convention), other files not yet converted to ES6-like syntax in the
project won\'t be able to require the module. Aliases are here to map
old names with new ones by creating a small proxy function. The module
can then be called by its new *and* old name.

To add such alias, the comment tag on top of the file should look like
this:

``` javascript
/** @odoo-module alias=web.someName**/
import { someFunction } from './file_b';

export default function otherFunction(val) {
    return someFunction(val + 3);
}
```

Then, the translated module will also create an alias with the requested
name:

``` javascript
odoo.define(`web.someName`, ['@web/file_a'], function(require) {
    return require('@web/file_a')[Symbol.for("default")];
});
```

The default behaviour of aliases is to re-export the `default` value of
the module they alias. This is because \"classic\" modules generally
export a single value which would be used directly, roughly matching the
semantics of default exports. However it is also possible to delegate
more directly, and follow the exact behaviour of the aliased module:

``` javascript
/** @odoo-module alias=web.someName default=0**/
import { someFunction } from './file_b';

export function otherFunction(val) {
    return someFunction(val + 3);
}
```

In that case, this will define an alias with exactly the values exported
by the original module:

``` javascript
odoo.define(`web.someName`, ["@web/file_a"], function(require) {
    return require('@web/file_a');
});
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Only one alias can be defined using this method. If you were to need
another one to have, for example, three names to call the same module,
you would have to add a proxy manually. This is not good practice and
should be avoided unless there is no other options.
::::

### Limitations

For performance reasons, Odoo does not use a full javascript parser to
transform native modules. There are, therefore, a number of limitations
including but not limited to:

- an [import]{.title-ref} or [export]{.title-ref} keyword cannot be
  preceded by a non-space character,

- a multiline comment or string cannot have a line starting by
  [import]{.title-ref} or [export]{.title-ref}

  ``` javascript
  // supported
  import X from "xxx";
  export X;
    export default X;
      import X from "xxx";

  /*
   * import X ...
   */

  /*
   * export X
   */


  // not supported

  var a= 1;import X from "xxx";
  /*
    import X ...
  */
  ```

- when you export an object, it can\'t contain a comment

  ``` javascript
  // supported
  export {
    a as b,
    c,
    d,
  }

  export {
    a
  } from "./file_a"


  // not supported
  export {
    a as b, // this is a comment
    c,
    d,
  }

  export {
    a /* this is a comment */
  } from "./file_a"
  ```

- Odoo needs a way to determine if a module is described by a path (like
  `./views/form_view`{.interpreted-text role="file"}) or a name (like
  [web.FormView]{.title-ref}). It has to use a heuristic to do just
  that: if there is a [/]{.title-ref} in the name, it is considered a
  path. This means that Odoo does not really support module names with a
  [/]{.title-ref} anymore.

As \"classic\" modules are not deprecated and there is currently no plan
to remove them, you can and should keep using them if you encounter
issues with, or are constrained by the limitations of, native modules.
Both styles can coexist within the same Odoo addon.

## Odoo Module System {#frontend/modules/odoo_module}

Odoo has defined a small module system (located in the file
`addons/web/static/src/js/boot.js`{.interpreted-text role="file"}, which
needs to be loaded first). The Odoo module system, inspired by AMD,
works by defining the function [define]{.title-ref} on the global odoo
object. We then define each javascript module by calling that function.
In the Odoo framework, a module is a piece of code that will be executed
as soon as possible. It has a name and potentially some dependencies.
When its dependencies are loaded, a module will then be loaded as well.
The value of the module is then the return value of the function
defining the module.

As an example, it may look like this:

``` javascript
// in file a.js
odoo.define('module.A', [], function (require) {
    "use strict";

    var A = ...;

    return A;
});

// in file b.js
odoo.define('module.B', ['module.A'], function (require) {
    "use strict";

    var A = require('module.A');

    var B = ...; // something that involves A

    return B;
});
```

If some dependencies are missing/non ready, then the module will simply
not be loaded. There will be a warning in the console after a few
seconds.

Note that circular dependencies are not supported. It makes sense, but
it means that one needs to be careful.

### Defining a module

The [odoo.define]{.title-ref} method is given three arguments:

- \`moduleName\`: the name of the javascript module. It should be a
  unique string. The convention is to have the name of the odoo addon
  followed by a specific description. For example,
  [web.Widget]{.title-ref} describes a module defined in the
  [web]{.title-ref} addon, which exports a [Widget]{.title-ref} class
  (because the first letter is capitalized)

  If the name is not unique, an exception will be thrown and displayed
  in the console.

- \`dependencies\`: It should be a list of strings, each corresponding
  to a javascript module. This describes the dependencies that are
  required to be loaded before the module is executed.

- finally, the last argument is a function which defines the module. Its
  return value is the value of the module, which may be passed to other
  modules requiring it.

  ``` javascript
  odoo.define('module.Something', ['web.ajax'], function (require) {
      "use strict";

      var ajax = require('web.ajax');

      // some code here
      return something;
  });
  ```

If an error happens, it will be logged (in debug mode) in the console:

- \`Missing dependencies\`: These modules do not appear in the page. It
  is possible that the JavaScript file is not in the page or that the
  module name is wrong
- \`Failed modules\`: A javascript error is detected
- \`Rejected modules\`: The module returns a rejected Promise. It (and
  its dependent modules) is not loaded.
- \`Rejected linked modules\`: Modules who depend on a rejected module
- \`Non loaded modules\`: Modules who depend on a missing or a failed
  module

# Javascript Reference

This document presents the Odoo Javascript framework. This framework is
not a large application in term of lines of code, but it is quite
generic, because it is basically a machine to turn a declarative
interface description into a live application, able to interact with
every model and records in the database. It is even possible to use the
web client to modify the interface of the web client.

## Overview

The Javascript framework is designed to work with three main use cases:

- the *web client*: this is the private web application, where one can
  view and edit business data. This is a single page application (the
  page is never reloaded, only the new data is fetched from the server
  whenever it is needed)
- the *website*: this is the public part of Odoo. It allows an
  unidentified user to browse some content, to shop or to perform many
  actions, as a client. This is a classical website: various routes with
  controllers and some javascript to make it work.
- the *point of sale*: this is the interface for the point of sale. It
  is a specialized single page application.

Some javascript code is common to these three use cases, and is bundled
together (see below in the assets section). This document will focus
mostly on the architecture of the web client.

## Web client

### Single Page Application

The web client is a single-page application: instead of requesting a
full page from the server each time the user performs an action, it only
loads what is needed to update the user interface (UI) as a result of
that action. While doing this, it also takes care of updating
information in the URL, so that, in most cases, refreshing the page or
closing the browser and opening it again shows you the same thing.

### Overview of web client JS code

Here, we give a very quick overview of the web client code, in the
`web`{.interpreted-text role="file"} addon. The paths will be described
relative to `web/static/src`{.interpreted-text role="file"}. The
following description is deliberately not exhaustive; the goal is only
to give the reader a bird\'s eye view of the architecture.

- `module_loader.js`{.interpreted-text role="file"}: this is the file
  that defines the Odoo javascript module system. It needs to be loaded
  before any other JS module.
- `core/`{.interpreted-text role="file"}: this folder contains code that
  forms the lowest level of the javascript framework and that can be
  used in the web client as well as the website, portal, and point of
  sale application.
- `weblient/`{.interpreted-text role="file"}: this folder contains files
  that are specific to the web client and cannot be used in the website
  or point of sale, such as the action manager and the action service.
- `webclient/webclient.js`{.interpreted-text role="file"}: this is the
  webclient component proper. It is mostly a wrapper for the action
  container and the navbar, and does a few things that are required upon
  starting the application, such as loading the state of the url.
- `webclient/actions/`{.interpreted-text role="file"}: this folder
  contains the code responsible for displaying and switching between
  actions.
- `views/`{.interpreted-text role="file"}: this folder contains the code
  for the view infrastructure, as well as most of the views (some types
  of views are added by other addons).
- `views/fields/`{.interpreted-text role="file"}: contains the
  definition of the various field components, as well as some utilities
  used by multiple fields.
- `search/`{.interpreted-text role="file"} all these files define the
  search view (it is not a view in the point of view of the web client,
  only from the server point of view)

### What to do if a file is not loaded/updated

There are many different reasons why a file may not be properly loaded.
Here are a few things you can try to solve the issue:

- Make sure you saved your file; forgetting to do that happens to the
  best of us.
- Take a look at the console (in the dev tools, usually opened with F12)
  and check for errors.
- Try adding a [console.log()]{.title-ref} at the beginning of your file
  so you can see if a file has been loaded or not. If it is not loaded,
  if may not be in the proper assets bundle, or the asset bundle may not
  be up to date.
- Depending on your settings, the server may not regenerate the assets
  bundles after a file has been modified; there are a few options to
  solve this:
  - restarting the server will force it to check if the asset bundle is
    up to date the next time it is requested
  - in debug mode, there is an option in the debug menu
    (`fa-bug`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} button in the navbar) to
    force the server to regenerate the assets bundle on the fly without
    restarting.
  - starting the server with the [\--dev=xml]{.title-ref} option will
    force the server to check if an asset bundle is up to date every
    time it is requested. We advise you to use this option when actively
    developing, but not in production.
- Make sure you refresh your page after changing the code. Odoo
  currently does not have any hot module reloading mechanism.

## Loading Javascript Code

Large applications are usually broken up into smaller files, that need
to be connected together. Some file may need to use code defined in
another file. There are two ways of sharing code between files:

- using the global scope (the *window* object) to read/write references
  to some objects or functions,
- using a module system that will provide a way for each modules to
  export or import values, and will make sure that they are loaded in a
  proper order.

While it\'s possible to work in the global scope, this has a number of
issues:

- It is difficult to ensure that implementation details are not exposed:
  function declarations in the global scope are accessible to all other
  code.
- There is a single namespace, creating great potential for naming
  conflicts.
- Dependencies are implicit: if a piece of code depends on another, the
  order in which they are loaded is important, but difficult to
  guarantee.

Using a module system helps resolve these issues: because modules
specify their dependencies, the module system can load them in the
proper order or emit an error if dependencies are missing or circular.
Modules also form their own namespace, and can choose what to export,
preventing exposure of implementation detail and naming collisions.

While we could use ECMAScript (ES) modules directly, there are a number
of disadvantages to that approach: each ES module requires a network
round trip, which becomes very slow when you have hundreds of files, and
many files in Odoo need to be present despite not being imported by
anything because they simply add code that the framework will use
instead of the other way around.

Because of this, Odoo has a system of asset bundles. In these bundles,
JavaScript files are ES modules with a special annotation at the top.
These modules will be bundled together and transpiled to be usable by
our module loader. While you can write code that doesn\'t use this
module system, it is generally not recommended.

(see `frontend/modules/native_js`{.interpreted-text role="ref"})

### Patching classes

While we do our best to provide extension points that don\'t require it,
it is sometimes necessary to modify the behavior of an existing class
*in place*. The goal is to have a mechanism to change a class and all
future/present instances. This is done by using the [patch]{.title-ref}
utility function:

``` javascript
import { Hamster } from "@web/core/hamster"
import { patch } from "@web/core/utils/patch";

patch(Hamster.prototype, {
    sleep() {
        super.sleep(...arguments);
        console.log("zzzz");
    },
});
```

When patching methods, you need to patch the class\' prototype, but if
you would like to patch a static property of the class, you need to
patch the class itself.

Patching is a dangerous operation and should be done with care as it
will modify all instances of the class, even if they have already been
created. To avoid weird issues, patches should be applied as soon as
possible, at the top-level of your module. Patching classes at runtime
can result in extremely difficult to debug issues if the class has
already been instanciated.

## Registries

A common need in the Odoo ecosystem is to extend/change the behaviour of
the base system from the outside (by installing an application, i.e. a
different module). For example, one may need to add a new field widget
in some views. In that case, and many others, the usual process is to
create the desired component, then add it to a registry (registering
step), to make the rest of the web client aware of its existence.

There are a few registries available in the system. The registries that
are used by the framework are categories on the main registry, that can
be imported from `@web/core/registry`{.interpreted-text role="js:data"}

field registry

:   The field registry contains all field widgets known to the web
    client. Whenever a view (typically form or list/kanban) needs a
    field widget, this is where it will look. A typical use case look
    like this:

    ``` javascript
    import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";
    class PadField extends Component { ... }

    registry.category("fields").add("pad", {
      component: PadField,
      supportedTypes: ["char"],
      // ...
    });
    ```

view registry

:   This registry contains all JS views known to the web client.

action registry

:   We keep track of all client actions in this registry. This is where
    the action manager looks up whenever it needs to create a client
    action. Client actions can be a function - the function will be
    called when the action is invoked, and the returned value will be
    executed as a follow up action if needed - or an Owl component that
    will be displayed when executing that action.

## Services

Within the webclient, there are some concerns that cannot be handled by
a single component, as the concern is transversal, involves many
components, or needs to maintain some state for as long as the
application is alive.

Services are a solution to these problems: they are created during
application startup, are available to components through the hook
[useService]{.title-ref}, and stay alive for the entire lifetime of the
application.

For example, we have the *orm* service whose job is to allow interacting
with business objects on the server.

Here is a simplified example on how the orm service is implemented:

``` javascript
import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";
export const OrmService = {
    start() {
        return {
            read(...) { ... },
            write(...) { ... },
            unlink(...) { ... },
            ...
        }
    },
};
registry.category("services").add("orm", OrmService);
```

### Using services

Services are available in the environment, but should generally be used
through the [useService]{.title-ref} hook, which prevents calling
methods on the service after a component has been destroyed, and
prevents further code from executing after a method call if the
component was destroyed during the call.

``` javascript
class SomeComponent extends Component {
    setup() {
        this.orm = useService("orm");
    }
    // ...
    getActivityModelViewID(model) {
        return this.orm.call(model, "get_activity_view_id", this.params);
    }
}
```

### Talking to the server

There are typically two use cases when working on Odoo: one may need to
call a method on a (python) model (this goes through the controller
[/web/dataset/call_kw]{.title-ref}), or one may need to directly call a
controller (available on some route).

- Calling a method on a python model is done through the orm service:

  ``` javascript
  return this.orm.call("some.model", "some_method", [some, args]);
  ```

- Directly calling a controller is done through the rpc service:

  ``` javascript
  return this.rpc("/some/route/", {
      some: param,
  });
  ```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The rpc service doesn\'t really perform what is generally understood as
a remote procedure call (RPC), but for historical reasons, within Odoo
we generally call any network request performed in JavaScript an RPC. As
highlighted in the previous paragraph, if you want to call a method on a
model, you should use the orm service.
::::

## Notifications

The Odoo framework has a standard way to communicate various information
to the user: notifications, which are displayed on the top right of the
user interface. The types of notification follow the bootstrap toasts:

- *info*: useful to display some informational feedback as a consequence
  of an action that cannot fail.
- *success*: the user performed an action that can sometimes fail but
  didn\'t.
- *warning*: the user performed an action that could only be partially
  completed. Also useful if something is wrong but wasn\'t caused by the
  user directly, or is not particularly actionable.
- *success*: the user tried to performed an action but it couldn\'t be
  completed.

Notifications can also be used to ask a question to the user without
disturbing their workflow: e.g. a phone call received through VOIP: a
sticky notification could be displayed with two buttons to *Accept* or
*Decline*.

### Displaying notifications

There are two ways to display notifications in Odoo:

- The *notification* service allows component to display notifications
  from JS code by calling the add method.
- The *display_notification* client action allows to trigger the display
  of a notification from python (e.g. in the method called when the user
  clicked on a button of type object). This client action uses the
  notification service.

Notifications have a few *options*:

- *title*: string, optional. This will be displayed on the top as a
  title.
- *message*: string, optional. The content of the notification. Can be a
  markup object to display formatted text.
- *sticky*: boolean, optional (default false). If true, the notification
  will stay until the user dismisses it. Otherwise, the notification
  will be automatically closed after a short delay.
- *type*: string, optional (default \"warning\"). Determines the style
  of the notification. Possible values: \"info\", \"success\",
  \"warning\", \"danger\"
- *className*: string, optional. This is a css class name that will be
  automatically added to the notification. This could be useful for
  styling purpose, even though its use is discouraged.

Here are some examples on how to display notifications in JS:

``` javascript
// note that we call _t on the text to make sure it is properly translated.
this.notification.add({
    title: _t("Success"),
    message: _t("Your signature request has been sent.")
});
this.notification.add({
    title: _t("Error"),
    message: _t("Filter name is required."),
    type: "danger",
});
```

And in Python:

``` python
# note that we call _(string) on the text to make sure it is properly translated.
def show_notification(self):
    return {
        'type': 'ir.actions.client',
        'tag': 'display_notification',
        'params': {
            'title': _('Success'),
            'message': _('Your signature request has been sent.'),
            'sticky': False,
        }
    }
```

## Systray

The Systray is the right part of the navbar in the interface, where the
web client displays a few widgets, such as the messaging menu.

When the systray is created by the navbar, it will look for all
registered systray items and display them.

There is currently no specific API for systray items. They are Owl
components, and can communicate with their environment just like other
components, e.g. by interacting with services.

### Adding a new Systray Item

Items can be added to the systray by adding them to the \"systray\"
registry:

``` javascript
import { registry } from "@web/core/registry"
class MySystrayComponent extends Component {
    ...
}
registry.category("systray").add("MySystrayComponent", MySystrayComponent, { sequence: 1 });
```

The items are ordered in the systray according to their sequence in the
systray registry.

## Translation management

Some translations are made on the server side (basically all text
strings rendered or processed by the server), but there are strings in
the static files that need to be translated. The way it currently works
is the following:

- each translatable string is tagged with the special function *\_t*
- these strings are used by the server to generate the proper PO files
- whenever the web client is loaded, it will call the route
  */web/webclient/translations*, which returns a list of all
  translatable terms
- at runtime, whenever the function [\_t]{.title-ref} is called, it will
  look up in this list in order to find a translation, and return it or
  the original string if none is found.

Note that translations are explained in more details, from the server
point of view, in the document
`/developer/howtos/translations`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

``` javascript
import { _t } from "@web/core/l10n/translation";

class SomeComponent extends Component {
    static exampleString = _t("this should be translated");
    ...
    someMethod() {
        const str = _t("some text");
    }
}
```

Note that using the translation function requires some care: the string
given as an argument cannot be dynamic, as it is extracted statically
from the code to generate the PO files and serves as the identifier for
the term to translate. If you need to inject some dynamic content in the
string, [\_t]{.title-ref} supports placeholders:

``` javascript
import { _t } from "@web/core/l10n/translation";
const str = _t("Hello %s, you have %s unread messages.", user.name, unreadCount);
```

Notice how the string itself is fixed. This allows the translation
function to retrieve the translated string *before* using it for
interpolation.

## Session

The webclient needs some information from the python to function
properly. To avoid an extra round-trip with the server by making a
network request in JavaScript, this information is serialized directly
in the page, and can be accessed in JS through the
[\@web/session]{.title-ref} module.

### Adding information to the session

When the [/web]{.title-ref} route is loaded, the server injects this
information in a script tag. The information is obtained by calling the
method [session_info]{.title-ref} of the model [ir.http]{.title-ref}.
You can override this method to add information to the returned
dictionary.

``` python
from odoo import models
from odoo.http import request

class IrHttp(models.AbstractModel):
    _inherit = ['ir.http']

    def session_info(self):
        result = super(IrHttp, self).session_info()
        result['some_key'] = get_some_value_from_db()
        return result
```

Now, the value can be obtained in javascript by reading it in the
session:

``` javascript
import { session } from "@web/session"
const myValue = session.some_key;
...
```

Note that this mechanism is designed to reduce the amount of
communication needed by the web client to be ready. It is only
appropriate for data which is cheap to compute (a slow session_info call
will delay the loading for the web client for everyone), and for data
which is required early in the initialization process.

## Views

The word \"view\" has more than one meaning. This section is about the
design of the javascript code of the views, not the structure of the
*arch* or anything else.

While views are just owl components, the built-in views generally have
the same structure: a component called \"SomethingController\" which is
the root of the view. This component creates an instance of some
\"model\" (an object responsible for managing the data), and has a
subcomponent called a \"renderer\" that handles the display logic.

## Fields {#reference/js/widgets}

A good part of the web client experience is about editing and creating
data. Most of that work is done with the help of field widgets, which
are aware of the field type and of the specific details on how a value
should be displayed and edited.

### Decorations {#reference/javascript_reference/field_decoration}

Like the list view, field widgets have a simple support for decorations.
The goal of decorations is to have a simple way to specify a text color
depending on the record current state. For example:

``` xml
<field name="state" decoration-danger="amount &lt; 10000"/>
```

The valid decoration names are:

- [decoration-bf]{.title-ref}
- [decoration-it]{.title-ref}
- [decoration-danger]{.title-ref}
- [decoration-info]{.title-ref}
- [decoration-muted]{.title-ref}
- [decoration-primary]{.title-ref}
- [decoration-success]{.title-ref}
- [decoration-warning]{.title-ref}

Each decoration *decoration-X* will be mapped to a css class *text-X*,
which is a standard bootstrap css class (except for *text-it* and
*text-bf*, which are handled by odoo and correspond to italic and bold,
respectively). Note that the value of the decoration attribute should be
a valid python expression, which will be evaluated with the record as
evaluation context.

### Non-relational fields

We document here all non relational fields available by default, in no
particular order.

Integer ([integer]{.title-ref})

:   This is the default field type for fields of type
    [integer]{.title-ref}.

    - Supported field types: [integer]{.title-ref}

    Options:

    - \`type\`: setting the input type ([\"text\"]{.title-ref} by
      default, can be set on [\"number\"]{.title-ref})

      > In edit mode, the field is rendered as an input with the HTML
      > attribute type set on [\"number\"]{.title-ref} (so user can
      > benefit the native support, especially on mobile). In this case,
      > the default formatting is disabled to avoid incompability.

      > ``` xml
      > <field name="int_value" options="{'hide_trailing_zeros': true}" />
      > ```

Time ([float_time]{.title-ref})

:   The goal of this widget is to display properly a float value that
    represents a time interval (in hours). So, for example,
    [0.5]{.title-ref} should be formatted as [0:30]{.title-ref}, or
    [4.75]{.title-ref} correspond to [4:45]{.title-ref}.

    - Supported field types: [float]{.title-ref}

Float Factor ([float_factor]{.title-ref})

:   This widget aims to display properly a float value that converted
    using a factor given in its options. So, for example, the value
    saved in database is [0.5]{.title-ref} and the factor is
    [3]{.title-ref}, the widget value should be formatted as
    [1.5]{.title-ref}.

    - Supported field types: [float]{.title-ref}

Float Toggle ([float_toggle]{.title-ref})

:   The goal of this widget is to replace the input field by a button
    containing a range of possible values (given in the options). Each
    click allows the user to loop in the range. The purpose here is to
    restrict the field value to a predefined selection. Also, the widget
    support the factor conversion as the [float_factor]{.title-ref}
    widget (Range values should be the result of the conversion).

    - Supported field types: [float]{.title-ref}

    ``` xml
    <field name="days_to_close" widget="float_toggle" options="{'factor': 2, 'range': [0, 4, 8]}" />

      are SQL-formatted dates ([yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss]{.title-ref}) or
      [\"today\"]{.title-ref}.

      > ``` xml
      > <field name="datefield" options="{'min_date': 'today', 'max_date': '2023-12-31'}" />
      > ```

    Options:

    - see
      `Date Field <reference/javascript_reference/date_field>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} options

      > ``` xml
      > <field name="datetimefield" options="{'rounding': 10}" />
      > ```

    - \`show_seconds\`: when set to true, it shows the seconds from the
      datetime field. The field will still accept datetime values, but
      the seconds will be shown in the UI (default:

      > ``` xml
      > <field name="datetimefield" widget="datetime" options="{'show_seconds': true}" />
      > ```

    - \`show_time\`: when set to false, it hides the time part from the
      datetime field. The field will still accept datetime values, but

      > ```

    - \`show_date\`: when set to false, it hides the date part from the
      datetime field. The field will still accept datetime values, but
      the date part will be hidden in the UI (default:
      [true]{.title-ref}).

      > ``` xml
      > <field name="datetimefield" widget="datetime" options="{'show_date': false}" />
      > ```

    displays the delta (in days) between the value of the field and
    today. The widget turns into a regular date or datetime field in
    edit mode.

    - Supported field types: [date]{.title-ref}, [datetime]{.title-ref}

Monetary ([monetary]{.title-ref})

:   This is the default field type for fields of type
    [monetary]{.title-ref}. It is used to display a currency. If there
    is a currency fields given in option, it will use that, otherwise it
    will fall back to the default currency (in the session)

    - Supported field types: [monetary]{.title-ref}, [float]{.title-ref}

    Options:

    - \`currency_field\`: another field name which should be a many2one
      on currency.

    :::: warning
    ::: title
    Warning
    :::

    Having more than one field with a handle widget on the same list is
    not supported.
    ::::

    - Supported field types: [integer]{.title-ref}

Email ([email]{.title-ref})

:   This field displays email address. The main reason to use it is that
    it is rendered as an anchor tag with the proper href, in readonly
    mode.

    - Supported field types: [char]{.title-ref}

Phone ([phone]{.title-ref})

:   This field displays a phone number. The main reason to use it is
    that it is rendered as an anchor tag with the proper href, in
    readonly mode, but only in some cases: we only want to make it
    clickable if the device can call this particular number.

    - Supported field types: [char]{.title-ref}

URL ([url]{.title-ref})

:   This field displays an url (in readonly mode). The main reason to
    use it is that it is rendered as an anchor tag with the proper css
    classes and href.

    Also, the text of the anchor tag can be customized with the *text*
    attribute (it won\'t change the href value).

    - Supported field types: [char]{.title-ref}

    ``` xml
    <field name="foo" widget="url" text="Some URL" />
    ```

    Options:

    - \`website_path\`: (default: [false]{.title-ref}) by default, the
      widget forces (if not already the case) the href value to begin
      with [\"http://\"]{.title-ref} except if this option is set to
      [true]{.title-ref}, thus allowing redirections to the database\'s
      own website.

Domain ([domain]{.title-ref})

:   The [domain]{.title-ref} field allows the user to construct a
    technical-prefix domain thanks to a tree-like interface and see the
    selected records in real time. In debug mode, an input is also there
    to be able to enter the prefix char domain directly (or to build
    advanced domains the tree-like interface does not allow to).

    Note that this is limited to **static** domains (no dynamic
    expressions, or access to context variable).

    - Supported field types: [char]{.title-ref}

    Options:

    - \`model\`: the name of the char field encoding the
      [res_model]{.title-ref} on which the domain applies.
    - [foldable]{.title-ref} (default: [false]{.title-ref}): if true,
      the domain field is rendered compactly and unfolds itself upon
      user interaction.
    - [in_dialog]{.title-ref} (default: [false]{.title-ref}): if true,
      the widget opens a dialog when the user wants to edit the domain
      whereas by default, the domain editor is rendered just below the
      value.
    - [count_limit]{.title-ref} (default: [10000]{.title-ref}): the
      domain widget performs search_count requests to validate the
      domain, and to indicate the number of records matching it. This
      requests might be costly on large tables, so by default, the
      search_count is limited to 10000.

Link button ([link_button]{.title-ref})

:   The [LinkButton]{.title-ref} widget actually simply displays a span
    with an icon and the text value as content. The link is clickable
    and will open a new browser window with its value as url.

    - Supported field types: [char]{.title-ref}

Image File ([image]{.title-ref})

:   This widget is used to represent a binary value as an image. In some
    cases, the server returns a [bin_size]{.title-ref} instead of the
    real image (a [bin_size]{.title-ref} is a string representing a file
    size, such as [\"6.5kb\"]{.title-ref}). In that case, the widget
    will make an image with a source attribute corresponding to an image
    on the server.

    - Supported field types: [binary]{.title-ref}

    Options:

    - \`preview_image\`: if the image is only loaded as a
      [bin_size]{.title-ref}, then this option is useful to inform the
      web client that the default field name is not the name of the
      current field, but the name of another field.

      > ``` xml
      > <field name="image" widget="image" options="{'preview_image': 'image_128'}" />
      > ```

    - \`accepted_file_extensions\`: the file extension the user can pick
      from the file input dialog box (default value is
      [\"image/\*\"]{.title-ref})

      > (cf: `accept` attribute on [\<input type=\"file\"
      > /\>]{.title-ref})

Binary File ([binary]{.title-ref})

:   Generic widget to allow saving/downloading a binary file.

    - Supported field types: [binary]{.title-ref}

    Attributes:

    - \`filename\`: saving a binary file will lose its file name, since
      it only saves the binary value. The file name can be saved in
      another field. To do that, a [filename]{.title-ref} attribute
      should be set to a field present in the view.

      > ``` xml
      > <field name="datas" filename="datas_fname" />
      > ```

    Options:

    - \`accepted_file_extensions\`: the file extension the user can pick
      from the file input dialog box

      > (cf: `accept` attribute on [\<input type=\"file\"
      > /\>]{.title-ref})

Priority ([priority]{.title-ref})

:   This widget is rendered as a set of stars, allowing the user to
    click on it to select a value or not. This is useful for example to
    mark a task as high priority.

    Note that this widget also works in [readonly]{.title-ref} mode,
    which is unusual.

    - Supported field types: [selection]{.title-ref}

Image Attachment ([attachment_image]{.title-ref})

:   Image widget for [many2one]{.title-ref} fields. If the field is set,
    this widget will be rendered as an image with the proper src url.
    This widget does not have a different behaviour in edit or readonly
    mode, it is only useful to view an image.

    - Supported field types: [many2one]{.title-ref}

    ``` xml
    <field name="displayed_image_id" widget="attachment_image" />
    ```

Label Selection ([label_selection]{.title-ref})

:   This widget renders a simple non-editable label. This is only useful
    to display some information, not to edit it.

    - Supported field types: [selection]{.title-ref}

    Options:

    - \`classes\`: a mapping from a selection value to a CSS class name

      > ``` xml
      > <field
      >     name="state"
      >     widget="label_selection"
      >     options="{
      >         'classes': {
      >             'draft': 'default',
      >             'cancel': 'default',
      >             'none': 'danger',
      >         },
      >     }"
      > />
      > ```

State Selection ([state_selection]{.title-ref})

:   This is a specialized selection widget. It assumes that the record
    has some hardcoded fields, present in the view:
    [stage_id]{.title-ref}, [legend_normal]{.title-ref},
    [legend_blocked]{.title-ref}, [legend_done]{.title-ref}. This is
    mostly used to display and change the state of a task in a project,
    with additional information displayed in the dropdown.

    default the label next to the icon.

    - Supported field types: [selection]{.title-ref}

    Options:

    - \`hide_label\`: hide the label next to the icon

      > ``` xml
      > <field name="kanban_state" widget="state_selection" options="{'hide_label': true}" />
      > ```

      >         options="{'label_field': 'label_tasks'}"
      >     />
      > </button>
      > ```

Percent Pie ([percentpie]{.title-ref})

:   This widget is meant to represent statistical information in a [stat
    button]{.title-ref}. This is similar to a statinfo widget, but the
    information is represented in a **pie chart** (empty to full). Note
    that the value is interpreted as a percentage (a number between
    [0]{.title-ref} and [100]{.title-ref}).

    - Supported field types: [integer]{.title-ref}, [float]{.title-ref}

## Client actions

A client action is a component that can be displayed as the main element
in the webclient, occupying all the space below the navbar, just like an
[act_window_action]{.title-ref}. This is useful when you need a
component that is not closely linked to an existing view or a specific
model. For example, the Discuss application is a client action.

A client action is a term that has various meanings, depending on the
context:

- from the perspective of the server, it is a record of the model
  *ir_action*, with a field *tag* of type char
- from the perspective of the web client, it is an Owl component
  registered in the action registry under the same key its tag

Whenever a menu item is associated with a client action, opening it will
simply fetch the action definition from the server, then lookup its tag
in the action registry to get the component definition. This component
will then be rendered by the action container.

### Adding a client action

A client action is a component that will control the part of the screen
below the navbar. Defining a client action is as simple as creating an
Owl component and adding it to the action registry.

``` javascript
import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";
class MyClientAction extends Component { ... }
registry.category("actions").add("my-custom-action", ClientAction);
```

Then, to use the client action in the web client, we need to create a
client action record (a record of the model `ir.actions.client`) with
the proper `tag` attribute:

``` xml
<record id="my_client_action" model="ir.actions.client">
    <field name="name">Some Name</field>
    <field name="tag">my-custom-action</field>
</record>
```

# Mobile JavaScript {#reference/mobile}

## Introduction

In Odoo 10.0 we released a mobile app which allows you to access all
**Odoo apps** (even your customized modules).

The application is a combination of **Odoo Web** and **Native Mobile
components**. In other words it is a Odoo Web instance loaded inside a
native, mobile, WebView container.

This page documents how you can access mobile native components like
Camera, Vibration, Notification and Toast through Odoo Web (via
JavaScript). For this, you do not need to be a mobile developer, if you
know Odoo JavaScript API you can access all available mobile features.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

These features work with **Odoo Enterprise 10.0+** only
::::

## How does it work?

Internal workings of the mobile application:

![image](mobile/mobile_working.jpg)

Of course, it is a web page that loads on a Mobile Native Web container.
But it is integrated in such a way that you can access native resources
from your web JavaScript.

WebPages (Odoo Web) is on the top of each layer, where the second layer
is a Bridge between Odoo Web (JS) and the native mobile components.

When any call from JavaScript is triggered it passes through Bridge and
Bridge passes it to the native invoker to perform that action.

When the native component has done its work, it is passed to the Bridge
again and you get the output in JavaScript.

Process time taken by the Native component depends on what you are
requesting from the Native resources. For example the Camera or GPS
Location.

## How to use it?

Just like the Odoo Web Framework, the Mobile API can be used anywhere by
getting the object from **web_mobile.rpc**

![image](mobile/odoo_mobile_api.png)

The mobile RPC object provides a list of methods that are available
(this only works with the mobile app).

Check if the method is available and then execute it.

### Methods

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Each of the methods returns a JQuery Deferred object which returns a
data JSON dictionary
::::

#### Show Toast in device

> 
>
> param object args
> :   **message** text to display

A toast provides simple feedback about an operation in a small popup. It
only fills the amount of space required for the message and the current
activity remains visible and interactive.

``` javascript
mobile.methods.showToast({'message': 'Message sent'});
```

![image](mobile/toast.png)

#### Vibrating device

> 
>
> param object args
> :   Vibrates constantly for the specified period of time (in
>     milliseconds).

Vibrate mobile device with given duration.

``` javascript
mobile.methods.vibrate({'duration': 100});
```

#### Show snackbar with action

> 
>
> param object args
> :   (*required*) **Message** to show in snackbar and action **button
>     label** in Snackbar (optional)
>
> returns
> :   `True` if the user clicks on the Action button, `False` if
>     SnackBar auto dismissed after some time.

Snackbars provide lightweight feedback about an operation. They show a
brief message at the bottom of the screen on mobile or in the lower left
corner on larger devices. Snackbars appear above all the other elements
on the screen and only one can be displayed at a time.

``` javascript
mobile.methods.showSnackBar({'message': 'Message is deleted', 'btn_text': 'Undo'}).then(function(result){
    if(result){
        // Do undo operation
    }else{
        // Snack Bar dismissed
    }
});
```

![image](mobile/snackbar.png)

#### Showing notification

> 
>
> param object args
> :   **title** (first row) of the notification, **message** (second
>     row) of the notification, in a standard notification.

A notification is a message you can display to the user outside of your
application\'s normal UI. When you tell the system to issue a
notification, it first appears as an icon in the notification area. To
see the details of the notification, the user opens the notification
drawer. Both the notification area and the notification drawer are
system-controlled areas that the user can view at any time.

``` javascript
mobile.showNotification({'title': 'Simple Notification', 'message': 'This is a test for a simple notification'})
```

![image](mobile/mobile_notification.png)

#### Create contact in device

> 
>
> param object args
> :   Dictionary with contact details. Possible keys (name, mobile,
>     phone, fax, email, website, street, street2, country_id, state_id,
>     city, zip, parent_id, function and image)

Create a new device contact with the given contact details.

``` javascript
var contact = {
    'name': 'Michel Fletcher',
    'mobile': '9999999999',
    'phone': '7954856587',
    'fax': '765898745',
    'email': 'michel.fletcher@agrolait.example.com',
    'website': 'http://www.agrolait.com',
    'street': '69 rue de Namur',
    'street2': false,
    'country_id': [21, 'Belgium'],
    'state_id': false,
    'city': 'Wavre',
    'zip': '1300',
    'parent_id': [8, 'Agrolait'],
    'function': 'Analyst',
    'image': '<<BASE 64 Image Data>>'
}

mobile.methods.addContact(contact);
```

![image](mobile/mobile_contact_create.png)

#### Scanning barcodes

> 
>
> returns
> :   Scanned `code` from any barcode

The barcode API detects barcodes in real-time, on the device, in any
orientation.

The barcode API can read the following barcode formats:

- 1D barcodes: EAN-13, EAN-8, UPC-A, UPC-E, Code-39, Code-93, Code-128,
  ITF, Codabar
- 2D barcodes: QR Code, Data Matrix, PDF-417, AZTEC

``` javascript
mobile.methods.scanBarcode().then(function(code){
    if(code){
        // Perform operation with the scanned code
    }
});
```

#### Switching account in device

Use switchAccount to switch from one account to another on the device.

``` javascript
mobile.methods.switchAccount();
```

# Odoo Editor

Odoo Editor is Odoo\'s own rich text editor. Its sources can be found in
the [odoo-editor
directory]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web_editor/static/src/js/editor/odoo-editor).

## Powerbox

The Powerbox is a piece of user interface that contains
`commands <reference/frontend/odoo_editor/powerbox/command>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} organized into
`categories <reference/frontend/odoo_editor/powerbox/category>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. It appears when typing [/]{.title-ref} in the editor. The
commands can be filtered when the user inputs text, and navigated with
the arrow keys.

![The Powerbox opened after typing \"/\".](odoo_editor/powerbox.png){.align-center}

### Modifying the Powerbox

Only one Powerbox should be instantiated at the time, and that job is
done by the editor itself. Its Powerbox instance can be found in its
[powerbox]{.title-ref} instance variable. To change the Powerbox\'s
contents and options, change the options passed to the editor before it
gets instantiated.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Never instantiate the Powerbox yourself. Always use the current
editor\'s own instance instead.
::::

::::::: example
Say we want to add a new command [Document]{.title-ref} to the Powerbox,
just for the [mass_mailing]{.title-ref} module. We want to add it to a
new category called [Documentation]{.title-ref} and we want it all the
way at the top of the Powerbox.

[mass_mailing]{.title-ref}
[extends]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/mass_mailing/static/src/js/wysiwyg.js)
[web_editor]{.title-ref}\'s [Wysiwyg
class]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web_editor/static/src/js/wysiwyg/wysiwyg.js),
which instantiates the editor in its [start]{.title-ref} method. Before
doing so, it calls its own [\_getPowerboxOptions]{.title-ref} method,
which can conveniently be overridden to add our new commands.

Since [mass_mailing]{.title-ref} already overrides
[\_getPowerboxOptions]{.title-ref}, let\'s just add our new command to
it:

``` javascript
_getPowerboxOptions: function () {
    const options = this._super();
    // (existing code before the return statement)
    options.categories.push({
        name: _t('Documentation'),
        priority: 300,
    });
    options.commands.push({
        name: _t('Document'),
        category: _t('Documentation'),
        description: _t("Add this text to your mailing's documentation"),
        fontawesome: 'fa-book',
        priority: 1, // This is the only command in its category anyway.
    });
    return options;
}
```

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

In order to allow the names and descriptions of your commands and
categories to be translated, make sure to wrap them in the
[\_t]{.title-ref} function.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To avoid out-of-control escalations, don\'t use random numbers for your
priorities: look at which other priorities already exist and choose your
value accordingly (like you would do for a [z-index]{.title-ref}).
::::
:::::::

### Opening a custom Powerbox

It is possible to open the Powerbox with a custom set of categories and
commands, bypassing all pre-existing ones. To do that, call the
[open]{.title-ref} method of the Powerbox and pass it your custom
commands and categories.

![The Powerbox opened with custom categories and commands when pasting an
image URL.](odoo_editor/powerbox-custom.png){.align-center}

::: example
We need the current instance of the Powerbox, which can be found in the
current editor. In the [Wysiwyg
class]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web_editor/static/src/js/wysiwyg/wysiwyg.js),
you will find it as [this.odooEditor.powerbox]{.title-ref}.

Now to open it with our custom \"Document\" command in a custom
\"Documentation\" category:

``` javascript
this.odooEditor.powerbox.open(
    [{
        name: _t('Document'),
        category: _t('Documentation'),
        description: _t("Add this text to your mailing's documentation"),
        fontawesome: 'fa-book',
        priority: 1, // This is the only command in its category anyway.
    }],
    [{
        name: _t('Documentation'),
        priority: 300,
    }]
);
```
:::

### Filtering commands

There are three ways to filter commands:

1.  Via the [powerboxFilters]{.title-ref}
    `Powerbox option <reference/frontend/odoo_editor/powerbox/options>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
2.  Via a given
    `command <reference/frontend/odoo_editor/powerbox/command>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}\'s [isDisabled]{.title-ref} entry.
3.  The user can filter commands by simply typing text after opening the
    Powerbox. It will fuzzy-match that text with the names of the
    categories and commands.

![The Powerbox with its commands filtered using the word \"head\".](odoo_editor/powerbox-filtered.png){.align-center}

# Owl components {#frontend/components}

The Odoo Javascript framework uses a custom component framework called
Owl. It is a declarative component system, loosely inspired by Vue and
React. Components are defined using
`QWeb templates <qweb>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, enriched with
some Owl specific directives. The official [Owl
documentation](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/readme.md)
contains a complete reference and a tutorial.

:::: important

Although the code can be found in the [web]{.title-ref} module, it is
maintained from a separate GitHub repository. Any modification to Owl
should therefore be made through a pull request on
<https://github.com/odoo/owl>.
::::

Currently, all Odoo versions (starting in version 14) share the same Owl
version.
::::

## Using Owl components

The [Owl
documentation](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/readme.md)
already documents in detail the Owl framework, so this page will only
provide Odoo specific information. But first, let us see how we can make
a simple component in Odoo.

``` javascript
import { Component, xml, useState } from "@odoo/owl";

class MyComponent extends Component {
    static template = xml`
        <div t-on-click="increment">
            <t t-esc="state.value">
        </div>
    `;

    setup() {
        this.state = useState({ value: 1 });
    }

    increment() {
        this.state.value++;
    }
}
```

This example shows that Owl is available as a library in the global
namespace as \`owl\`: it can simply be used like most libraries in Odoo.
Note that we defined here the template as a static property, but without
using the [static]{.title-ref} keyword, which is not available in some
browsers (Odoo javascript code should be Ecmascript 2019 compliant).

We define here the template in the javascript code, with the help of the
[xml]{.title-ref} helper. However, it is only useful to get started. In
practice, templates in Odoo should be defined in an xml file, so they
can be translated. In that case, the component should only define the
template name.

In practice, most components should define 2 or 3 files, located at the
same place: a javascript file ([my_component.js]{.title-ref}), a
template file ([my_component.xml]{.title-ref}) and optionally a scss (or
css) file ([my_component.scss]{.title-ref}). These files should then be
added to some assets bundle. The web framework will take care of loading
the javascript/css files, and loading the templates into Owl.

Here is how the component above should be defined:

``` javascript
import { Component, useState } from "@odoo/owl";

class MyComponent extends Component {
    static template = 'myaddon.MyComponent';

    ...
}
```

And the template is now located in the corresponding xml file:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<templates xml:space="preserve">

<t t-name="myaddon.MyComponent">
  <div t-on-click="increment">
    <t t-esc="state.value"/>
  </div>
</t>

</templates>
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Template names should follow the convention
[addon_name.ComponentName]{.title-ref}.
::::

::: seealso
\- [Owl Repository](https://github.com/odoo/owl)
:::

## Best practices {#frontend/owl/best_practices}

First of all, components are classes, so they have a constructor. But
constructors are special methods in javascript that are not overridable
in any way. Since this is an occasionally useful pattern in Odoo, we
need to make sure that no component in Odoo directly uses the
constructor method. Instead, components should use the
[setup]{.title-ref} method:

``` javascript
// correct:
class MyComponent extends Component {
    setup() {
        // initialize component here
    }
}

// incorrect. Do not do that!
class IncorrectComponent extends Component {
    constructor(parent, props) {
        // initialize component here
    }
}
```

Another good practice is to use a consistent convention for template
names: [addon_name.ComponentName]{.title-ref}. This prevents name
collision between odoo addons.

## Reference List

The Odoo web client is built with [Owl](https://github.com/odoo/owl)
components. To make it easier, the Odoo javascript framework provides a
suite of generic components that can be reused in some common
situations, such as dropdowns, checkboxes or datepickers. This page
explains how to use these generic components.

### ActionSwiper {#frontend/owl/actionswiper}

#### Location

[\@web/core/action_swiper/action_swiper]{.title-ref}

#### Description

This is a component that can perform actions when an element is swiped
horizontally. The swiper is wrapping a target element to add actions to
it. The action is executed once the user has released the swiper passed
a portion of its width.

``` xml
<ActionSwiper onLeftSwipe="Object" onRightSwipe="Object">
  <SomeElement/>
</ActionSwiper>
```

The simplest way to use the component is to use it around your target
element directly in an xml template as shown above. But sometimes, you
may want to extend an existing element and would not want to duplicate
the template. It is possible to do just that.

If you want to extend the behavior of an existing element, you must
place the element inside, by wrapping it directly. Also, you can
conditionnally add props to manage when the element might be swipable,
its animation and the minimum portion to swipe to perform the action.

You can use the component to interact easily with records, messages,
items in lists and much more.

![Example of ActionSwiper usage](owl_components/actionswiper.png){.align-center
width="400px"}

The following example creates a basic ActionSwiper component. Here, the
swipe is enabled in both directions.

``` xml
<ActionSwiper
  onRightSwipe="
    {
      action: '() => Delete item',
      icon: 'fa-delete',
      bgColor: 'bg-danger',
    }"
  onLeftSwipe="
    {
      action: '() => Star item',
      icon: 'fa-star',
      bgColor: 'bg-warning',
    }"
>
  <div>
    Swipable item
  </div>
</ActionSwiper>
```

  Name                               Type                    Description
  ---------------------------------- ----------------------- ------------------------------------------
  [animationOnMove]{.title-ref}      [Boolean]{.title-ref}   optional boolean to determine if a
                                                             translate effect is present during the
                                                             swipe

  [animationType]{.title-ref}        [String]{.title-ref}    optional animation that is used after the
                                                             swipe ends ([bounce]{.title-ref} or
                                                             [forwards]{.title-ref})

  [onLeftSwipe]{.title-ref}          [Object]{.title-ref}    if present, the actionswiper can be swiped
                                                             to the left

  [onRightSwipe]{.title-ref}         [Object]{.title-ref}    if present, the actionswiper can be swiped
                                                             to the right

                                                             swiped to perform the action
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use both [onLeftSwipe]{.title-ref} and
[onRightSwipe]{.title-ref} props at the same time.

The [Object]{.title-ref}\'s used for the left/right swipe must contain:

> - [action]{.title-ref}, which is the callable [Function]{.title-ref}
>   serving as a callback. Once the swipe has been completed in the
>   given direction, that action is performed.
> - [icon]{.title-ref} is the icon class to use, usually to represent
>   the action. It must be a [string]{.title-ref}.
> - [bgColor]{.title-ref} is the background color, given to decorate the
>   action. can be one of the following [bootstrap contextual
>   color](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#available-variations)
>   ([danger]{.title-ref}, [info]{.title-ref}, [secondary]{.title-ref},
>   [success]{.title-ref} or [warning]{.title-ref}).
>
> Those values must be given to define the behavior and the visual
> aspect of the swiper.

#### Example: Extending existing components

In the following example, you can use [xpath]{.title-ref}\'s to wrap an
existing element in the ActionSwiper component. Here, a swiper has been
added to mark a message as read in mail.

``` xml
<xpath expr="//*[hasclass('o_Message')]" position="after">
  <ActionSwiper
    onRightSwipe="messaging.device.isMobile and messageView.message.isNeedaction ?
      {
        action: () => messageView.message.markAsRead(),
        icon: 'fa-check-circle',
        bgColor: 'bg-success',
      } : undefined"
  />
</xpath>
<xpath expr="//ActionSwiper" position="inside">
  <xpath expr="//*[hasclass('o_Message')]" position="move"/>
</xpath>
```

### CheckBox {#frontend/owl/checkbox}

#### Location

[\@web/core/checkbox/checkbox]{.title-ref}

#### Description

This is a simple checkbox component with a label next to it. The
checkbox is linked to the label: the checkbox is toggled whenever the
label is clicked.

``` xml
<CheckBox value="boolean" disabled="boolean" t-on-change="onValueChange">
  Some Text
</CheckBox>
```

#### Props

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Name                     Type                    Description

  [disabled]{.title-ref}   [boolean]{.title-ref}   if true, the checkbox is disabled,
                                                   otherwise it is enabled
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ColorList {#frontend/owl/colorlist}

#### Location

[\@web/core/colorlist/colorlist]{.title-ref}

#### Description

The ColorList let you choose a color from a predefined list. By default,
the component displays the current selected color, and is not expandable
until the [canToggle]{.title-ref} props is present. Different props can
change its behavior, to always expand the list, or make it act as a
toggler once it is clicked, to display the list of available colors
until a choice is selected.

#### Props

### Dropdown {#frontend/owl/dropdown}

#### Location

[\@web/core/dropdown/dropdown]{.title-ref} and
[\@web/core/dropdown/dropdown_item]{.title-ref}

#### Description

The Dropdown lets you show a menu with a list of items when a toggle is
clicked on. They can be combined with DropdownItems to invoke callbacks
and close the menu when items are selected.

Dropdowns are surprisingly complicated components, the list of features
they provide is as follow:

- Toggle the item list on click
- Close on outside click
- Call a function when items are selected
- Optionally close the item list when an item is selected
- SIY: style it yourself
- Support sub dropdowns, up to any level
- Configurable hotkey to open/close a dropdown or select a dropdown item
- Keyboard navigation (arrows, tab, shift+tab, home, end, enter and
  escape)
- Reposition itself whenever the page scrolls or is resized
- Smartly chose the direction it should open (right-to-left direction is
  automatically handled).
- Direct siblings dropdowns: when one is open, toggle others on hover

To properly use a [\<Dropdown/\>]{.title-ref} component, you need to
populate two [OWL
slots](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/reference/slots.md) :

- [default]{.title-ref} slot: it contains the *toggle* elements of your
  dropdown. By default, click events will be attached to this element to
  open and close the dropdown.
- [content]{.title-ref} slot: it contains the *elements* of the dropdown
  menu itself and is rendered inside a popover. Although it is not
  mandatory, you can put some [DropdownItem]{.title-ref} inside this
  slot, the dropdown will automatically close when these items are
  selected.

``` xml
<Dropdown>
  <!-- The content of the "default" slot is the component's toggle -->
  <button class="my-btn" type="button">
    Click me to toggle the dropdown menu!
  </button>

  <!-- The "content" slot is rendered inside the menu that pops up next to the toggle -->
  <t t-set-slot="content">
    <DropdownItem onSelected="selectItem1">Menu Item 1</DropdownItem>
    <DropdownItem onSelected="selectItem2">Menu Item 2</DropdownItem>
  </t>
</Dropdown>
```

  --------------------------- --------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [class]{.title-ref}         [String]{.title-ref} or     Optional value added to the root span classname (supports both strings and [OWL classname object
                              [Object]{.title-ref}        notation](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/reference/templates.md#dynamic-class-attribute)).

  [onSelected]{.title-ref}    [Function]{.title-ref}      Optional function called when the dropdown item is selected.

  [closingMode]{.title-ref}   [\"none\"]{.title-ref} \|   Optional, controls which parent dropdown should close when the item is selected: \`none\`: the dropdown
                              [\"closest\"]{.title-ref}   will not close, \`closest\`: the direct parent will close, \`all\`: every nested parent dropdown will

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When writing custom css for you components, do not forget that the menu
elements are not next to the toggle but inside the overlay container, at
the bottom of the document. Thus, use the [menuClass]{.title-ref} and
[class]{.title-ref} props to more easily write your selectors. (This DOM
magic let us avoid lots of z-index issues.)
::::

#### Nested Dropdown

Dropdown can be nested, to do this simply put new Dropdown components
inside other dropdown\'s content slot. When the parent dropdown is open,
child dropdowns will open automatically on hover.

By default, selecting a DropdownItem will close the whole Dropdown tree.

::: example
This example shows how one could make a nested File dropdown menu, with
submenus for the New sub elements.

``` xml
<Dropdown>
  <button>File</button>
  <t t-set-slot="content">
    <DropdownItem onSelected="() => this.onItemSelected('file-save')">Save</DropdownItem>
    <DropdownItem onSelected="() => this.onItemSelected('file-open')">Open</DropdownItem>

    <Dropdown>
      <button>New</button>
      <t t-set-slot="content">
        <DropdownItem onSelected="() => this.onItemSelected('file-new-document')">Document</DropdownItem>
        <DropdownItem onSelected="() => this.onItemSelected('file-new-spreadsheet')">Spreadsheet</DropdownItem>
      </t>
    </Dropdown>
  </t>
</Dropdown>
```

In the example bellow, we recursively call a template to display a
tree-like structure.

``` xml
<t t-name="addon.MainTemplate">
  <div>
    <t t-call="addon.RecursiveDropdown">
      <t t-set="name" t-value="'Main Menu'" />
      <t t-set="items" t-value="state.menuItems" />
    </t>
  </div>
</t>

<t t-name="addon.RecursiveDropdown">
  <Dropdown>
    <button t-esc="name"></button>
    <t t-set-slot="content">
      <t t-foreach="items" t-as="item" t-key="item.id">

        <!-- If this item has no child: make it a <DropdownItem/> -->
        <DropdownItem t-if="!item.childrenTree.length" onSelected="() => this.onItemSelected(item)" t-esc="item.name"/>

        <!-- Else: recursively call the current dropdown template. -->
        <t t-else="" t-call="addon.RecursiveDropdown">
          <t t-set="name" t-value="item.name" />
          <t t-set="items" t-value="item.childrenTree" />
        </t>
      </t>
    </t>
  </Dropdown>
</t>
```
:::

#### Controlled Dropdown

If needed, you can also open or close the dropdown using code. To do
this you must use the [useDropdownState]{.title-ref} hook along with the
[state]{.title-ref} prop. [useDropdownState]{.title-ref} returns an
object that has an [open]{.title-ref} and a [close]{.title-ref} method
(as well as an [isOpen]{.title-ref} getter). Give the object to the
[state]{.title-ref} prop of the dropdown you want to control and calling
the respective functions should now open and close your dropdown.

You can also set [manual]{.title-ref} to [true]{.title-ref} if you
don\'t want the default click handlers to be added on the toggle.

::: example
The following example shows a dropdown that opens automatically when
mounted and only has a 50% chance of closing when clicking on the button
inside.

``` javascript
import { Component, onMounted } from "@odoo/owl";
import { Dropdown } from "@web/core/dropdown/dropdown";
import { DropdownItem } from "@web/core/dropdown/dropdown_item";
import { useDropdownState } from "@web/core/dropdown/dropdown_hooks";

class MyComponent extends Component {

  static components = { Dropdown, DropdownItem };
  static template = xml`
    <Dropdown state="this.dropdown">
      <div>My Dropdown</div>

      <t t-set-slot="content">
        <button t-on-click="() => this.mightClose()">Close It!<button>
      </t>
    </Dropdown>
  `;

  setup() {
    this.dropdown = useDropdownState();

    onMounted(() => {
      this.dropdown.open();
    });
  }

  mightClose() {
    if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
      this.dropdown.close();
    }
  }
}
```
:::

#### DropdownGroup

**Location:** [\@web/core/dropdown/dropdown_group]{.title-ref}

You can use the DropdownGroup component to make Dropdowns share a common
group, this means that when one of these Dropdown is open, the others
will automatically open themselves on mouse hover, without the need for
a click.

To do this, either surround all the Dropdowns with a single
DropdownGroup or surround them with DropdownGroups with the same
[group]{.title-ref} key.

::: example
In the example bellow, all dropdown in the snippet bellow will share the
same group:

``` xml
<DropdownGroup>
  <Dropdown>...</Dropdown>
  <Dropdown>...</Dropdown>
  <Dropdown>...</Dropdown>
</DropdownGroup>
```

Whereas in the following snippet, only the first, second and fourth
dropdown share the same group:

``` xml
<DropdownGroup group="'my-group'">
  <Dropdown>...</Dropdown>
  <Dropdown>...</Dropdown>
</DropdownGroup>

<DropdownGroup group="'my-other-group'">
  <Dropdown>...</Dropdown>
</DropdownGroup>

<DropdownGroup group="'my-group'">
  <Dropdown>...</Dropdown>
</DropdownGroup>
```

### Notebook {#frontend/owl/notebook}

#### Location

[\@web/core/notebook/notebook]{.title-ref}

#### Description

The Notebook is made to display multiple pages in a tabbed interface.
Tabs can be located at the top of the element to display horizontally,
or at the left for a vertical layout.

There are two ways to define your Notebook pages to instanciate, either
by using [slot]{.title-ref}\'s, or by passing a dedicated
[props]{.title-ref}.

A page can be disabled with the [isDisabled]{.title-ref} attribute, set
directly on the slot node, or in the page declaration, if the Notebook
is used with the [pages]{.title-ref} given as props. Once disabled, the
corresponding tab is greyed out and set as inactive as well.

#### Props

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Name                         Type                     Description
  ---------------------------- ------------------------ ------------------------------------------
  [anchors]{.title-ref}        [object]{.title-ref}     optional. Allow anchors navigation to
                                                        elements inside tabs that are not visible.

  [className]{.title-ref}      [string]{.title-ref}     optional. Classname set on the root of the
                                                        component.

  [defaultPage]{.title-ref}    [string]{.title-ref}     optional. Page [id]{.title-ref} to display
                                                        by default.

  [icons]{.title-ref}          [array]{.title-ref}      optional. List of icons used in the tabs.

  [orientation]{.title-ref}    [string]{.title-ref}     optional. Whether tabs direction is
                                                        [horizontal]{.title-ref} or
                                                        [vertical]{.title-ref}.

  [onPageUpdate]{.title-ref}   [function]{.title-ref}   optional. Callback executed once the page
                                                        has changed.

  [pages]{.title-ref}          [array]{.title-ref}      optional. Contain the list of
                                                        [page]{.title-ref}\'s to populate from a
                                                        template.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: example
The first approach is to set the pages in the slots of the component.

``` xml
<Notebook orientation="'vertical'">
  <t t-set-slot="page_1" title="'Page 1'" isVisible="true">
    <h1>My First Page</h1>
    <p>It's time to build Owl components. Did you read the documentation?</p>
  </t>
  <t t-set-slot="page_2" title="'2nd page'" isVisible="true">
    <p>Wise owl's silent flight. Through the moonlit forest deep, guides my path to code</p>
  </t>
</Notebook>
```

The other way to define your pages is by passing the props. This can be
useful if some pages share the same structure. Create first a component
for each page template that you may use.

``` javascript
import { Component, xml } from "@odoo/owl";
import { Notebook } from "@web/core/notebook/notebook";

class MyTemplateComponent extends Component {
  static template = xml`
    <h1 t-esc="props.title" />
    <p t-esc="props.text" />
  `;
}

class MyComponent extends Component {
  static template = xml`
    <Notebook defaultPage="'page_2'" pages="pages" />
  `;

  get pages() {
    return [
      {
        Component: MyTemplateComponent,
        title: "Page 1",
        props: {
          title: "My First Page",
          text: "This page is not visible",
        },
      },
      {
        Component: MyTemplateComponent,
        id: "page_2",
        title: "Page 2",
        props: {
          title: "My second page",
          text: "You're at the right place!",
        },
      },
    ]
  }
}
```

### Pager {#frontend/pager}

#### Location

[\@web/core/pager/pager]{.title-ref}

#### Description

The Pager is a small component to handle pagination. A page is defined
by an [offset]{.title-ref} and a [limit]{.title-ref} (the size of the
page). It displays the current page and the [total]{.title-ref} number
of elements, for instance, \"9-12 / 20\". In the previous example,
[offset]{.title-ref} is 8, [limit]{.title-ref} is 4 and
[total]{.title-ref} is 20. It has two buttons (\"Previous\" and
\"Next\") to navigate between pages.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The pager can be used anywhere but its main use is in the control panel.
See the `usePager <frontend/hooks/usepager>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} hook in order to manipulate the pager of the control panel.

### SelectMenu {#frontend/select_menu}

#### Location

[\@web/core/select_menu/select_menu]{.title-ref}

#### Description

This component can be used when you want to do more than using the
native [select]{.title-ref} element. You can define your own option
template, allowing to search between your options, or group them in
subsections.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Prefer the native HTML [select]{.title-ref} element, as it provides by
default accessibility features, and has a better user interface on
mobile devices. This component is designed to be used for more complex
use cases, to overcome limitations of the native element.

                                                             multiple selection is enabled, selected values
                                                             are displayed as
                                                             `tag <frontend/tags_list>`{.interpreted-text
                                                             role="ref"}\'s in the SelectMenu input.

  [togglerClass]{.title-ref}        [string]{.title-ref}     optional. classname set on the toggler button.

  [required]{.title-ref}            [boolean]{.title-ref}    optional. Whether the selected value can be
                                                             unselected.

  [searchable]{.title-ref}          [boolean]{.title-ref}    optional. Whether a search box is visible in
                                                             the dropdown.

  [searchPlaceholder]{.title-ref}   [string]{.title-ref}     optional. Text displayed as the search box
                                                             placeholder.

  [value]{.title-ref}               [any]{.title-ref}        optional. Current selected value. It can be
                                                             from any kind of type.

  [onSelect]{.title-ref}            [function]{.title-ref}   optional. Callback executed when an option is
                                                             chosen.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The shape of a [choice]{.title-ref} is the following:

> - [value]{.title-ref} is actual value of the choice. It is usually a
>   technical string, but can be from [any]{.title-ref} type.
> - [label]{.title-ref} is the displayed text associated with the
>   option. This one is usually a more friendly and translated
>   [string]{.title-ref}.

The shape of a [group]{.title-ref} is the following:

> - [choices]{.title-ref} is the list of [choice]{.title-ref}\'s to
>   display for this group.
> - [label]{.title-ref} is the displayed text associated with the group.
>   This is a [string]{.title-ref} displayed at the top of the group.

::: example
In the following example, the SelectMenu will display four choices. One
of them is displayed on top of the options, since no groups are
associated with it, but the other ones are separated by the label of
their group.

``` javascript
import { Component, xml } from "@odoo/owl";
import { SelectMenu } from "@web/core/select_menu/select_menu";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  static template = xml`
    <SelectMenu
      choices="choices"
      groups="groups"
      value="'value_2'"
    />
  `;

  get choices() {
    return [
        {
          value: "value_1",
          label: "First value"
        }
    ]
  }
  get groups() {
    return [
      {
          label: "Group A",
          choices: [
              {
                value: "value_2",
                label: "Second value"
              },
              {
                value: "value_3",
                label: "Third value"
              }
          ]
      },
      {
          label: "Group B",
          choices: [
              {
                value: "value_4",
                label: "Fourth value"
              }
          ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also customize the appearance of the toggler and set a custom
template for the choices, using the appropriate component
[slot]{.title-ref}\'s.

``` xml
<SelectMenu
  choices="choices"
  groups="groups"
  value="'value_2'"
>
  Make a choice!
  <t t-set-slot="choice" t-slot-scope="choice">
    <span class="coolClass" t-esc="'👉 ' + choice.data.label + ' 👈'" />
  </t>
</SelectMenu>
```

![Example of SelectMenu usage and customization](owl_components/select_menu.png){.align-center
width="400px"}

When SelectMenu is used with multiple selection, the [value]{.title-ref}
props must be an [Array]{.title-ref} containing the values of the
selected choices.

![Example of SelectMenu used with multiple selection](owl_components/select_menu_multiSelect.png){.align-center
width="350px"}

For more advanced use cases, you can customize the bottom area of the
dropdown, using the [bottomArea]{.title-ref} slot. Here, we choose to
display a button with the corresponding value set in the search input.

``` xml
<SelectMenu
    choices="choices"
>
    <span class="select_menu_test">Select something</span>
    <t t-set-slot="bottomArea" t-slot-scope="select">
        <div t-if="select.data.searchValue">
            <button class="btn text-primary" t-on-click="() => this.onCreate(select.data.searchValue)">
                Create this article "<i t-esc="select.data.searchValue" />"
            </button>
        </div>
    </t>
</SelectMenu>
```

### TagsList {#frontend/tags_list}

#### Location

[\@web/core/tags_list/tags_list]{.title-ref}

#### Description

This component can display a list of tags in rounded pills. Those tags
can either simply list a few values, or can be editable, allowing the
removal of items. It can be possible to limit the number of displayed
items using the [itemsVisible]{.title-ref} props. If the list is longer
than this limit, the number of additional items is shown in a circle
next to the last tag.

#### Props

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Name                         Type                    Description
  ---------------------------- ----------------------- ------------------------------------------
  [displayBadge]{.title-ref}   [boolean]{.title-ref}   optional. Whether the tag is displayed as
                                                       a badge.

  [displayText]{.title-ref}    [boolean]{.title-ref}   optional. Whether the tag is displayed
                                                       with a text or not.

  [itemsVisible]{.title-ref}   [number]{.title-ref}    optional. Limit of visible tags in the
                                                       list.

  [tags]{.title-ref}           [array]{.title-ref}     list of [tag]{.title-ref}\'s elements
                                                       given to the component.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The shape of a [tag]{.title-ref} is the following:

> - [colorIndex]{.title-ref} is an optional color id.
> - [icon]{.title-ref} is an optional icon displayed just before the
>   displayed text.
> - [id]{.title-ref} is a unique identifier for the tag.
> - [img]{.title-ref} is an optional image displayed in a circle, just
>   before the displayed text.
> - [onClick]{.title-ref} is an optional callback that can be given to
>   the element. This allows the parent element to handle any
>   functionality depending on the tag clicked.
> - [onDelete]{.title-ref} is an optional callback that can be given to
>   the element. This makes the removal of the item from the list of
>   tags possible, and must be handled by the parent element.
> - [text]{.title-ref} is the displayed [string]{.title-ref} associated
>   with the tag.

::: example
In the next example, a TagsList component is used to display multiple
tags. It\'s at the developer to handle from the parent what would happen
when the tag is pressed, or when the delete button is clicked.

``` javascript
import { Component, xml } from "@odoo/owl";
import { TagsList } from "@web/core/tags_list/tags_list";

class Parent extends Component {
  static template = xml`<TagsList tags="tags" />`;
  static components = { TagsList };

  setup() {
    this.tags = [{
        id: "tag1",
        text: "Earth"
    }, {
        colorIndex: 1,
        id: "tag2",
        text: "Wind",
        onDelete: () => {...}
    }, {
        colorIndex: 2,
        id: "tag3",
        text: "Fire",
        onClick: () => {...},
        onDelete: () => {...}
    }];
  }
}
```

Depending the attributes given to each tag, their appearance and
behavior will differ.

# Patching code

Sometimes, we need to customize the way the UI works. Many common needs
are covered by some supported API. For example, all registries are good
extension points: the field registry allows adding/removing specialized
field components, or the main component registry allows adding
components that should be displayed all the time.

However, there are situations for which it is not sufficient. In those
cases, we may need to modify an object or a class in place. To achieve
that, Odoo provides the utility function [patch]{.title-ref}. It is
mostly useful to override/update the behavior of some other
component/piece of code that one does not control.

## Description

The patch function is located in \`@web/core/utils/patch\`:

> 
>
> param object objToPatch
> :   the object that should be patched
>
> param object extension
> :   an object mapping each key to an extension
>
> returns
> :   a function to remove the patch
>
> The [patch]{.title-ref} function modifies in place the
> [objToPatch]{.title-ref} object (or class) and applies all key/value
> described in the [extension]{.title-ref} object. An unpatch function
> is returned, so it can be used to remove the patch later if necessary.
>
> Most patch operations provide access to the parent value by using the
> native [super]{.title-ref} keyword (see below in the examples).

## Patching a simple object

Here is a simple example of how an object can be patched:

``` javascript
import { patch } from "@web/core/utils/patch";

const object = {
  field: "a field",
  fn() {
    // do something
  },
};

patch(object, {
  fn() {
    // do things
  },
});
```

When patching functions, we usually want to be able to access the
`parent` function. To do so, we can simply use the native `super`
keyword:

``` javascript
patch(object, {
  fn() {
    super.fn(...arguments);
    // do other things
  },
});
```

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

`super` can only be used in a method not a function. This means that the
following constructs are invalid for javascript.

``` javascript
const obj = {
  a: function () {
    // Throws: "Uncaught SyntaxError: 'super' keyword unexpected here"
    super.a();
  },
  b: () => {
    // Throws: "Uncaught SyntaxError: 'super' keyword unexpected here"
    super.b();
  },
};
```
::::

Getters and setters are supported too:

``` javascript
patch(object, {
  get number() {
    return super.number / 2;
  },
  set number(value) {
    super.number = value;
  },
});
```

## Patching a javascript class {#frontend/patching_class}

The `patch` function is designed to work with anything: object or ES6
class.

However, since javascript classes work with the prototypal inheritance,
when one wishes to patch a standard method from a class, then we
actually need to patch the \`prototype\`:

``` javascript
class MyClass {
  static myStaticFn() {...}
  myPrototypeFn() {...}
}

// this will patch static properties!!!
patch(MyClass, {
  myStaticFn() {...},
});

// this is probably the usual case: patching a class method
patch(MyClass.prototype, {
  myPrototypeFn() {...},
});
```

Also, Javascript handles the constructor in a special native way which
makes it impossible to be patched. The only workaround is to call a
method in the original constructor and patch that method instead:

``` javascript
class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    this.setup();
  }
  setup() {
    this.number = 1;
  }
}

patch(MyClass.prototype, {
  setup() {
    super.setup(...arguments);
    this.doubleNumber = this.number * 2;
  },
});
```

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

It is impossible to patch directly the [constructor]{.title-ref} of a
class!
::::

## Patching a component

Components are defined by javascript classes, so all the information
above still holds. For these reasons, Owl components should use the
[setup]{.title-ref} method, so they can easily be patched as well (see
the section on
`best practices<frontend/owl/best_practices>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}).

``` javascript
patch(MyComponent.prototype, {
  setup() {
    useMyHook();
  },
});
```

## Removing a patch

The [patch]{.title-ref} function returns its counterpart. This is mostly
useful for testing purposes, when we patch something at the beginning of
a test, and unpatch it at the end.

``` javascript
const unpatch = patch(object, { ... });
// test stuff here
unpatch();
```

## Applying the same patch to multiple objects

It could happen that one wants to apply the same patch to multiple
objects but because of the way the [super]{.title-ref} keyword works,
the [extension]{.title-ref} can only be used for patching once and
cannot be copied/cloned ([check the documentation of the
keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super#description)).
A function returning the object used to patch can be used to make it
unique.

``` javascript
const obj1 = {
  method() {
    doSomething();
  },
};

const obj2 = {
  method() {
    doThings();
  },
};

function createExtensionObj() {
  return {
    method() {
      super.method();
      doCommonThings();
    },
  };
}

patch(obj1, createExtensionObj());
patch(obj2, createExtensionObj());
```

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

If an [extension]{.title-ref} is based on another then the two
extensions should be applied separately. Do not copy/clone an extension.

``` javascript
const object = {
  method1() {
    doSomething();
  },
  method2() {
    doAnotherThing();
  },
};

const ext1 = {
  method1() {
    super.method1();
    doThings();
  },
};

const invalid_ext2 = {
  ...ext1, // this will not work: super will not refer to the correct object in methods coming from ext1
  method2() {
    super.method2();
    doOtherThings();
  },
};

patch(object, invalid_ext2);
object.method1(); // throws: Uncaught TypeError: (intermediate value).method1 is not a function

const valid_ext2 = {
  method2() {
    super.method2();
    doOtherThings();
  },
};

patch(object, ext1); // first patch base extension
patch(object, valid_ext2); // then the new one
object.method1(); // works as expected
```

# QWeb Templates {#reference/qweb}

QWeb is the primary
[templating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor) engine
used by Odoo[^1]. It is an XML templating engine[^2] and used mostly to
generate [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) fragments and pages.

Template directives are specified as XML attributes prefixed with `t-`,
for instance `t-if` for `reference/qweb/conditionals`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, with elements and other attributes being rendered directly.

To avoid element rendering, a placeholder element `<t>` is also
available, which executes its directive but doesn\'t generate any output
in and of itself:

``` xml
<t t-if="condition">
    <p>Test</p>
</t>
```

will result in:

``` xml
<p>Test</p>
```

if `condition` is true, but:

``` xml
<div t-if="condition">
    <p>Test</p>
</div>
```

will result in:

``` xml
<div>
    <p>Test</p>
</div>
```

## Data output {#reference/qweb/output}

QWeb\'s output directive `out` will automatically HTML-escape its input,
limiting [XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) risks
when displaying user-provided content.

`out` takes an expression, evaluates it and injects the result in the
document:

``` xml
<p><t t-out="value"/></p>
```

rendered with the value `value` set to `42` yields:

``` xml
<p>42</p>
```

See `reference/qweb/advanced-output`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for
more advanced topics (e.g. injecting raw HTML, etc\...).

## Conditionals {#reference/qweb/conditionals}

QWeb has a conditional directive `if`, which evaluates an expression
given as attribute value:

``` xml
<div>
    <t t-if="condition">
        <p>ok</p>
    </t>
</div>
```

The element is rendered if the condition is true:

``` xml
<div>
    <p>ok</p>
</div>
```

but if the condition is false it is removed from the result:

``` xml
<div>
</div>
```

The conditional rendering applies to the bearer of the directive, which
does not have to be `<t>`:

``` xml
<div>
    <p t-if="condition">ok</p>
</div>
```

will give the same results as the previous example.

Extra conditional branching directives `t-elif` and `t-else` are also
available:

``` xml
<div>
    <p t-if="user.birthday == today()">Happy birthday!</p>
    <p t-elif="user.login == 'root'">Welcome master!</p>
    <p t-else="">Welcome!</p>
</div>
```

## Loops {#reference/qweb/loops}

QWeb has an iteration directive `foreach` which take an expression
returning the collection to iterate on, and a second parameter `t-as`
providing the name to use for the \"current item\" of the iteration:

``` xml
<t t-foreach="[1, 2, 3]" t-as="i">
    <p><t t-out="i"/></p>
</t>
```

will be rendered as:

``` xml
<p>1</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>3</p>
```

Like conditions, `foreach` applies to the element bearing the
directive\'s attribute, and

``` xml
<p t-foreach="[1, 2, 3]" t-as="i">
    <t t-out="i"/>
</p>
```

is equivalent to the previous example.

`foreach` can iterate on an array (the current item will be the current
value) or a mapping (the current item will be the current key).
Iterating on an integer (equivalent to iterating on an array between 0
inclusive and the provided integer exclusive) is still supported but
deprecated.

In addition to the name passed via `t-as`, `foreach` provides a few
other variables for various data points:

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

`$as` will be replaced by the name passed to `t-as`
::::

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`{$as}_all`{.interpreted-text role="samp"} (deprecated)

:   the object being iterated over

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    This variable is only available on JavaScript QWeb, not Python.
    ::::

`{$as}_value`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

:   the current iteration value, identical to `$as` for lists and
    integers, but for mappings it provides the value (where `$as`
    provides the key)

`{$as}_index`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

:   the current iteration index (the first item of the iteration has
    index 0)

`{$as}_size`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

:   the size of the collection if it is available

`{$as}_first`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

:   whether the current item is the first of the iteration (equivalent
    to `{$as}_index == 0`{.interpreted-text role="samp"})

`{$as}_last`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

:   whether the current item is the last of the iteration (equivalent to
    `{$as}_index + 1 == {$as}_size`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}),
    requires the iteratee\'s size be available

`{$as}_parity`{.interpreted-text role="samp"} (deprecated)

:   either `"even"` or `"odd"`, the parity of the current iteration
    round

`{$as}_even`{.interpreted-text role="samp"} (deprecated)

:   a boolean flag indicating that the current iteration round is on an
    even index

`{$as}_odd`{.interpreted-text role="samp"} (deprecated)

:   a boolean flag indicating that the current iteration round is on an
    odd index

These extra variables provided and all new variables created into the
`foreach` are only available in the scope of the `foreach`. If the
variable exists outside the context of the `foreach`, the value is
copied at the end of the foreach into the global context.

``` xml
<t t-set="existing_variable" t-value="False"/>
<!-- existing_variable now False -->

<p t-foreach="[1, 2, 3]" t-as="i">
    <t t-set="existing_variable" t-value="True"/>
    <t t-set="new_variable" t-value="True"/>
    <!-- existing_variable and new_variable now True -->
</p>

<!-- existing_variable always True -->
<!-- new_variable undefined -->
```

## attributes {#reference/qweb/attributes}

QWeb can compute attributes on-the-fly and set the result of the
computation on the output node. This is done via the `t-att` (attribute)
directive which exists in 3 different forms:

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`t-att-{$name}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

:   an attribute called `$name` is created, the attribute value is
    evaluated and the result is set as the attribute\'s value:

    ``` xml
    <div t-att-a="42"/>
    ```

    will be rendered as:

    ``` xml
    <div a="42"></div>
    ```

`t-attf-{$name}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

:   same as previous, but the parameter is a
    `format string`{.interpreted-text role="term"} instead of just an
    expression, often useful to mix literal and non-literal string (e.g.
    classes):

    ``` xml
    <t t-foreach="[1, 2, 3]" t-as="item">
        <li t-attf-class="row {{ (item_index % 2 === 0) ? 'even' : 'odd' }}">
            <t t-out="item"/>
        </li>
    </t>
    ```

    will be rendered as:

    ``` xml
    <li class="row even">1</li>
    <li class="row odd">2</li>
    <li class="row even">3</li>
    ```

    :::: tip
    ::: title
    Tip
    :::

    There are two equivalent syntaxes for format strings:
    `"plain_text {{code}}"` (aka jinja-style) and `"plain_text #{code}"`
    (aka ruby-style).
    ::::

`t-att=mapping`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

:   if the parameter is a mapping, each (key, value) pair generates a
    new attribute and its value:

    ``` xml
    <div t-att="{'a': 1, 'b': 2}"/>
    ```

    will be rendered as:

    ``` xml
    <div a="1" b="2"></div>
    ```

`t-att=pair`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}

:   if the parameter is a pair (tuple or array of 2 element), the first
    item of the pair is the name of the attribute and the second item is
    the value:

    ``` xml
    <div t-att="['a', 'b']"/>
    ```

    will be rendered as:

    ``` xml
    <div a="b"></div>
    ```

## setting variables {#reference/qweb/set}

QWeb allows creating variables from within the template, to memoize a
computation (to use it multiple times), give a piece of data a clearer
name, \...

This is done via the `set` directive, which takes the name of the
variable to create. The value to set can be provided in two ways:

- a `t-value` attribute containing an expression, and the result of its
  evaluation will be set:

  ``` xml
  <t t-set="foo" t-value="2 + 1"/>
  <t t-out="foo"/>
  ```

  will print `3`

- if there is no `t-value` attribute, the node\'s body is rendered and
  set as the variable\'s value:

  ``` xml
  <t t-set="foo">
      <li>ok</li>
  </t>
  <t t-out="foo"/>
  ```

## calling sub-templates[]{#reference/qweb/call} {#reference/qweb/sub-templates}

QWeb templates can be used for top-level rendering, but they can also be
used from within another template (to avoid duplication or give names to
parts of templates) using the `t-call` directive:

``` xml
<t t-call="other-template"/>
```

This calls the named template with the execution context of the parent,
if `other_template` is defined as:

``` xml
<p><t t-value="var"/></p>
```

the call above will be rendered as `<p/>` (no content), but:

``` xml
<t t-set="var" t-value="1"/>
<t t-call="other-template"/>
```

will be rendered as `<p>1</p>`.

However, this has the problem of being visible from outside the
`t-call`. Alternatively, content set in the body of the `call` directive
will be evaluated *before* calling the sub-template, and can alter a
local context:

``` xml
<t t-call="other-template">
    <t t-set="var" t-value="1"/>
</t>
<!-- "var" does not exist here -->
```

The body of the `call` directive can be arbitrarily complex (not just
`set` directives), and its rendered form will be available within the
called template as a magical `0` variable:

``` xml
<div>
    This template was called with content:
    <t t-out="0"/>
</div>
```

being called thus:

``` xml
<t t-call="other-template">
    <em>content</em>
</t>
```

will result in:

``` xml
<div>
    This template was called with content:
    <em>content</em>
</div>
```

## Advanced Output {#reference/qweb/advanced-output}

By default, `out` should HTML-escape content which needs to be escaped,
protecting the system against
[XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting)

Content which does *not* need to be escaped will instead be injected
as-is in the document, and may become part of the document\'s actual
markup.

The only cross-platform \"safe\" content is the output of
`t-call <reference/qweb/call>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or a
`t-set <reference/qweb/set>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} used with a
\"body\" (as opposed to `t-value` or `t-valuef`).

### Python

Usually you should not have to care too much: APIs for which it makes
sense should generate \"safe\" content automatically, and things should
work transparently.

For the cases where things need to be clearer though the following APIs
output safe content which will by default not be (re-)escaped when
injected into templates:

- `HTML fields <odoo.fields.Html>`{.interpreted-text role="class"}.

- `~odoo.tools.misc.html_escape`{.interpreted-text role="func"} and
  `markupsafe.escape`{.interpreted-text role="func"} (they are aliases,
  and have no risk of double-escaping).

- `~odoo.tools.mail.html_sanitize`{.interpreted-text role="func"}.

- `markupsafe.Markup`{.interpreted-text role="class"}.

  :::: warning
  ::: title
  Warning
  :::

  `markupsafe.Markup`{.interpreted-text role="class"} is an unsafe API,
  it\'s an *assertion* that you want the content to be markup-safe but
  necessarily can not check that, it should be used with care.
  ::::

- `~odoo.tools.pycompat.to_text`{.interpreted-text role="func"} does not
  mark the content as safe, but will not strip that information from
  safe content.

### forcing double-escaping

If content is marked as safe but for some reason needs to be escaped
anyway (e.g. printing the markup of an HTML fields), it can just be
converted back to a normal string to \"strip\" the safety flag e.g.
[str(content)]{.title-ref} in Python and [String(content)]{.title-ref}
in Javascript.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Because `~markupsafe.Markup`{.interpreted-text role="class"} is a much
richer type than `Markup`{.interpreted-text role="js:class"}, some
operations will strip the safety information from a
`Markup`{.interpreted-text role="js:class"} but not a
`~markupsafe.Markup`{.interpreted-text role="class"} e.g. string
concatenation (`'' + content`) in Python will result in a
`~markupsafe.Markup`{.interpreted-text role="class"} with the other
operand having been properly escaped, while in Javascript will yield a
`String`{.interpreted-text role="js:class"} where the other operand was
*not* escaped before the concatenation.
::::

### Deprecated output directives

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`esc`

:   An alias for `out`, would originally HTML-escape its input. Not yet
    formally deprecated as the only difference between `out` and `esc`
    is that the latter is a bit unclear / incorrect.

`raw`

:   A version of `out` which *never* escapes its content. Content is
    emitted as-is, whether it\'s safe or not.

    ::: deprecated
    15.0

    Use `out` with a `markupsafe.Markup`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
    value instead.

    `t-raw` was deprecated because as the code *producting* the content
    evolves it can be hard to track that it\'s going to be used for
    markup, leading to more complicated reviews and more dangerous
    lapses.
    :::

## Python

### Exclusive directives

#### Asset bundles

::: todo
have fme write these up because I\'ve no idea how they work
:::

#### \"smart records\" fields formatting

The `t-field` directive can only be used when performing field access
(`a.b`) on a \"smart\" record (result of the `browse` method). It is
able to automatically format based on field type, and is integrated in
the website\'s rich text editing.

`t-options` can be used to customize fields, the most common option is
`widget`, other options are field- or widget-dependent.

### Debugging

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`t-debug`

:   with an empty value, invokes the `breakpoint`{.interpreted-text
    role="func"} builtin function, which usually invokes a debugger
    (`pdb`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} by default).

    The behaviour can be configured via
    `PYTHONBREAKPOINT`{.interpreted-text role="envvar"} or
    `sys.breakpointhook`{.interpreted-text role="func"}.

### Helpers

#### Request-based

Most Python-side uses of QWeb are in controllers (and during HTTP
requests), in which case templates stored in the database (as
`views <reference/view_architectures/qweb>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}) can be trivially rendered by calling
`odoo.http.HttpRequest.render`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}:

``` python
response = http.request.render('my-template', {
    'context_value': 42
})
```

This automatically creates a `~odoo.http.Response`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} object which can be returned from the controller (or
further customized to suit).

#### View-based

At a deeper level than the previous helper is the `_render` method on
`ir.qweb` (use the datable) and the public module method `render`
(don\'t use the database):

> Renders a QWeb view/template by database id or
> `external id`{.interpreted-text role="term"}. Templates are
> automatically loaded from `ir.qweb` records.
>
> `_prepare_environment` method sets up a number of default values in
> the rendering context. The `http_routing` and `website` addons, also
> default values they need. You can use `minimal_qcontext=False` option
> to avoid this default value like the public method `render`:

## Javascript

### Exclusive directives

#### Defining templates

The `t-name` directive can only be placed at the top-level of a template
file (direct children to the document root):

``` xml
<templates>
    <t t-name="template-name">
        <!-- template code -->
    </t>
</templates>
```

It takes no other parameter, but can be used with a `<t>` element or any
other. With a `<t>` element, the `<t>` should have a single child.

The template name is an arbitrary string, although when multiple
templates are related (e.g. called sub-templates) it is customary to use
dot-separated names to indicate hierarchical relationships.

#### Template inheritance {#reference/qweb/template_inheritance}

Template inheritance is used to either:

:   - Alter existing templates in-place, e.g. to add information to
      templates

created by other modules.

:   - Create a new template from a given parent template

Template inheritance is performed via the use of two directives:

:   - `t-inherit` which is the name of the template to inherit from,
    - `t-inherit-mode` which is the behaviour of the inheritance: it can
      either be set to `primary` to create a new child template from the
      parented one or to `extension` to alter the parent template in
      place.

An optional `t-name` directive can also be specified. It will be the
name of the newly created template if used in primary mode, else it will
be added as a comment on the transformed template to help retrace
inheritances.

For the inheritance itself, the changes are done using xpaths
directives. See the
[XPATH](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath)
documentation for the complete set of available instructions.

Primary inheritance (child template):

``` xml
<t t-name="child.template" t-inherit="base.template" t-inherit-mode="primary">
    <xpath expr="//ul" position="inside">
        <li>new element</li>
    </xpath>
</t>
```

Extension inheritance (in-place transformation):

``` xml
<t t-inherit="base.template" t-inherit-mode="extension">
    <xpath expr="//tr[1]" position="after">
        <tr><td>new cell</td></tr>
    </xpath>
</t>
```

#### Old inheritance mechanism (deprecated)

Template inheritance is performed via the `t-extend` directive which
takes the name of the template to alter as parameter.

The directive `t-extend` will act as a primary inheritance when combined
with `t-name` and as an extension one when used alone.

In both cases the alteration is then performed with any number of
`t-jquery` sub-directives:

``` xml
<t t-extend="base.template">
    <t t-jquery="ul" t-operation="append">
        <li>new element</li>
    </t>
</t>
```

The `t-jquery` directives takes a [CSS
selector](https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/). This selector is
used on the extended template to select *context nodes* to which the
specified `t-operation` is applied:

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`append`

:   the node\'s body is appended at the end of the context node (after
    the context node\'s last child)

`prepend`

:   the node\'s body is prepended to the context node (inserted before
    the context node\'s first child)

`before`

:   the node\'s body is inserted right before the context node

`after`

:   the node\'s body is inserted right after the context node

`inner`

:   the node\'s body replaces the context node\'s children

`replace`

:   the node\'s body is used to replace the context node itself

`attributes`

:   the nodes\'s body should be any number of `attribute` elements, each
    with a `name` attribute and some textual content, the named
    attribute of the context node will be set to the specified value
    (either replaced if it already existed or added if not)

No operation

:   if no `t-operation` is specified, the template body is interpreted
    as javascript code and executed with the context node as `this`

    :::: warning
    ::: title
    Warning
    :::

    while much more powerful than other operations, this mode is also
    much harder to debug and maintain, it is recommended to avoid it
    ::::

### debugging

The javascript QWeb implementation provides a few debugging hooks:

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`t-log`

:   takes an expression parameter, evaluates the expression during
    rendering and logs its result with `console.log`:

    ``` xml
    <t t-set="foo" t-value="42"/>
    <t t-log="foo"/>
    ```

    will print `42` to the console

`t-debug`

:   triggers a debugger breakpoint during template rendering:

    ``` xml
    <t t-if="a_test">
        <t t-debug=""/>
    </t>
    ```

    will stop execution if debugging is active (exact condition depend
    on the browser and its development tools)

`t-js`

:   the node\'s body is javascript code executed during template
    rendering. Takes a `context` parameter, which is the name under
    which the rendering context will be available in the `t-js`\'s body:

    ``` xml
    <t t-set="foo" t-value="42"/>
    <t t-js="ctx">
        console.log("Foo is", ctx.foo);
    </t>
    ```

[^1]: although it uses a few others, either for historical reasons or
    because they remain better fits for the use case. Odoo 9.0 still
    depends on [Jinja](##REF##Jinja) and [Mako](##REF##Mako).

[^2]: it is similar in that to [Genshi](##REF##Genshi), although it does
    not use (and has no support for) [XML
    namespaces](##REF##XML namespaces)

# Registries {#frontend/registries}

Registries are (ordered) key/value maps. They are the main web client
extension points: many features provided by the Odoo javascript
framework simply look up into a registry whenever it needs a definition
for some object (such as fields, views, client actions or services).
Customizing the web client is then simply done by adding specific values
in the correct registry.

``` javascript
import { Registry } from "@web/core/registry";

const myRegistry = new Registry();

myRegistry.add("hello", "odoo");

console.log(myRegistry.get("hello"));
```

A useful feature of registries is that they maintain a set of sub
registries, obtained by the [category]{.title-ref} method. If the sub
registry does not exist yet, it is created on the fly. All registries
used by the web client are obtained in such a way from one root
registry, exported in [\@web/core/registry]{.title-ref}.

``` javascript
import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";

const fieldRegistry = registry.category("fields");
const serviceRegistry = registry.category("services");
const viewRegistry = registry.category("views");
```

available effects. See the section on the
`effect service <frontend/services/effect_registry>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for more details.

### Formatter registry {#frontend/registries/formatters}

The [formatters]{.title-ref} registry contains functions to format
values. Each formatter has the following API:

### Main components registry {#frontend/registries/main_components}

The main component registry ([main_components]{.title-ref}) is useful
for adding top level components in the web client. The webclient has a
[MainComponentsContainer]{.title-ref} as direct child. This component is
basically a live representation of the ordered list of components
registered in the main components registry.

API

:   ``` text
    interface {
        Component: Owl Component class
        props?: any
    }
    ```

For example, the [LoadingIndicator]{.title-ref} component can be added
in the registry like this:

``` javascript
registry.category("main_components").add("LoadingIndicator", {
  Component: LoadingIndicator,
});
```

### Parser registry {#frontend/registries/parsers}

The [parsers]{.title-ref} registry contains functions to parse values.
Each parser has the following API:

### Service registry {#frontend/registries/services}

The service registry (category: [services]{.title-ref}) contains all
`services <frontend/services>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} that should
be activated by the Odoo framework.

import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";

const myService = {
    dependencies: [...],
    start(env, deps) {
        // some code here
    }
};

registry.category("services").add("myService", myService);
```

### Systray registry {#frontend/registries/systray}

The systray is the zone on the right of the navbar that contains various
small components, that usually display some sort of information (like
the number of unread messages), notifications and/or let the user
interact with them.

The [systray]{.title-ref} registry contains a description of these
systray items, as objects with the following three keys:

- \`Component\`: the component class that represents the item. Its root
  element should be a [\<li\>]{.title-ref} tag, otherwise it might not
  be styled properly.
- \`props (optional)\`: props that should be given to the component
- \`isDisplayed (optional)\`: a function that takes the
  `env <frontend/framework/environment>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  and returns a boolean. If true, the systray item is displayed.
  Otherwise it is removed.

For example:

``` javascript
import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";

class MySystrayItem extends Component {
    // some component ...
}

registry.category("systray").add("myAddon.myItem", {
    Component: MySystrayItem,
});
```

The systray registry is an ordered registry (with the
[sequence]{.title-ref} number):

``` javascript
const item = {
    Component: MySystrayItem
};
registry.category("systray").add("myaddon.some_description", item, { sequence: 43 });
```

The sequence number defaults to 50. If given, this number will be used
to order the items. The lowest sequence is on the right and the highest
sequence is on the left in the systray menu.

### Usermenu registry {#frontend/registries/usermenu}

The user menu registry (category: [user_menuitems]{.title-ref}) contains
all menu items that are shown when opening the user menu (the navbar
element with the user name, on the top right).

User menu items are defined by a function taking the
`env <frontend/framework/environment>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
returning a plain object, containing the following information:

- [description]{.title-ref} : the menu item text,
- [href]{.title-ref} : (optional) if given (and truthy), the item text
  is put in a [a]{.title-ref} tag with given attribute href,
- [callback]{.title-ref} : callback to call when the item is selected,
- \`hide\`: (optional) indicates if the item should be hidden (default:
  [false]{.title-ref}),
- \`sequence\`: (optional) determines the rank of the item among the
  other dropwdown items (default: 100).

The user menu calls all the functions defining items every time it is
opened.

Example:

``` javascript
import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";

registry.category("user_menuitems").add("my item", (env) => {
    return {
        description: env._t("Technical Settings"),
        callback: () => { env.services.action_manager.doAction(3); },
        hide: (Math.random() < 0.5),
    };
});
```

# Services {#frontend/services}

Services are long lived pieces of code that provide a feature. They may
be imported by components (with `useService`) or by other services.
Also, they can declare a set of dependencies. In that sense, services
are basically a DI `dependency injection`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}
system. For example, the `notification` service provides a way to
display a notification, or the `rpc` service is the proper way to
perform a request to the Odoo server.

The following example registers a simple service that displays a
notification every 5 seconds:

``` javascript
import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";

const myService = {
    dependencies: ["notification"],
    start(env, { notification }) {
        let counter = 1;
        setInterval(() => {
            notification.add(`Tick Tock ${counter++}`);
        }, 5000);
    }
};

registry.category("services").add("myService", myService);
```

At startup, the web client starts all services present in the
[services]{.title-ref} registry. Note that the name used in the registry
is the name of the service.

Note
:::

Most code that is not a component should be *packaged* in a service, in
particular if it performs some side effect. This is very useful for
testing purposes: tests can choose which services are active, so there
are less chance for unwanted side effects interfering with the code
being tested.
::::

## Defining a service

A service needs to implement the following interface:

> Optional list of strings. It is the list of all dependencies (other
> services) that this service needs

> 
>
> param Environment env
> :   the application environment
>
> param Object deps
> :   all requested dependencies
>
> returns
> :   value of service or Promise\<value of service\>
>
> This is the main definition for the service. It can return either a
> value or a promise. In that case, the service loader simply waits for
> the promise to resolve to a value, which is then the value of the
> service.
>
> Some services do not export any value. They may just do their work
> without a need to be directly called by other code. In that case,
> their value will be set to `null` in `env.services`.

> Optional value. If given, it should be [true]{.title-ref} or a list of
> strings.
>
> Some services need to provide an asynchronous API. For example, the
> [rpc]{.title-ref} service is an asynchronous function, or the
> [orm]{.title-ref} service provides a set of functions to call the Odoo
> server.
>
> In that case, it is possible for components that use a service to be
> destroyed before the end of an asynchronous function call. Most of the
> time, the asynchronous function call needs to be ignored. Doing
> otherwise is potentially very risky, because the underlying component
> is no longer active. The [async]{.title-ref} flag is a way to do just
> that: it signals to the service creator that all asynchronous calls
> coming from components should be left pending if the component is
> destroyed.

## Using a service

A service that depends on other services and has properly declared its
`dependencies` simply receives a reference to the corresponding services
in the second argument of the `start` method.

The `useService` hook is the proper way to use a service in a component.
It simply returns a reference to the service value, that can then be
used by the component later. For example:

``` javascript
import { rpc } from "@web/core/network/rpc";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  setup() {
    onWillStart(async () => {
      const result = await rpc(...);
    })
  }
}
```

### Cookie service {#frontend/services/cookie}

#### Overview

- Technical name: [cookie]{.title-ref}
- Dependencies: none

Provides a way to manipulate cookies. For example:

``` javascript
cookieService.setCookie("hello", "odoo");
```

#### API

> Object representing each cookie and its value if any (or empty string)

> 
>
> param string name
> :   the name of the cookie that should be set
>
> param any value
> :   optional. If given, the cookie will be set to that value
>
> param number ttl
> :   optional. the time in seconds before the cookie will be deleted
>     (default=1 year)
>
> Sets the cookie [name]{.title-ref} to the value [value]{.title-ref}
> with a max age of [ttl]{.title-ref}

> 
>
> param string name
> :   name of the cookie
>
> Deletes the cookie [name]{.title-ref}.

### Effect service {#frontend/services/effect}

#### Overview

- Technical name: [effect]{.title-ref}
- Dependencies: None

Effects are graphical elements that can be temporarily displayed on top
of the page, usually to provide feedback to the user that something
interesting happened.

A good example would be the rainbow man:

![The rainbow man effect](services/rainbow_man.png){.align-center
width="600px"}

Here\'s how this can be displayed:

``` javascript
const effectService = useService("effect");
effectService.add({
  type: "rainbow_man", // can be omitted, default type is already "rainbow_man"
  message: "Boom! Team record for the past 30 days.",
});
```

#### API

> 
>
> param object options
> :   the options for the effect. They will get passed along to the
>     underlying effect component.
>
> Display an effect.

The options are defined by:

``` ts
interface EffectOptions {
  // The name of the desired effect
  type?: string;
  [paramName: string]: any;
}
```

#### Available effects

Currently, the only effect is the rainbow man.

##### RainbowMan

``` javascript
effectService.add({ type: "rainbow_man" });
```

#### How to add an effect

::: {#frontend/services/effect_registry}
The effects are stored in a registry called [effects]{.title-ref}. You
can add new effects by providing a name and a function.
:::

``` javascript
const effectRegistry = registry.category("effects");
effectRegistry.add("rainbow_man", rainbowManEffectFunction);
```

The function must follow this API:

> 
>
> param Env env
> :   the environment received by the service
>
> param object params
> :   the params received from the add function on the service.
>
> returns
> :   [({Component, props} \| void)]{.title-ref} A component and its
>     props or nothing.

This function must create a component and return it. This component is
mounted inside the effect component container.

#### Example

Let\'s say we want to add an effect that add a sepia look at the page.

``` javascript
import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";
import { Component, xml } from "@odoo/owl";

class SepiaEffect extends Component {
  static template = xml`
    <div style="
        position: absolute;
        left: 0;
        top: 0;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        pointer-events: none;
        background: rgba(124,87,0, 0.4);
    "></div>
  `;
}

export function sepiaEffectProvider(env, params = {}) {
    return {
        Component: SepiaEffect,
    };
}

const effectRegistry = registry.category("effects");
effectRegistry.add("sepia", sepiaEffectProvider);
```

And then, call it somewhere you want and you will see the result. Here,
it is called in webclient.js to make it visible everywhere for the
example.

``` javascript
const effectService = useService("effect");
effectService.add({ type: "sepia" });
```

### Http Service {#frontend/services/http}

#### Overview

- Technical name: [http]{.title-ref}
- Dependencies: None

While most interactions between the client and the server in odoo are
[RPCs]{.title-ref} ([XMLHTTPRequest]{.title-ref}), lower level control
on requests may sometimes be required.

This service provides a way to send [get]{.title-ref} and
[post]{.title-ref} [http
requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).

#### API

> 
>
> param string route
> :   the url to send the request to
>
> param string readMethod
> :   the response content type. Can be \"text\", \"json\",
>     \"formData\", \"blob\", \"arrayBuffer\".
>
> returns
> :   the result of the request with the format defined by the
>     readMethod argument.
>
> Sends a get request.

> 
>
> param string route
> :   the url to send the request to
>
> param object params
> :   key value data to be set in the form data part of the request
>
> param string readMethod
> :   the response content type. Can be \"text\", \"json\",
>     \"formData\", \"blob\", \"arrayBuffer\".
>
> returns
> :   the result of the request with the format defined by the
>     readMethod argument.
>
> Sends a post request.

#### Example

``` javascript
const httpService = useService("http");
const data = await httpService.get("https://something.com/posts/1");
// ...
await httpService.post("https://something.com/posts/1", { title: "new title", content: "new content" });
```

### Notification service {#frontend/services/notification}

#### Overview

- Technical name: [notification]{.title-ref}
- Dependencies: None

The [notification]{.title-ref} service allows to display notifications
on the screen.

``` javascript
const notificationService = useService("notification");
notificationService.add("I'm a very simple notification");
```

#### API

> 
>
> param string message
> :   the notification message to display
>
> param object options
> :   the options of the notification
>
> returns
> :   a function to close the notification

#### Examples

A notification for when a sale deal is made with a button to go some
kind of commission page.

``` javascript
// in setup
this.notificationService = useService("notification");
this.actionService = useService("action");

// later
this.notificationService.add("You closed a deal!", {
  title: "Congrats",
  type: "success",
  buttons: [
      {
          name: "See your Commission",
          onClick: () => {
              this.actionService.doAction("commission_action");
          },
      },
  ],
});
```

![Example of notification](services/notification_service.png){.align-center
width="600px"}

A notification that closes after a second:

``` javascript
const notificationService = useService("notification");
const close = notificationService.add("I will be quickly closed");
setTimeout(close, 1000);
```

### Router Service {#frontend/services/router}

#### Overview

- Technical name: [router]{.title-ref}
- Dependencies: none

The [router]{.title-ref} service provides three features:

- information about the current route
- a way for the application to update the url, depending on its state
- listens to every hash change, and notifies the rest of the application

#### API

For example:

``` javascript
// url = /web?debug=assets#action=123&owl&menu_id=174
const { pathname, search, hash } = env.services.router.current;
console.log(pathname); //   /web
console.log(search); //   { debug="assets" }
console.log(hash); //   { action:123, owl: "", menu_id: 174 }
```

Updating the URL is done with the [pushState]{.title-ref} method:

> 
>
> param Object hash
> :   object containing a mapping from some keys to some values
>
> param boolean replace
> :   if true, the url will be replaced, otherwise only key/value pairs
>     from the [hash]{.title-ref} will be updated.
>
> Updates the URL with each key/value pair from the [hash]{.title-ref}
> object. If a value is set to an empty string, the key is added to the
> url without any corresponding value.
>
> If true, the [replace]{.title-ref} argument tells the router that the
> url hash should be completely replaced (so values not present in the
> [hash]{.title-ref} object will be removed).
>
> This method call does not reload the page. It also does not trigger a
> [hashchange]{.title-ref} event, nor a [ROUTE_CHANGE]{.title-ref} in
> the `main bus <frontend/framework/bus>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
> This is because this method is intended to only updates the url. The
> code calling this method has the responsibility to make sure that the
> screen is updated as well.

For example:

``` javascript
// url = /web#action_id=123
routerService.pushState({ menu_id: 321 });
// url is now /web#action_id=123&menu_id=321
routerService.pushState({ yipyip: "" }, replace: true);
// url is now /web#yipyip
```

Finally, the [redirect]{.title-ref} method will redirect the browser to
a specified url:

> 
>
> param string url
> :   a valid url
>
> param boolean wait
> :   if true, wait for the server to be ready, and redirect after
>
> Redirect the browser to [url]{.title-ref}. This method reloads the
> page. The [wait]{.title-ref} argument is rarely used: it is useful in
> some cases where we know that the server will be unavailable for a
> short duration, typically just after an addon update or install
> operation.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The router service emits a [ROUTE_CHANGE]{.title-ref} event on the
`main bus <frontend/framework/bus>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
whenever the current route has changed.
::::

### RPC service {#frontend/services/rpc}

#### Overview

- Technical name: [rpc]{.title-ref}
- Dependencies: none

The [rpc]{.title-ref} service provides a single asynchronous function to
send requests to the server. Calling a controller is very simple: the
route should be the first argument and optionally, a `params` object can
be given as a second argument.

``` javascript
import { rpc } from "@web/core/network/rpc";

 // somewhere else, in an async function:
 const result = await rpc("/my/route", { some: "value" });
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Note that the `rpc` service is considered a low-level service. It should
only be used to interact with Odoo controllers. To work with models
(which is by far the most important usecase), one should use the `orm`
service instead.
::::

#### API

> 
>
> param string route
> :   route targeted by the request
>
> param Object params
> :   (optional) parameters sent to the server
>
> param Object settings
> :   (optional) request settings (see below)
>
> The `settings` object can contain:
>
> - `xhr`, which should be a `XMLHTTPRequest` object. In that case, the
>   `rpc` method will simply use it instead of creating a new one. This
>   is useful when one accesses advanced features of the
>   [XMLHTTPRequest]{.title-ref} API.
> - `silent (boolean)` If set to `true`, the web client will not provide
>   a feedback that there is a pending rpc.

The `rpc` service communicates with the server by using a
`XMLHTTPRequest` object, configured to work with the `application/json`
content type. So clearly the content of the request should be JSON
serializable. Each request done by this service uses the `POST` http
method.

Server errors actually return the response with an http code 200. But
the `rpc` service will treat them as error.

#### Error Handling

An rpc can fail for two main reasons:

- either the odoo server returns an error (so, we call this a `server`
  error). In that case the http request will return with an http code
  200 BUT with a response object containing an `error` key.
- or there is some other kind of network error

When a rpc fails, then:

- the promise representing the rpc is rejected, so the calling code will
  crash, unless it handles the situation

- an event `RPC_ERROR` is triggered on the main application bus. The
  event payload contains a description of the cause of the error:

  If it is a server error (the server code threw an exception). In that
  case the event payload will be an object with the following keys:

  - `type = 'server'`
  - `message(string)`
  - `code(number)`
  - `name(string)` (optional, used by the error service to look for an
    appropriate dialog to use when handling the error)
  - `subType(string)` (optional, often used to determine the dialog
    title)
  - `data(object)` (optional object that can contain various keys among
    which `debug` : the main debug information, with the call stack)

  If it is a network error, then the error description is simply an
  object `{type: 'network'}`. When a network error occurs, a
  `notification <frontend/services/notification>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} is displayed and the server is regularly contacted until
  it responds. The notification is closed as soon as the server
  responds.

### Scroller service {#frontend/services/scroller}

#### Overview

- Technical name: [scroller]{.title-ref}
- Dependencies: none

Whenever the user clicks on an anchor in the web client, this service
automatically scrolls to the target (if appropriate).

The service adds an event listener to get [click]{.title-ref}\'s on the
document. The service checks if the selector contained in its href
attribute is valid to distinguish anchors and Odoo actions (e.g. [\<a
href=\"#target_element\"\>\</a\>]{.title-ref}). It does nothing if it is
not the case.

An event [SCROLLER:ANCHOR_LINK_CLICKED]{.title-ref} is triggered on the
main application bus if the click seems to be targeted at an element.
The event contains a custom event containing the [element]{.title-ref}
matching and its [id]{.title-ref} as a reference. It may allow other
parts to handle a behavior relative to anchors themselves. The original
event is also given as it might need to be prevented. If the event is
not prevented, then the user interface will scroll to the target
element.

#### API

The following values are contained in the
[anchor-link-clicked]{.title-ref} custom event explained above.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Name                       Type                   Description
  -------------------------- ---------------------- -----------------------------------
  [element]{.title-ref}      [HTMLElement \|        The anchor element targeted by the
                             null]{.title-ref}      href

  [id]{.title-ref}           [string]{.title-ref}   The id contained in the href

  [originalEv]{.title-ref}   [Event]{.title-ref}    The original click event
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The scroller service emits a [SCROLLER:ANCHOR_LINK_CLICKED]{.title-ref}
event on the `main bus <frontend/framework/bus>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. To avoid the default scroll behavior of the scroller
service, you must use [preventDefault()]{.title-ref} on the event given
to the listener so that you can implement your own behavior correctly
from the listener.
::::

### Title Service {#frontend/services/title}

#### Overview

- Technical name: [title]{.title-ref}
- Dependencies: none

The [title]{.title-ref} service offers a simple API that allows to
read/modify the document title. For example, if the current document
title is \"Odoo\", we can change it to \"Odoo 15 - Apple\" by using the
following command:

``` javascript
// in some component setup method
const titleService = useService("title");

titleService.setParts({ odoo: "Odoo 15", fruit: "Apple" });
```

#### API

The `title` service manipulates the following interface:

``` ts
interface Parts {
    [key: string]: string | null;
}
```

Each key represents the identity of a part of the title, and each value
is the string that is displayed, or [null]{.title-ref} if it has been
removed.

Its API is:

> 
>
> returns
> :   Parts the current [Parts]{.title-ref} object maintained by the
>     title service

> 
>
> param Parts parts
> :   object representing the required change
>
> The `setParts` method allows to add/replace/delete several parts of
> the title. Delete a part (a value) is done by setting the associated
> key value to [null]{.title-ref}.
>
> Note that one can only modify a single part without affecting the
> other parts. For example, if the title is composed of the following
> parts:
>
> ``` javascript
> { odoo: "Odoo", action: "Import" }
> ```
>
> with `current` value being `Odoo - Import` , then
>
> ``` javascript
> setParts({
>   action: null,
> });
> ```
>
> will change the title to `Odoo`.

### User service {#frontend/services/user}

#### Overview

- Technical name: [user]{.title-ref}
- Dependencies: [rpc]{.title-ref}

The [user]{.title-ref} service provides a bunch of data and a few helper
functions concerning the connected user.

#### API

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Name               Type                 Description
  ------------------ -------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------
  `context`          `Object`             The

  `isSystem`         `boolean`            Whether the user is part of the system group
                                          ([base.group_system]{.title-ref})

`HOOT (Hierarchically Organized Odoo Tests)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is a testing framework written with Owl whose key features
are:

- to register and run tests and test suites;
- to display an intuitive interface to view and filter test results;
- to provide ways to interact with the DOM to simulate user actions;
- to provide low-level helpers allowing to mock various global objects.

As such, it has been integrated as a `lib/`{.interpreted-text
role="file"} in the Odoo codebase and exports 2 main modules:

- `@odoo/hoot-dom`{.interpreted-text role="file"}: (can be used in
  tours) helpers to:

  > - **interact** with the DOM, such as `click`{.interpreted-text
  >   role="js:meth"} and `press`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"};
  > - **query** elements from the DOM, such as
  >   `queryAll`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"} and
  >   `waitFor`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"};

- `@odoo/hoot`{.interpreted-text role="file"}: (only to be used in unit
  tests) all the test framework features:

  > - [test]{.title-ref}, [describe]{.title-ref} and
  >   [expect]{.title-ref}
  > - test hooks like [after]{.title-ref} and [afterEach]{.title-ref}
  > - fixture handling with [getFixture]{.title-ref}
  > - date and time handling like [mockDate]{.title-ref} or
  >   [advanceTime]{.title-ref}
  > - mocking network responses through `mockFetch`{.interpreted-text
  >   role="js:meth"} or `mockWebSocket`{.interpreted-text
  >   role="js:meth"}
  > - every helper exported by `@odoo/hoot-dom`{.interpreted-text
  >   role="file"}

Note
:::

This section of the documentation is not meant to list *all* helpers
available in Hoot (the full list can be found in the
[\@odoo/hoot]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/lib/hoot/hoot.js) module
itself). The goal here is to showcase the most used helpers and to
justify some of the decisions that have led to the current shape of the
testing framework.
::::

## Running tests

In Odoo, frontend unit tests can be run by going to the
[/web/tests]{.title-ref} URL. Most of the setup for calling the test
runner is already in place:

- the [web.assets_unit_tests]{.title-ref} bundle is already defined, and
  picks up all tests defined in most addons;
- a `start.hoot.js`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file takes care of
  calling the test runner with its exported [start]{.title-ref} entry
  point function.

When going to the test page, tests will be run sequentially and the
results will be displayed in the console and in the GUI (if not running
in [headless]{.title-ref} mode).

### Runner options

The runner can be configured either:

- through the interface (with the configuration dropdown and the search
  bar);
- or through the URL query parameters (e.g. [?headless]{.title-ref} to
  run in headless mode).

Here is the list of available options for the runner:

- 

  [bail]{.title-ref}

  :   Amount of failed tests after which the test runner will be
      stopped. A falsy value (including 0) means that the runner should
      never be aborted. (default: [0]{.title-ref})

- 

  [debugTest]{.title-ref}

  :   Same as the [FILTER_SCHEMA.test]{.title-ref} filter, while also
      putting the test runner in \"debug\" mode. See
      [TestRunner.debug]{.title-ref} for more info. (default:
      [false]{.title-ref})

- 

  [fps]{.title-ref}

  :   Sets the value of frames per seconds (this will be transformed to
      milliseconds and used in [advanceFrame]{.title-ref})

- 

  [filter]{.title-ref}

  :   Search string that will filter matching tests/suites, based on
      their full name (including their parent suite(s)) and their tags.
      (default: [\"\"]{.title-ref})

- 

  [frameRate]{.title-ref}

  :   *Estimated* amount of frames rendered per second, used when
      mocking animation frames. (default: [60]{.title-ref} fps)

- 

  [fun]{.title-ref}

  :   Lightens the mood. (default: [false]{.title-ref})

- 

  [headless]{.title-ref}

  :   Whether to render the test runner user interface. (default:
      [false]{.title-ref})

- 

  [id]{.title-ref}

  :   IDs of the suites OR tests to run exclusively. The ID of a job is
      generated deterministically based on its full name.

- 

  [loglevel]{.title-ref}

  :   Log level used by the test runner. The higher the level, the more
      logs will be displayed:

      - \`0\`: only runner logs are displayed (default)
      - \`1\`: all suite results are also logged
      - \`2\`: all test results are also logged
      - \`3\`: debug information for each test is also logged

- 

  [manual]{.title-ref}

  :   Whether the test runner must be manually started after page load
      (defaults to starting automatically). (default:
      [false]{.title-ref})

- 

  [notrycatch]{.title-ref}

  :   Removes the safety of [try .. catch]{.title-ref} statements around
      each test\'s run function to let errors bubble to the browser.
      (default: [false]{.title-ref})

- 

  [order]{.title-ref}

  :   Determines the order of test execution:

      - \`\"fifo\"\`: tests will be run sequentially as declared in the
        file system;
      - \`\"lifo\"\`: tests will be run sequentially in the reverse
        order;
      - \`\"random\"\`: shuffles tests and suites within their parent
        suite.

- 

  [preset]{.title-ref}

  :   Environment in which the test runner is running. This parameter is
      used to determine the default value of other features, namely:

      - the user agent;
      - touch support;
      - expected size of the viewport.

- 

  [showdetail]{.title-ref}

  :   Determines how the failed tests must be unfolded in the UI.
      (default: [\"first-fail\"]{.title-ref})

- 

  [tag]{.title-ref}

  :   Tag names of tests and suites to run exclusively (case
      insensitive). (default: empty)

- 

  [timeout]{.title-ref}

  :   Duration (in milliseconds) at the end of which a test will
      automatically fail. (default: [5]{.title-ref} seconds)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When selecting tests and suites to run, an implicit [OR]{.title-ref} is
applied between the *including* filters. This means that adding more
inclusive filters will result in more tests being run. This applies to
the [filter]{.title-ref}, [id]{.title-ref} and [tag]{.title-ref} filters
(*excluding* filters however will remove matching tests from the list of
tests to run).
::::

## Writing tests

### Test

Writing a test can be very straightforward, as it is just a matter of
calling the [test]{.title-ref} function with a name and a function that
will contain the test logic.

Here is a simple example:

``` javascript
import { expect, test } from "@odoo/hoot";

test("My first test", () => {
    expect(2 + 2).toBe(4);
});
```

### Describe

Most of the time, tests are not that simple. They often require some
setup and teardown, and sometimes they need to be grouped together in a
suite. This is where the [describe]{.title-ref} function comes into
play.

Here is how you would declare a suite and a test within it:

``` javascript
import { describe, expect, test } from "@odoo/hoot";

describe("My first suite", () => {
    test("My first test", () => {
        expect(2 + 2).toBe(4);
    });
});
```

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

In Odoo, all test files are run in an isolated environment and are
wrapped within a global [describe]{.title-ref} block (with the name of
the suite being the *path* of the test file).

With that in mind you should not need to declare a suite in your test
files, although you can still declare sub-suites in the same file if you
still want to split the file\'s suite, for organization or tagging
purposes.
::::

## Expect

The [expect]{.title-ref} function is the main assertion function of the
framework. It is used to assert that a value or an object is what it is
expected to be or in the state it is supposed to be. To do so, it
provides a few modifiers and a wide range of matchers.

### Modifiers

An [expect]{.title-ref} modifier is a getter that returns another set of
*altered* matchers that will behave in a specific way.

- 

  [not]{.title-ref}

  :   Inverts the result of the following matcher: it will succeed if
      the matcher fails.

      ``` javascript
      expect(true).not.toBe(false);
      ```

- 

  [resolves]{.title-ref}

  :   Waits for the value ([Promise]{.title-ref}) to be *\"resolved\"*
      before running the following matcher with the resolved value.

      ``` javascript
      await expect(Promise.resolve(42)).resolves.toBe(42);
      ```

- 

  [rejects]{.title-ref}

  :   Waits for the value ([Promise]{.title-ref}) to be *\"rejected\"*
      before running the following matcher with the rejected reason.

      ``` javascript
      await expect(Promise.reject("error")).rejects.toBe("error");
      ```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The [resolves]{.title-ref} and [rejects]{.title-ref} modifiers are only
available when the value is a promise, and will return a promise that
will resolve once the assertion is done.
::::

### Regular matchers

The matchers dictate what to do on the value being tested. Some will
take that value as-is, while others will *transform* that value before
performing the assertion on it (i.e. DOM matchers).

Note that the last argument parameter of all matchers is an optional
dictionary with additional options, in which a custom assertion
[message]{.title-ref} can be given for added context/specificity.

The first list of matchers are primitive or object based and are the
most common ones:

> [expected]{.title-ref} value.

### DOM matchers

This next list of matchers are node-based and are used to assert the
state of a node or a list of nodes. They generally take a
`custom selector <hoot/custom-dom-selectors>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} as the argument of the [expect]{.title-ref} function
(although a [Node]{.title-ref} or an iterable of [Node]{.title-ref} is
also accepted).

### Static methods

The [expect]{.title-ref} helper function also contains static methods
that can be used to run through a detached testing flow that isn\'t
bound to one specific value at a certain moment.

These methods are mainly used to register steps or errors in the scope
of the current test, and to evaluate them later on.

## DOM: queries

### Custom DOM selectors {#hoot/custom-dom-selectors}

Here\'s a brief section on DOM selectors in Hoot, as they support
additional pseudo-classes that can be used to target elements based on
non-standard features, such as their text content or their global
position in the document.

- 

  [:contains(text)]{.title-ref}

  :   matches nodes whose text content matches the given
      [text]{.title-ref}

      - given *text* supports regular expression syntax (e.g.
        [:contains(/\^foo.+/)]{.title-ref}) and is case-insensitive
        (unless using the [i]{.title-ref} flag at the end of the regex)

- 

  [:displayed]{.title-ref}

  :   matches nodes that are *\"displayed\"* (see
      [isDisplayed]{.title-ref})

- 

  [:empty]{.title-ref}

  :   matches nodes that have an empty content (value or text content)

- 

  [:eq(n)]{.title-ref}

  :   returns the *nth* node based on its global position (0-based
      index);

- 

  [:first]{.title-ref}

  :   returns the first node matching the selector (in the whole
      document)

- 

  [:focusable]{.title-ref}

  :   matches nodes that can be *\"focused\"* (see
      [isFocusable]{.title-ref})

- 

  [:hidden]{.title-ref}

  :   matches nodes that are *not* *\"visible\"* (see
      [isVisible]{.title-ref})

- 

  [:iframe]{.title-ref}

  :   matches nodes that are [\<iframe\>]{.title-ref} elements, and
      returns their [body]{.title-ref} if it is ready

- 

  [:last]{.title-ref}

  :   returns the last node matching the selector (in the whole
      document)

- 

  [:selected]{.title-ref}

  :   matches nodes that are selected (e.g. [\<option\>]{.title-ref}
      elements)

- 

  [:shadow]{.title-ref}

  :   matches nodes that have shadow roots, and returns their shadow
      root

- 

  [:scrollable]{.title-ref}

  :   matches nodes that are scrollable (see [isScrollable]{.title-ref})

- 

  [:value(text)]{.title-ref}

  :   matches nodes whose value matches the given [text]{.title-ref}

      - given *text* supports regular expression syntax (e.g.
        [:value(/\^foo.+/)]{.title-ref}) and is case-insensitive (unless
        using the [i]{.title-ref} flag at the end of the regex)

- 

  [:visible]{.title-ref}

  :   matches nodes that are *\"visible\"* (see [isVisible]{.title-ref})

### Query & node properties helpers

Hoot provides helpers to query nodes and some of their properties in a
streamlined and elegant way. This can mainly be done through the use of
[queryX]{.title-ref} helpers:

> Returns a list of nodes matching the given [Target]{.title-ref}. This
> function can either be used as a [template literal
> tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates)
> (only supports string selector without options) or invoked the usual
> way.
>
> The target can be:
>
> > - a [Node]{.title-ref} (or an iterable of nodes), or
> >   [Window]{.title-ref} object;
> > - a [Document]{.title-ref} object (which will be converted to its
> >   body);
> > - a string representing a
> >   `custom selector <hoot/custom-dom-selectors>`{.interpreted-text
> >   role="ref"} (which will be queried from the [root]{.title-ref}
> >   option).
>
> An [options]{.title-ref} object can be specified to filter[^1] the
> results:
>
> > - \`count\`: the exact number of nodes to match (throws an error if
> >   the number of nodes doesn\'t match);
> > - \`displayed\`: whether the nodes must be \"displayed\" (see
> >   [isDisplayed]{.title-ref});
> > - \`focusable\`: whether the nodes must be \"focusable\" (see
> >   [isFocusable]{.title-ref});
> > - \`root\`: the root node to query the selector in (defaults to the
> >   current fixture);
> > - \`visible\`: whether the nodes must be \"visible\" (see
> >   [isVisible]{.title-ref}).
> >   - This option implies [displayed]{.title-ref}
>
> returns
> :   [Node\[\]]{.title-ref}

> Performs a `queryAll`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"} on the given
> [target]{.title-ref} and returns a list of attribute values.
>
> returns
> :   [string\[\]]{.title-ref} list of attribute values

> Performs a `queryAll`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"} on the given
> [target]{.title-ref} and returns a list of property values.
>
> returns
> :   [unknown\[\]]{.title-ref} list of property values

> Performs a `queryAll`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"} on the given
> [target]{.title-ref} and returns a list of text contents.
>
> returns
> :   [string\[\]]{.title-ref} list of text contents

> Performs a `queryAll`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"} on the given
> [target]{.title-ref} and returns a list of values.
>
> returns
> :   [string\[\]]{.title-ref} a list of values

> Performs a `queryOne`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"} with the given
> arguments and returns the value of the given [attribute]{.title-ref}
> of the matching node.
>
> returns
> :   [string]{.title-ref} the attribute value

> Performs a `queryAll`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"} with the given
> arguments and returns the first result or [null]{.title-ref}.
>
> returns
> :   [Node]{.title-ref} \| [null]{.title-ref} the first matching node

> Performs a `queryAll`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"} with the given
> arguments, along with a forced [count: 1]{.title-ref} option to ensure
> only one node matches the given [Target]{.title-ref}.
>
> The returned value is a single node instead of a list of nodes.
>
> returns
> :   [Node]{.title-ref} a single node

> Performs a `queryOne`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"} with the given
> arguments and returns the *text* of the matching node.
>
> returns
> :   [string]{.title-ref} text of the matching node

> Performs a `queryOne`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"} with the given
> arguments and returns the *value* of the matching node.
>
> returns
> :   [string]{.title-ref} value of the matching node

All of the above helpers are synchronous, meaning that they will attempt
to query nodes instantly. Although some use cases require the element to
be awaited for an arbitrary amount of time, unknown in advance due to UI
fetching and rendering complexity.

Hoot provides 2 methods to wait for an element to appear / disappear
within a certain time frame (by default: [200]{.title-ref} milliseconds)
for such cases:

> Combination of `queryAll`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"} and
> `waitUntil`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"}: waits for a given
> target to match elements in the DOM and returns the first matching
> node when it appears (or immediately if it is already present).
>
> returns
> :   [Promise\<Node\>]{.title-ref} containing the first matching node

> Opposite of `waitFor`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"} waits for a
> given target to disappear from the DOM.
>
> returns
> :   [Promise\<number\>]{.title-ref} containing the number of matching
>     nodes

## DOM: interaction helpers

Along with querying elements, it is often required to interact with
them. As such, Hoot provides helpers to simulate various user
interactions on elements.

These can be split into 2 types based on their parameters:
**pointer-based** interaction helpers, and the **other** ones.

### Pointer interaction helpers:

Pointer interaction helpers (such as `click`{.interpreted-text
role="js:meth"} or `drag`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"}) will
simulate actual pointer movements and events on the given target, and on
any previous element the pointer was *supposed* to have been.

> Ensures that the given [Target]{.title-ref} is checked.
>
> If it is not checked, a `click`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"} is
> simulated on the input. If the input is still not checked after the
> click, an error is thrown.
>
> returns
> :   [Promise\<Event\[\]\>]{.title-ref}
>
> ``` javascript
> check("input[type=checkbox]"); // Checks the first <input> checkbox element
> ```

> Performs a click sequence on the given [Target]{.title-ref}.
>
> The event sequence is as follows:
>
> > - [pointerdown]{.title-ref}
> > - \[desktop\] [mousedown]{.title-ref}
> > - \[touch\] [touchstart]{.title-ref}
> > - \[target is not active element\] [blur]{.title-ref}
> > - \[target is focusable\] [focus]{.title-ref}
> > - [pointerup]{.title-ref}
> > - \[desktop\] [mouseup]{.title-ref}
> > - \[touch\] [touchend]{.title-ref}
> > - [click]{.title-ref}
> > - [dblclick]{.title-ref} if click is not prevented & current click
> >   count is even
>
> returns
> :   [Promise\<Event\[\]\>]{.title-ref}
>
> ``` javascript
> click("button"); // Clicks on the first <button> element
> ```

> Performs two `click`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"} sequences on
> the given [Target]{.title-ref}.
>
> returns
> :   [Promise\<Event\[\]\>]{.title-ref}
>
> ``` javascript
> dblclick("button"); // Double-clicks on the first <button> element
> ```

> Starts a drag sequence on the given [Target]{.title-ref}.
>
> Returns a set of helper functions to direct the sequence:
>
> > - \`moveTo\`: moves the pointer to the given target;
> > - \`drop\`: drops the dragged element on the given target (if any);
> > - \`cancel\`: cancels the drag sequence.
>
> returns
> :   [Promise\<DragHelpers\>]{.title-ref}
>
> ``` javascript
> drag(".card:first").drop(".card:last"); // Drags the first card onto the last one
>
> drag(".card:first").moveTo(".card:last").drop(); // Same as above
>
> const { cancel, moveTo } = await drag(".card:first"); // Starts the drag sequence
> moveTo(".card:eq(3)"); // Moves the dragged card to the 4th card
> cancel(); // Cancels the drag sequence
> ```

> Performs a hover sequence on the given [Target]{.title-ref}.
>
> The event sequence is as follows:
>
> > - [pointerover]{.title-ref}
> > - \[desktop\] [mouseover]{.title-ref}
> > - [pointerenter]{.title-ref}
> > - \[desktop\] [mouseenter]{.title-ref}
> > - [pointermove]{.title-ref}
> > - \[desktop\] [mousemove]{.title-ref}
> > - \[touch\] [touchmove]{.title-ref}
>
> returns
> :   [Promise\<Event\[\]\>]{.title-ref}
>
> ``` javascript
> hover("button"); // Hovers the first <button> element
> ```

> Performs a pointer down on the given [Target]{.title-ref}.
>
> The event sequence is as follows:
>
> > - [pointerdown]{.title-ref}
> > - \[desktop\] [mousedown]{.title-ref}
> > - \[touch\] [touchstart]{.title-ref}
> > - \[target is not active element\] [blur]{.title-ref}
> > - \[target is focusable\] [focus]{.title-ref}
>
> returns
> :   [Promise\<Event\[\]\>]{.title-ref}
>
> ``` javascript
> pointerDown("button"); // Focuses to the first <button> element
> ```

> Performs a pointer up on the given [Target]{.title-ref}.
>
> The event sequence is as follows:
>
> > - [pointerup]{.title-ref}
> > - \[desktop\] [mouseup]{.title-ref}
> > - \[touch\] [touchend]{.title-ref}
>
> returns
> :   [Promise\<Event\[\]\>]{.title-ref}
>
> ``` javascript
> pointerUp("body"); // Triggers a pointer up on the <body> element
> ```

> Performs a scroll event sequence on the given [Target]{.title-ref}.
>
> The event sequence is as follows:
>
> > - \[desktop\] [wheel]{.title-ref}
> > - [scroll]{.title-ref}
>
> returns
> :   [Promise\<Event\[\]\>]{.title-ref}
>
> ``` javascript
> scroll("body", { y: 0 }); // Scrolls to the top of <body>
> ```

> Sets the given value to the current \"input\[type=range\]\"
> [Target]{.title-ref}.
>
> The event sequence is as follows:
>
> > - [pointerdown]{.title-ref}
> > - [input]{.title-ref}
> > - [change]{.title-ref}
> > - [pointerup]{.title-ref}
>
> returns
> :   [Promise\<Event\[\]\>]{.title-ref}

> Ensures that the given [Target]{.title-ref} is unchecked.
>
> If it is checked, a `click`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"} is
> triggered on the input. If the input is still checked after the click,
> an error is thrown.
>
> returns
> :   [Promise\<Event\[\]\>]{.title-ref}
>
> ``` javascript
> uncheck("input[type=checkbox]"); // Unchecks the first <input> checkbox element
> ```

### Other interaction helpers:

Other interaction helpers will not have a [target]{.title-ref}
parameter. It is not needed, since pressing keys on a keyboard (for
example) is done on the current *active element*.

> Clears the value of the current *active element*.
>
> This is done using the following sequence:
>
> > - pressing [\"Control\"]{.title-ref} & [\"A\"]{.title-ref} to select
> >   the whole value;
> > - pressing [\"Backspace\"]{.title-ref} to delete the value;
> > - (optional) triggering a [\"change\"]{.title-ref} event by pressing
> >   [\"Enter\"]{.title-ref}.
>
> returns
> :   [Promise\<Event\[\]\>]{.title-ref}
>
> ``` javascript
> clear(); // Clears the value of the current active element
> ```

> Combination of `clear`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"} and
> `fill`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"}:
>
> > - first, clears the input value (if any)
> > - then fills the input with the given value
>
> returns
> :   [Promise\<Event\[\]\>]{.title-ref}
>
> ``` javascript
> fill("foo"); // Types "foo" in the active element
> edit("Hello World"); // Replaces "foo" by "Hello World"
> ```

> Fills the current *active element* with the given [value]{.title-ref}.
> This helper is intended for [\<input\>]{.title-ref} and
> [\<textarea\>]{.title-ref} elements, with the exception of
> [\"checkbox\"]{.title-ref} and [\"radio\"]{.title-ref} types, which
> should be selected using the [check]{.title-ref} helper.
>
> If the target is an editable input, its string [value]{.title-ref}

## Mocks

By default, a lot of low-level features are mocked by Hoot:
[clipboard]{.title-ref}, [fetch]{.title-ref},
[localStorage]{.title-ref}, etc. These mocks are intended to not produce
any side-effect that would disturb the test runner or the context of
other tests, while still providing the same interface to allow tests to
rely on these features seamlessly.

There is also a need (most of the time) to force actions on these
features or change their behavior for a test, so there exist helpers to
interact with these mocked features. The following sections will list
the main mocked features and the means to interact with them.

### Time

Most asynchronous features are mocked: \"timers\"
([setTimeout]{.title-ref}, [setInterval]{.title-ref} and
[requestAnimationFrame]{.title-ref}), [Date]{.title-ref} and
[performance]{.title-ref} all behave normally, but can be canceled or
sped-up manually to considerably shorten the actual duration of tests.
For example: all \"timers\" are canceled at the end of each test to
avoid side-effects for the next one.

### Network

In general, we don\'t want to perform actual network calls in tests. To
ensure this, all calls to [fetch]{.title-ref} and
[XMLHttpRequest]{.title-ref} have been re-routed to a function given to
`mockFetch`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In Odoo, this is generally implicitly handled by a
`MockServer <mock-server/configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
which is spawned by the mock environment, i.e. any time a component is
rendered using the
`mountWithCleanup <web-test-helpers/components>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} helper.

### Notable global features

The following features may not have any specific mocked feature added,
but they do work as expected without changing the actual properties they
were meant to:

- [Location](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location)

# Mock server

## Rationale

Test cases can range in complexity; from testing the return value of a
simple helper function, to rendering an entire webclient to simulate
interactions across several components/services.

In the latter cases, many interactions will trigger server requests,
without which the components or features will stop functioning properly.
However, it is important that these requests *do not* land on the actual
server, as they could affect the database, which is definitely not
something a test should be doing.

To overcome this, each request should be intercepted and replaced by a
function emulating actual server responses with test (i.e. fake) data.

Since some of these requests are very common (e.g. ORM calls, such as
[web_search_read]{.title-ref} or [web_save]{.title-ref}, or other
methods such as [get_views]{.title-ref}), a mock server has been
implemented by default for every test that spawns an
`env (Odoo environment)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}[^1].

These mock servers act independently for each test, can be configured
separately, and provide out of the box helpers for the most used routes
in Odoo.

## Overview

A mock server is actually quite simple in itself: it is an object
containing a *collection* of all defined mock models, and a *mapping*
between routes and callbacks returning the test data.

The mock models themselves hold most of the CRUD logic, as well as the
data used to simulate server records.

Once a mock server starts, it hijacks *all* server requests, and for
each of them it will check in its *mapping* whether one of its
registered routes matches the requested URL. The most notable example of
its pre-defined routes is [/web/dataset/call_kw]{.title-ref}, which is
responsible for calling an ORM method on the appropriate mock model.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Like most test helpers not provided by Hoot, mock server-related helpers
and classes can be found in the
[\"@web/../tests/web_test_helpers\"]{.title-ref} module.
::::

## Configuration {#mock-server/configuration}

By default, a mock server is *\"empty\"*, meaning that it has no defined
mock model.

This does not mean that it is useless though, as it will already handle
a few pre-defined routes, such as the ones responsible for fetching
[menus]{.title-ref} and [translations]{.title-ref}, which are spawned by
`services <../services>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} as soon as an
[env]{.title-ref} is spawned.

But this means that ORM methods will fail, as the model that they target
has not been defined yet.

To create and define a mock model, you need 2 things:

- a [class]{.title-ref} extending the [models.Model]{.title-ref} class;

  > - special keys prefixed with a [\_]{.title-ref} act as metadata
  >   holders, like in Python (e.g. [\_name]{.title-ref},
  >   [\_order]{.title-ref}, [\_description]{.title-ref}, etc.)[^2][^3];
  > - [\_records]{.title-ref} holds the list of objects representing
  >   fake record data;
  > - [\_views]{.title-ref} can be a mapping of view types and XML
  >   arches;
  > - other [public class
  >   fields](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Public_class_fields)
  >   will be interpreted as fields (by calling the appropriate method
  >   from [fields]{.title-ref});
  > - model-specific methods (such as [has_group]{.title-ref} for
  >   [\"res.users\"]{.title-ref}) can also be defined here.

- calling [defineModels]{.title-ref} with the class defined above.

Here is a basic example of a simple, fake, [\"res.partner\"]{.title-ref}
model:

``` javascript
import { defineModels, fields, models } from "@web/../tests/web_test_helpers";

class ResPartner extends models.Model {
    _name = "res.partner";

    name = fields.Char({ required: true );

    _records = [
        { name: "Mitchel Admin" },
    ];

    _views = {
        form: /* xml */`
            <form>
                <field name="name" />
            </form>
        `,
        list: /* xml */`
            <list>
                <field name="display_name" />
            </list>
        `,
    };
}

defineModels({ ResPartner });
```

This code will make these data available for *all* tests in the current
test file. Of course, defining a class and calling
[defineModels]{.title-ref} can also be done from *within* a given test
to limit the scope of that model to the current test.

Other methods such as [defineMenus]{.title-ref},
[defineActions]{.title-ref} or [defineParams]{.title-ref} can also be
used to configure the current mock server. Most of their API is quite
straightforward (i.e. they receive JSON-like descriptions of menus,
actions, etc.).

### Mock models: requests

Many test cases only require one or a few mock models to work. But
sometimes, it is either too bothersome to implement the mocking logic
within a model, or a *route* (i.e. server request URL) is simply not
associated to a Python model at all.

In such cases, the [onRpc]{.title-ref} method is to be called, to
associate a route or an ORM method to a callback.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Multiple [onRpc]{.title-ref} calls can be associated to the same route /
ORM method; in which case they will be called sequentially from last to
first defined. Returning a *non-null-or-undefined* value will interrupt
the current chain, and return that value as final result of the server
request.
::::

It can be used in 4 different ways:

#### \`onRpc\`: with a route ([\"/\"]{.title-ref})

When the first argument is a [string]{.title-ref} starting with a
[\"/\"]{.title-ref}, the callback is expected to be a *route* callback,
receiving a [Request\_]{.title-ref} object:

``` javascript
onRpc("/route/to/test", async (request) => {
    const { ids }  = await request.json();
    expect.step(ids);
    return {};
});
```

By default, the return value of these callbacks are wrapped within the
[body]{.title-ref} of a mock [Response\_]{.title-ref} object.

This is fine for most use-cases, but sometimes the callback needs to
respond with a [Response\_]{.title-ref} object with custom
[status]{.title-ref} or [headers]{.title-ref}.

In such cases, an *optional* dictionary can be passed as a 3rd argument
to specify whether the callback is to be considered *\"pure\"*, meaning
that its return value should be returned as-is to the server caller:

``` javascript
onRpc(
    "/not/found",
    () => new Response("{}", { status: 404 }),
    { pure: true }
);
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Using *\"pure\"* request callbacks can also be used to return anything
else than a [Response\_]{.title-ref} object, in which case the returned
value will still be wrapped in the body of a mock
[Response\_]{.title-ref} to comply with the [fetch\_]{.title-ref} /
[XMLHttpRequest\_]{.title-ref} APIs.
::::

#### \`onRpc\`: with method name(s)

When the first argument is a [string]{.title-ref} *NOT* starting with a
[\"/\"]{.title-ref} or a list of [strings]{.title-ref}, the callback is
expected to be an ORM callback, only called when the request\'s
[method]{.title-ref} matches the one given as argument.

The callback will receive an object containing:

- the *spread* [params]{.title-ref} value contained in the request body
  (typically: [args]{.title-ref}, [kwargs]{.title-ref},
  [model]{.title-ref} and [method]{.title-ref});
- a [parent()]{.title-ref} function, which when invoked will call the
  defined ORM callback *preceding* this one;
- a [route]{.title-ref} key, containing the [pathname]{.title-ref} of
  the request (typically: [/web/dataset/call_kw]{.title-ref});
- the [request]{.title-ref} object.

``` javascript
onRpc("web_read", async ({ args, parent }) => {
    const result = parent();
    expect.step(args[0]); // Contains the list of IDs
    result.some_meta_data = { foo: "bar" };
    return result;
});
```

#### \`onRpc\`: with model name(s) AND method name(s)

When:

- the first argument is a [string]{.title-ref} *NOT* starting with a
  [\"/\"]{.title-ref} or a list of [strings]{.title-ref};
- the second argument is also a [string]{.title-ref} or a list of
  [strings]{.title-ref};

Then the callback is expected to be an ORM callback, only called when
the request\'s [method]{.title-ref} *AND* [model]{.title-ref} match the
ones given in the arguments.

This works just the same as the above shape, with an added
[model]{.title-ref} filter:

``` javascript
onRpc("web_read", "res.partner", ({ args }) => {
    expect.step(args[0]);
});
```

#### \`onRpc\`: for *every* ORM method/model

When the *only* argument is a callback, it is expected to be an ORM
callback to be called for *every* ORM call:

``` javascript
onRpc(({ method }) => {
    expect.step(method); // Will step every ORM method call on every model
});
```

### Mock models: fields

Model fields can be declared in 2 ways:

- as [public class
  fields](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Public_class_fields);

- under the [\_fields]{.title-ref} special key. For example:

  > ``` javascript
  > test("test view with date fields", async () => {
  >     // `_fields` can be assigned over, or extended directly.
  >     ResPartner._fields.date = fields.Date({ string: "Registration date" });
  > });
  > ```

Field constructors can take a parameters dictionary to dictate their
behaviour. It will be required for some of them, like relational fields,
which need a [relation]{.title-ref} property to work correctly.

There are limits to what can be done with a mock field compared to an
actual Python server field, but expect the most basic properties to be
supported: [readonly]{.title-ref}, [required]{.title-ref},
[string]{.title-ref}, etc.

[compute]{.title-ref} and [related]{.title-ref} do work for the most
basic use-cases, but do not expect them to function reliably as they
would on the actual server.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

There are 4 default fields pre-defined for each created model:
[id]{.title-ref}, [display_name]{.title-ref}, [created_at]{.title-ref}
and [updated_at]{.title-ref}. They match their server-side counterpart
in their behaviour (e.g. [id]{.title-ref} is incremental and
[display_name]{.title-ref} has a [compute]{.title-ref} function similar
to its server counterpart), and can be overridden if needed.
::::

### Mock models: records

Model records are generated based on each object contained in the
[\_records]{.title-ref} special key *when the model is loaded*. They are
validated based on the fields available on the current models; if a
property does not match a field defined on the model, an error is
thrown.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

[\_records]{.title-ref} *cannot* be altered *after* the model has been
loaded, i.e. after the mock server has started. This key is only used to
generate initial records. If records should be added *after* model
creation, do it either form the available components in the UI, or
through direct ORM calls on the mock server instance.
::::

### Mock models: views

Since actual views need an [\"ir.ui.view\"]{.title-ref} model to be
declared, mock models use a simplified *mapping* to provide view arches.

The [\_view]{.title-ref} special key is a dictionary, with its *keys*
being view types, optionally accompanied by a view ID, and its *values*
being the XML arch string representation.

By default, view IDs are [false]{.title-ref}, but can be specified
explicitly with a comma-separated key combining the view type and its
ID:

``` javascript
// Will simulate a list view with no ID (false).
ResPartner._views.list = /* xml */ `
    <list>
        <field name="display_name" />
    </list>
`;

// Will simulate a form view with ID 418.
ResPartner._views["form,418"] = /* xml */ `
    <form>
        <field name="name" />
        <field name="date" />
    </form>
`;
```

## Spawning a mock server {#mock-server/spawning}

Just like in most cases, only one server can be active for a given test.

As mentioned above, creating an [env]{.title-ref} will automatically
deploy a mock server.

This means that all of these methods will *also* create a mock server,
since they do create an \`env\`:

- `makeMockEnv <web-test-helpers/environment>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"};
- `mountWithCleanup <web-test-helpers/components>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} (calling
  `makeMockEnv <web-test-helpers/environment>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"});
- `mountView <web-test-helpers/views>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  (calling
  `mountWithCleanup <web-test-helpers/components>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}).

However, some low-level features may require to spawn a mock server
*without* an environment. For that purpose, a
[makeMockServer]{.title-ref} helper can be called separately to initiate
a mock server.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

[makeMockServer]{.title-ref} should *only* be used by low-level
features, such as testing the [rpc]{.title-ref} function without the
environment. It is not meant to be used as a means to retrieve the
current mock server instance. For that purpose, refer to
`MockServer.current <mock-server/interacting>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It is to be noted that subsequent calls to [makeMockServer]{.title-ref}
after a mock server has been started are simply ignored.
::::

## Interacting with the server {#mock-server/interacting}

While most of the server interactions are expected to be done directly
or indirectly by production code spawned in the test case, it is
sometimes meaningful to bypass the UI and call the mock server directly
(e.g. to simulate that another user, somewhere else, somehow, has
altered the database).

This can be done by retrieving the [MockServer.current]{.title-ref}
static property containing the current mock server instance (only after
initialization):

``` javascript
// Most common ORM methods are provided out of the box by server models,
// and are synchronous. Although, be careful that this will NOT trigger a
// UI re-render, and will ONLY affect the (fake) database.
const ids = MockServer.env["res.partner"].create([
    { name: "foo" },
    { name: "bar" },
]);
```

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

[MockServer.env]{.title-ref} is just a shortcut to
[MockServer.current.env]{.title-ref}.
::::

[^1]: A mock server is needed as soon as an environment is spawned
    because some `services <../services>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
    do send server requests as soon as they start.

[^2]: Only a subset of these special keys will have an actual effect.
    For example, [\_inherit]{.title-ref} will not work as intended,
    prefer standard class extension.

[^3]: These can be altered by each test without thinking about cleaning
    up: any change performed on a special key will be reverted at the
    end of a test.

# Web test helpers

## Overview

After the `"@odoo/hoot" <./hoot>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} module,
the second most-solicited module in test files should be
[\"@web/../tests/web_test_helpers\"]{.title-ref}.

This module contains all the helpers that combine the low-level helpers
provided by Hoot, with all the most common features that are used in
tests in Odoo.

These helpers are many, and this section of the documentation will only
highlight the most common ones, and the way they interact with one
another.

For a full list of available helpers, you may refer to the
[web_test_helpers
file]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/tests/web_test_helpers.js).

## Mock environment {#web-test-helpers/environment}

The [makeMockEnv]{.title-ref} helper is the lowest helper that can spawn
an [env]{.title-ref}.

It will take care of

- creating the [env]{.title-ref} object itself, pre-configured with all
  the required properties for the proper functioning of web components,
  such as [getTemplate]{.title-ref} or [translateFn]{.title-ref};
- spawning a [MockServer]{.title-ref} (if one did not exist already for
  that test);
- starting all registered `services <../services>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, and awaiting until they are all ready;
- initiating other features that are not tied to a service, such as the
  web [router]{.title-ref};
- guaranteeing the teardown of all the features in its setup at the end
  of the test.

This method is great for testing low-level features, such as
`services <../services>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} that are not tied
to a
[Component](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/reference/component.md):

``` javascript
// Can be further configured, but is already packed with all the necessary stuff
const env = await makeMockEnv();

expect(env.isSmall).toBe(false);
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Like `makeMockServer <mock-server/spawning>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, only one [env]{.title-ref} can be active for a given test.
It is not necessary to call [makeMockEnv]{.title-ref} manually to
retrieve the current environment instance; the [getMockEnv]{.title-ref}
helper can be called instead.
::::

::: example
- [DateTime input
  tests]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/tests/core/components/datetime/datetime_input.test.js)
- [Name service
  tests]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/tests/core/name_service.test.js)
:::

## Mounting components {#web-test-helpers/components}

Instantiating and appending
[components](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/reference/component.md)
to the DOM is meant to be easy, through the use of the
[mountWithCleanup]{.title-ref} helper. It will prepare an
[env]{.title-ref} internally (if one does not exist yet), which in turn
also makes sure that a [MockServer]{.title-ref} is running.

It takes a [Component]{.title-ref} class as its first argument, and an
*optional* parameters second argument, used to specify
[props]{.title-ref} or a custom \`target\`:

``` javascript
await mountWithCleanup(Checkbox, {
    props: {
        value: false
    },
});
```

This helper will return the active [Component]{.title-ref} instance.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

It is generally *ill-advised* to retrieve the [Component]{.title-ref}
instance to directly interact with it or to perform assertions on its
internal variables. The only \"accepted\" use cases are when the
[Component]{.title-ref} is displaying hard-to-retrieve information in
the DOM, such as graphs in a
[canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).
For most cases, it is highly preferred to query derived information in
the DOM.

## Mounting views {#web-test-helpers/views}

Mounting a view is simply a matter of using
`mountWithCleanup <web-test-helpers/components>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} with the
[View](%7BGITHUB_PATH%7D/addons/web/static/src/views/view.js) component
and the correct properties.

For that purpose, web test helpers export a [mountView]{.title-ref}
helper, taking a parameters object determining the view
[type]{.title-ref}, [resModel]{.title-ref}, and other optional
properties such as an XML \`arch\`:

``` javascript
// Resolves when the view is fully ready
await mountView({
    type: "list",
    resModel: "res.partner",
    arch: /* xml */ `
        <list>
            <field name="display_name" />
        </list>
    `,
});
```

Like the previous helpers on top of which [mountView]{.title-ref} is
built, it will ensure that both an [env]{.title-ref} and a
[MockServer]{.title-ref} are running for the current test.

:::: note

Note
:::

Like `mountWithCleanup <web-test-helpers/components>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, it is *NOT* recommended to retrieve the returned
[View](%7BGITHUB_PATH%7D/addons/web/static/src/views/view.js) component
instance. It can however be done, for cases like the [Graph
view]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/src/views/graph/graph_view.js).
::::

::: example
- [Calendar view
  tests]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/tests/views/calendar/calendar_view.test.js)
- [Graph view
  tests]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/tests/views/graph/graph_view.test.js)
- [Kanban view
  tests]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/tests/views/kanban/kanban_view.test.js)
:::

## Interacting with components

Hoot provides helpers to interact with the DOM (e.g.
[click]{.title-ref}, [press]{.title-ref}, etc.). However, these helpers
present 2 issues when interacting with more complex components:

1.  helpers try to interact instantly, while sometimes the element has
    yet to be appended to the document (in an unknown amount of time);
2.  helpers only wait a single micro-task tick per dispatched event,
    while most Owl-based UIs take at least a full animation frame to
    update.

``` javascript
// Edit record name
await click(".o_field_widget[name=name]");
await edit("Gaston Lagaffe");

// Potential error 1: button may not be in the DOM yet
await click(".btn:contains(Save)");

// Potential error 2: view is not yet updated
expect(".o_field_widget[name=name]").toHaveText("Gaston Lagaffe");
```

With these constraints in mind, web test helpers provide the
[contains]{.title-ref} helper:

``` javascript
// Combines 'click' + 'edit' + 'animationFrame' calls
await contains(".o_field_widget[name=name]").edit("Gaston Lagaffe");
// Waits for (at least) a full animation frame after the click
await contains(".btn:contains(Save)").click();
expect(".o_field_widget[name=name]").toHaveText("Gaston Lagaffe");
```

This approach, while seemingly drifting a bit further away from the
concept of \"unit testing\", is still a nice and convenient way to test
more complex units such as
[views](%7BGITHUB_PATH%7D/addons/web/static/src/views/view.js), the
[WebClient]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/src/webclient/webclient.js),
or interactions between couples of
`services <../services>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and components.

It should however not become the default for all interactions, as some
of them still need to happen *precisely* within a given time frame,
which is a concept completely ignored by [contains]{.title-ref}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Most helpers in Hoot are available as methods of a
[contains]{.title-ref} instance, with (generally) the same shape and
API.

# JavaScript Unit Testing

Writing unit tests is as important as writing the code itself: it helps
to ensure that the code is written according to a given specification
and that it remains correct as it evolves.

## Testing Framework

Testing the code starts with a testing framework. The framework provides
a level of abstraction that makes it possible to write tests in an easy
and efficient way. It also provides a set of tools to run the tests,
make assertions and report the results.

Odoo developers use a home-grown testing framework called
`HOOT (Hierarchically Organized
Odoo Tests)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. The main reason for using a
custom framework is that it allows us to extend it based on our needs
(tags system, mocking of global objects, etc.).

On top of that framework we have built a set of tools to help us write
tests for the web client ([web_test_helpers]{.title-ref}), and a mock
server to simulate the server side ([mock_server]{.title-ref}).

You can find links to the reference of each of these parts below, as
well as a section filled with examples and best practices for writing
tests.

## Setup

Before learning how to write tests, it is good to start with the basics.
The following steps will ensure that your test files are properly picked
up by the test runner.

Note that in existing addons, most of these steps can be skipped since
the proper folder structure and asset bundles are probably set up.

1.  Writing files in the right **place**:

    > All JavaScript test files should be put under the
    > [/static/tests]{.title-ref} folder of the related addon (e.g.
    > `/web/static/tests/env.test.js`{.interpreted-text role="file"}).

2.  Using the right **name**:

    > Test files must end with `.test.js`{.interpreted-text
    > role="file"}. This is not only a convention, but a requirement for
    > test files to be picked up by the runner. All other JavaScript
    > files will be interpreted either as production code (i.e. the code
    > to be tested), or as test helper files (such as
    > [web_test_helpers]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/tests/web_test_helpers.js)).
    >
    > :::: note
    > ::: title
    > Note
    > :::
    >
    > It is to be noted that there is an exception for
    > `.hoot.js`{.interpreted-text role="file"} files, which are not
    > considered as test files, but as global modules for the whole test
    > run, while other JavaScript modules are re-created for each test
    > suite. Since the same instance of these modules will be running
    > for the whole test run, they follow strict constraints, such as
    > restricted imports, or advanced memory management techniques to
    > ensure no side-effects are affecting tests.
    > ::::

3.  Calling the files in the right **bundle**:

    > Test files, added in the right folder, must be included in the
    > [web.assets_unit_tests]{.title-ref} bundle. For ease of use, this
    > can be done with glob syntax to import all test and test helper
    > files:
    >
    > ``` python
    > # Unit test files
    > 'web.assets_unit_tests': [
    >     'my_addon/static/tests/**/*',
    > ],
    > ```

4.  Heading to the right **URL**:

    > To run tests, you can then go to the [/web/tests]{.title-ref} URL.

## Writing tests

After creating and including test files, it is time to write tests. You
may refer to the following documentation sections to learn about the
testing framework.

# Upgrade scripts

An upgrade script is a Python file containing a function called
`migrate`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}, which the upgrade process
invokes during the update of a module.

::: method
migrate(cr, version)

param cr
:   current database cursor

type cr
:   `~odoo.sql_db.Cursor`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

param str version
:   installed version of the module
:::

Typically, this function executes one or multiple SQL queries and can
also access Odoo\'s ORM, as well as the
`./upgrade_utils`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

## Writing upgrade scripts

Upgrade scripts follow a specific tree structure with a naming
convention which determines when they are executed.

The structure of an upgrade script path is
`$module/migrations/$version/{pre,post,end}-*.py`{.interpreted-text
role="file"}, where [\$module]{.title-ref} is the module for which the
script will run, [\$version]{.title-ref} is the full version of the
module (including Odoo\'s major version and the module\'s minor version)
and [{pre\|post\|end}-\*.py]{.title-ref} is the file that needs to be
executed. The file\'s name will determine the `phase
<upgrade-scripts/phases>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and order in
which it is executed for that module and version.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

From Odoo 13 the top-level directory for the upgrade scripts can also be
named [upgrades]{.title-ref}. This naming is preferred since it has the
correct meaning: *migrate* can be confused with *moving out of Odoo*.
Thus `$module/upgrades/$version/`{.interpreted-text role="file"} is also
valid.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Upgrade scripts are only executed when the module is being updated.
Therefore, the module\'s minor version set in the
[\$version]{.title-ref} directory needs to be higher than the module\'s
installed version and equal or lower to the updated version of the
module.
::::

::: example
Directory structure of an upgrade script for a custom module named
[awesome_partner]{.title-ref} upgraded to version [2.0]{.title-ref} on
Odoo 17.

``` text
awesome_partner/
|-- migrations/
|   |-- 17.0.2.0/
|   |   |-- pre-exclamation.py
```

Two upgrade scripts examples with the content of the
`pre-exclamation.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"}, file adding \"!\"
at the end of partners\' names:

``` python
import logging

_logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def migrate(cr, version):
    cr.execute("UPDATE res_partner SET name = name || '!'")
    _logger.info("Updated %s partners", cr.rowcount)
```

``` python
import logging
from odoo.upgrade import util

_logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def migrate(cr, version):
    env = util.env(cr)

    partners = env["res.partner"].search([])
    for partner in partners:
        partner.name += "!"

    _logger.info("Updated %s partners", len(partners))
```

Note that in the second example, the script takes advantage of the
`./upgrade_utils`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to access the ORM. Check
the documentation to find out more about this library.
:::

## Phases of upgrade scripts {#upgrade-scripts/phases}

The upgrade process consists of three phases for each version of each
module:

> 1.  The pre-phase, before the module is loaded.
> 2.  The post-phase, after the module and its dependencies are loaded
>     and updated.
> 3.  The end-phase, after all modules have been loaded and updated for
>     that version.

Upgrade scripts are grouped according to the first part of their
filenames into the corresponding phase. Within each phase, the files are
executed according to their lexical order.

::: admonition
Execution order of example scripts for one module in one version

1.  `pre-10-do_something.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
2.  `pre-20-something_else.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
3.  `post-do_something.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
4.  `post-something.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
5.  `end-01-migrate.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
6.  `end-migrate.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"}

# Upgrade utils

[Upgrade utils](https://github.com/odoo/upgrade-util/) is a library that
contains helper functions to facilitate the writing of upgrade scripts.
This library, used by Odoo for the upgrade scripts of standard modules,
provides reliability and helps speed up the upgrade process:

- The helper functions help make sure the data is consistent in the
  database.
- It takes care of indirect references of the updated records.
- Allows calling functions and avoid writing code, saving time and
  reducing development risks.
- Helpers allow to focus on what is important for the upgrade and not
  think of details.

## Installation

Clone the [Upgrade utils
repository](https://github.com/odoo/upgrade-util/) locally and start
`odoo` with the `src` directory prepended to the `--upgrade-path`
option.

``` console
$ ./odoo-bin --upgrade-path=/path/to/upgrade-util/src,/path/to/other/upgrade/script/directory [...]
```

On platforms where you do not manage Odoo yourself, you can install this
library via \`pip\`:

``` console
$ python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/odoo/upgrade-util@master
```

On [Odoo.sh](https://www.odoo.sh/) it is recommended to add it to the
`requirements.txt`{.interpreted-text role="file"} of the custom
repository. For this, add the following line inside the file:

    odoo_upgrade @ git+https://github.com/odoo/upgrade-util@master

## Using upgrade utils

Once installed, the following packages are available for the upgrade
scripts:

- `odoo.upgrade.util`{.interpreted-text role="mod"}: the helper itself.
- `odoo.upgrade.testing`{.interpreted-text role="mod"}: base TestCase
  classes.

To use it in upgrade scripts, simply import it:

``` python
from odoo.upgrade import util


def migrate(cr, version):
   # Rest of the script
```

Now, the helper functions are available to be called through `util`.

## Util functions

Upgrade utils provides many useful functions to ease the upgrade
process. Here, we describe some of the most useful ones. Refer to the
[util folder](https://github.com/odoo/upgrade-util/tree/master/src/util)
for the comprehensive declaration of helper functions.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `cr`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} parameter in util functions
always refers to the database cursor. Pass the one received as a
parameter in `migrate`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}. Not all functions
need this parameter.

### RTL adaptations

Directional icons have `RTL (right-to-left)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} adaptations which flip the icons by 180 degrees when an
`RTL (right-to-left)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} language is
selected.

# SCSS inheritance

## Overview

Managing SCSS assets in Odoo is not as straightforward as it is in some
other environments, but it\'s highly efficient.

Modularity is key. The inheritance scheme described further allows Odoo
to:

- customize the Bootstrap CSS framework;
- handle two different webclient designs (Community and Enterprise);
- handle backend and frontend bundles separately (including the user\'s
  website design);
- contextually load only necessary assets;
- handle multiple color-schemes (e.g.: dark-mode);

## SCSS\'s [!default]{.title-ref} directive

\"Direct variables' overrides\" are technically possible in SCSS but may
lead to inconsistent results in complex environments like Odoo.

::: example
``` {.scss caption=":file:`library.scss`"}
$foo: red;
```

``` {.scss caption=":file:`customization_layer.scss`"}
$foo: blue; // -> Don't!
```
:::

Indeed, since the compilation process acts across different
interdependent bundles, re-assigning a variable in the \"wrong spot\"
may lead to unexpected cascading results.

SCSS provides several techniques to overcome these issues (e.g.:
[shadowing](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables#shadowing)),
but the most critical procedure in Odoo is the use of the
[!default]{.title-ref} flag.

When using the [!default]{.title-ref} flag, the compiler assigns a value
**only** if that variable is not yet defined.

As a result of this technique, the priority in which variables are
assigned matches the assets\' loading order.

::: example
``` {.scss caption=":file:`customization_layer.scss`"}
$foo: red !default;
```

``` {.scss caption=":file:`library.scss`"}
$foo: blue !default; // -> Already defined, line ignored.
$bar: black !default; // -> Not defined yet, value assigned.
```

``` {caption=":file:`component.scss`"}
.component {
   color: $foo; // -> 'color: red;'
   background: $bar; // -> 'background: black;'

Common Odoo classes include:

- \`oe_inline\`: prevents the usual line break following fields, and
  limits their span;

# View architectures

## Generic architecture

The architecture of a view is defined by XML data interpreted by the
JavaScript framework.

For most views, there is a `\*.rng`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file
defining the attributes and possible architectures. Some views are not
ruled by such a file either because they accept HTML content, or for
performance reasons.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The current context and user access rights may impact the view
abilities.
::::

::: seealso
`view_records`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Python expression {#reference/view_architectures/python_expression}

When evaluating node attributes, e.g. the [readonly]{.title-ref}
modifier, it is possible to provide a **Python expression** that will be
executed in an environment that has access to the following variables:

- The names of all fields present in the current view, containing the
  value of the current record, except for [column_invisible]{.title-ref}
  in
  `list view <reference/view_architectures/list/field>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}; relational fields are given as a list of IDs;
- The ID of the current record;
- \`parent\`: the record that refers to the container; only inside
  sub-views of `relational
  fields <studio/fields/relational-fields>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"};
- \`context (dict)\`: the current view\'s context;
- \`uid (int)\`: the id of the current user;
- \`today (str)\`: the current local date in the
  [YYYY-MM-DD]{.title-ref} format;
- \`now (str)\`: the current local datetime in the [YYYY-MM-DD
  hh:mm:ss]{.title-ref} format.

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<field name=\"field_a\" readonly=\"True\"/\> \<field name=\"field_b\"
invisible=\"context.get(\'show_me\') and field_a == 4\"/\>
:::

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<field name=\"field_a\"/\> \<field name=\"x2m\"\> \<!\-- sub-view \--\>
\<form\> \<field name=\"field_b\" invisible=\"parent.field_a\"/\>
\</form\> \</field\>
:::

## Form {#reference/view_architectures/form}

Form views are used to display the data from a single record. They are
composed of regular [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) with
additional semantic and structural components.

The root element of form views is [form]{.title-ref}.

``` xml
<form>
    ...
</form>
```

### Root attributes {#reference/view_architectures/form/root}

Optional attributes can be added to the root element [form]{.title-ref}
to customize the view.

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
string

The view title. It is displayed only if you open an action that has no
name and whose target is [new]{.title-ref} (opening a dialog).

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
disable_autofocus

Disable automatic focusing on the first field in the view.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   bool

default
:   [False]{.title-ref}
:::

### Semantic components {#reference/view_architectures/form/semantic}

Semantic components tie into the Odoo system and allow interaction with
it.

Form views accept the following children semantic components: `field
<reference/view_architectures/form/field>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`label <reference/view_architectures/form/label>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`button <reference/view_architectures/form/button>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`reference/view_architectures/form/chatter`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and
`reference/view_architectures/form/attachment`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Placeholders are denoted in all caps.

#### \`field\`: display field values {#reference/view_architectures/form/field}

The [field]{.title-ref} element renders (and allows editing of,
possibly) a single field of the current record.

Using the same field multiple times in a form view is supported, and the
fields can receive different values for the [invisible]{.title-ref} and
[readonly]{.title-ref} attributes. These fields may have the same values
but can be displayed differently. However, the behavior is not
guaranteed when several fields exist with different values for the
[required]{.title-ref} attribute.

``` xml
<form>
    <field name="FIELD_NAME"/>
</form>
```

The [field]{.title-ref} element can have the following attributes:

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
name

The name of the field to render.

requirement
:   Mandatory

type
:   str
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}

::::: {.attribute noindex=""}
class

The [HTML class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_attribute) to set on
the generated element.

The styling uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) framework and
`UI icons
<reference/user_interface/ui_icons>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
Common Odoo classes include:

- \`oe_inline\`: prevents the usual line break following fields, and
  limits their span;
- [oe_left]{.title-ref}, \`oe_right\`:
  [floats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float) the
  element to the corresponding direction;
- [oe_read_only]{.title-ref}, \`oe_edit_only\`: only displays the
  element in the corresponding form mode;
- \`oe_avatar\`: for image fields, displays images as an \"avatar\" (max
  90x90 square);
- \`oe_stat_button\`: defines a particular rendering to dynamically
  display information while being clickable to target an action.

`Relational fields <studio/fields/relational-fields>`{.interpreted-text

#### \`label\`: display field labels {#reference/view_architectures/form/label}

When a
`field <reference/view_architectures/form/field>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} component is not placed directly inside a
`group <reference/view_architectures/form/group>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, or when its [nolabel]{.title-ref} attribute is set, the
field\'s label is not automatically displayed alongside its value. The
[label]{.title-ref} component is the manual alternative of displaying
the label of a field.

``` xml
<form>
    <div class="col col-md-auto">
        <label for="FIELD_NAME" string="LABEL"/>
        <div>
            <field name="FIELD_NAME" class="oe_inline"/>
        </div>
    </div>
</form>
```

The [label]{.title-ref} element can have the following attributes:

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
for

The reference to the field associated with the label. It can be either
the name of the field, or its id (the [id]{.title-ref} attribute set on
the `field <reference/view_architectures/form/field>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}).

When there are several occurrences of the same field in the view, and
there are several [label]{.title-ref} components associated with these
field nodes, these labels must have unique [for]{.title-ref} attribute;
in this case, referencing the [id]{.title-ref} attribute of the
corresponding field nodes.

colleagues and customers directly from a record (task, order, invoice,
event, note\...).

It is added with a [div]{.title-ref} element with the class
[oe_chatter]{.title-ref} when the model inherits the
[mail.thread]{.title-ref} mixin.

### Structural components {#reference/view_architectures/form/structural}

Structural components provide structure or \"visual\" features with
little logic. They are used as elements or sets of elements in form
views.

Form views accept the following children structural components: `group
<reference/view_architectures/form/group>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`sheet <reference/view_architectures/form/sheet>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`notebook <reference/view_architectures/form/notebook>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`notebook <reference/view_architectures/form/notebook>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`newline <reference/view_architectures/form/newline>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`separator <reference/view_architectures/form/separator>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`header <reference/view_architectures/form/header>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`footer <reference/view_architectures/form/footer>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`reference/view_architectures/form/button_container`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and
`reference/view_architectures/form/title_container`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Placeholders are denoted in all caps.

#### \`group\`: define columns layouts {#reference/view_architectures/form/group}

The [group]{.title-ref} element is used to define column layouts in
forms. By default, groups define 2 columns, and most direct children of
groups take a single column.

`field <reference/view_architectures/form/field>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} elements that are direct children of groups display a
[label]{.title-ref} by default, and the label and the field itself have
a [colspan]{.title-ref} of [1]{.title-ref} each.

Children are laid out horizontally (they try to fill the next column
before changing row).

``` xml
<form>
    <group>
        ...
    </group>
</form>
```

The [group]{.title-ref} element can have the following attributes:

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
string

The title displayed for the group.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   str

default
:   [\'\']{.title-ref}

:   int

default
:   [1]{.title-ref}
:::

:::::: {.attribute noindex=""}
invisible

Whether the element is visible ([False]{.title-ref}) or hidden
([True]{.title-ref}), as a Python expression that evaluates to a bool.

#### \`sheet\`: make the layout responsive {#reference/view_architectures/form/sheet}

The [sheet]{.title-ref} element can be used as a direct child of the
`form
<reference/view_architectures/form>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} root
element for a narrower and more responsive form layout (centered page,
margin\...). It usually contains `group
<reference/view_architectures/form/group>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
elements.

Tip
:::

The [separator]{.title-ref} element can be used to achieve visual
separation between elements within the same inner [group]{.title-ref}
element while keeping them horizontally aligned.
::::

#### \`header\`: display workflow buttons and a status {#reference/view_architectures/form/header}

The [header]{.title-ref} element combined with the
`sheet <reference/view_architectures/form/sheet>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} element provides a full-width location above the sheet
itself generally used to display workflow
`button <reference/view_architectures/form/button>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} elements and a `field
<reference/view_architectures/form/field>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
element rendered as status widget.

``` xml
<form>
    <header>
        <BUTTONS/>
    </header>
    <sheet>
        ...
    </sheet>
</form>
```

::: example
``` xml
<header>
    <button string="Reset" type="object" name="set_draft" invisible="state != 'done'"/>
    <field name="state" widget="statusbar" statusbar_visible="draft,posted" options="{'clickable': 1}"/>
</header>
```
:::

#### \`footer\`: display dialog buttons {#reference/view_architectures/form/footer}

The [footer]{.title-ref} element is used to display
`buttons <reference/view_architectures/form/button>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} elements at the end of dialogs.

``` xml
<form>
    <sheet>
        ...
    </sheet>
    <footer>
        <BUTTONS/>
    </footer>
</form>
```

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<footer\>

:   \<button string=\"Save\" special=\"save\"/\> \<button
    string=\"Feature action\" type=\"object\" name=\"my_action\"
    class=\"btn-primary\"/\> \<button string=\"Discard\"
    special=\"cancel\"/\>

\</footer\>
:::

When no [footer]{.title-ref} element is specified, the view\'s standard
buttons (like Save or Discard) will be present by default. It is also
possible to avoid replacing the standard buttons in form or x2many
dialogs by using the [replace]{.title-ref} attribute. This attribute
defaults to [True]{.title-ref} if not specified but setting it to
[False]{.title-ref} (or 0) will make it so that the specified
[footer]{.title-ref} will be added next to the default buttons instead
of replacing them.

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<footer replace=\"0\"\>

:   \<button string=\"Custom added action\" type=\"object\"
    name=\"my_action\" class=\"btn-primary\"/\>

\</footer\>

#### Buttons container {#reference/view_architectures/form/button_container}

A `button <reference/view_architectures/form/button>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} elements container can be created with a [div]{.title-ref}
element with the class [button_box]{.title-ref}.

#### Title container {#reference/view_architectures/form/title_container}

A title
`field <reference/view_architectures/form/field>`{.interpreted-text

element with the class [oe_title]{.title-ref}.

``` xml

<form>
```

## Settings {#reference/view_architectures/settings}

Settings views are a customization of the
`form <reference/view_architectures/form>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
view. They are used to display settings in a centralized place. They
differ from generic form views in that they have a search bar and a
sidebar.

::: example
``` xml
<app string="CRM" name="crm">
    <setting type="header" string="Foo">
        <field name="foo" title="Foo?."/>
        <button name="nameAction" type="object" string="Button"/>
    </setting>
    <block title="Title of group Bar">
        <setting help="this is bar" documentation="/applications/technical/web/settings/this_is_a_test.html">
            <field name="bar"/>
        </setting>
        <setting string="This is Big BAR" company_specific="1">
            <field name="bar"/>
        </setting>
    </block>
    <block title="Title of group Foo">
        <setting string="Personalize setting" help="this is full personalize setting">
            <div>This is a different setting</div>
        </setting>
    </block>
</app>
```
:::

### Components {#reference/view_architectures/settings/components}

Settings views accept the
`field <reference/view_architectures/form/field>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `label
<reference/view_architectures/form/label>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
and `button
<reference/view_architectures/form/button>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} elements of `form
<reference/view_architectures/form>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
views, as well as three additional children elements:
`app <reference/view_architectures/settings/app>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `block
<reference/view_architectures/settings/block>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and `setting
<reference/view_architectures/settings/setting>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Placeholders are denoted in all caps.

#### \`app\`: declare the application {#reference/view_architectures/settings/app}

The [app]{.title-ref} element is used to declare the application on the
settings view. It creates an entry with the logo of the application on
the sidebar of the view. It also acts as delimiter when searching.

``` xml
<form>
    <app string="NAME" name="TECHNICAL_NAME">
    ...
    </app>
</form>
```

The [app]{.title-ref} element can have the following attributes:

#### \`setting\`: declare the setting {#reference/view_architectures/settings/setting}

The [setting]{.title-ref} element is used to declare the setting itself.

The first
`field <reference/view_architectures/form/field>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} element in the setting is used as the main field. It is
placed on the left panel if it is a boolean field, and on the top of the
right panel otherwise. The field is also used to create the setting
label if a [string]{.title-ref} attribute is not defined.

The [setting]{.title-ref} element can also contain additional elements
(e.g., HTML). All of those elements are rendered in the right panel.

``` xml
<form>
    <app string="NAME" name="TECHNICAL_NAME">
        <block title="TITLE">
            ...
            <setting string="SETTING_NAME">
                ...
                <field name="FIELD_NAME"/>
                ...
            </setting>
            ...
        </block>
    </app>
</form>
```

The [\<setting\>]{.title-ref} element can have the following attributes:

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
type

By default, a setting is visually separated on two panels (left and
right), and is used to edit a given
`field <reference/view_architectures/form/field>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. By defining [type=\"header\"]{.title-ref}, a special kind
of setting is rendered instead. This setting is used to modify the scope
of the other settings. For example, on the Website application, this
setting is used to indicate to which website the other settings apply.
The header setting is visually represented as a banner on top of the
screen.

The user is unable to interact with these data, and they will be
discarded as soon as an action is performed (record created, column
added, etc.).

### Components {#reference/view_architectures/list/components}

List views accept the following children elements: `field
<reference/view_architectures/list/field>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `button
<reference/view_architectures/list/button>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `groupby
<reference/view_architectures/list/groupby>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `header
<reference/view_architectures/list/header>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `control, and create
<reference/view_architectures/list/control>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Placeholders are denoted in all caps.

#### \`field\`: display field values {#reference/view_architectures/list/field}

The [field]{.title-ref} element renders (and allows editing of,
possibly) a single field of all current records as a column.

Using the same field multiple times in a list view is not supported

``` xml
<list>
    <field name="FIELD_NAME"/>
</list>
```

The [field]{.title-ref} element can have the following attributes:

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
name

The name of the field to render.

requirement

type
:   str
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
widget

the way the field is rendered and/or the way it can be edited. It refers
to a Javascript implementation (an Owl component) registered to the
[fields]{.title-ref} registry.

:::: {.attribute noindex=""}
sum, avg

The aggregate to display at the bottom of the column. The aggregation is
computed on only records that are currently displayed. The aggregation
operation must match the corresponding field\'s
[aggregator]{.title-ref}.

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<field name=\"sent\" sum=\"Total\" /\> \<field name=\"clicks_ratio\"
avg=\"Average\"/\>
:::

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   str

default
:   [\'\']{.title-ref}
::::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
width

The list view always tries to optimize the available space among
columns. For some field types, this is done by enforcing a width,
depending on the field type. For instance, we know exactly the number of
pixels required to display a date, so we can ensure that a column for a
date field doesn\'t take more space than what is strictly necessary,
thus leaving the extra space for the other columns. However, the
framework can\'t guess the adequate width for every field types. For
instance, char fields can be used to encode large values, or 3-letter
country codes. In the latter case, one can set the width directly in the
arch (e.g. [width=\"40px\"]{.title-ref}). It represents the width
(always in pixels) required to render the values inside the cells. The
width of the column will then be the sum of the given value and the
cells\' left and right paddings.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   str

default
:   [\'\']{.title-ref}
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
nolabel

Whether the field\'s column header should remain empty. If set, the
column will not be sortable.

It accepts only the value [\'1\']{.title-ref}

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   str

default
:   [\'\']{.title-ref}
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When a list view is grouped, numeric fields are aggregated and displayed
for each group. Also, if there are too many records in a group, a pager
appears on the right of the group row. For this reason, it is a bad
practice to have a numeric field in the last column when the list view
is in a situation where it can be grouped. However, it does not pose a
problem for X2many fields in a form view, as they cannot be grouped.

#### \`groupby\`: define group headers {#reference/view_architectures/list/groupby}

The [groupby]{.title-ref} element is used to define group headers with
`button
<reference/view_architectures/list/button>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} elements when grouping records on
`~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} fields. It also
accepts `field
<reference/view_architectures/list/field>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
elements, which can be used for modifiers. These fields thus belong on
the Many2one co-model. These extra fields are fetched in batch.

``` xml
<list>
    ...
    <groupby name="FIELD_NAME">
        <BUTTONS/>
        <FIELDS/>
    </groupby>
</list>
```

The [groupby]{.title-ref} element can have the following attributes:

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
name

The name of the a `~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}
field to use as header.

A special
`button <reference/view_architectures/list/button>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} element with [type=\"edit\"]{.title-ref} can be defined to
open the Many2one field\'s form view.

``` xml
<list>

button

The [button]{.title-ref} element allows defining buttons in the control
panel. It is the same element as the
`button element in list views <reference/view_architectures/list/button>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, but it accepts one more attribute when placed inside a
[header]{.title-ref} element:

:::: {.attribute noindex=""}
display

Make the button available at all time, without having to select records.

It accepts only the value [always]{.title-ref}.

::: example
``` xml
<header>
    <button name="toDoAlways" type="object" string="Always displayed" display="always"/>
    <button name="toDoSelection" type="object" string="Displayed if selection"/>

#### \`control\`: customize create and delete actions {#reference/view_architectures/list/control}

The [control]{.title-ref} element allows to customize the create and
delete actions. In particular, it allows to add special create buttons
with specific contexts, to use regular view buttons as create actions,
and to make the create and delete actions available only under certain
conditions.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The [control]{.title-ref} element is only supported in list views inside
`~odoo.fields.One2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"} or
`~odoo.fields.Many2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"} fields.
::::

``` xml
<list>
   <control>
       <create string="LABEL"/>
       <BUTTONS/>
       <delete invisible="parent.is_sent">
    </control>
    ...
</list>
```

The [control]{.title-ref} element takes no attributes. It accepts the
following children elements:

:::::: {.attribute noindex=""}
create

The given [create]{.title-ref} elements replace the default
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. A
[create]{.title-ref} element can have the following attributes:

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
string

The button\'s text.

requirement
:   Mandatory

type
:   str
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
context

The context that is merged into the view\'s context when performing the
button\'s call, as a Python expression that evaluates to a dict.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   `Python expression <reference/view_architectures/python_expression>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

default
:   [{}]{.title-ref}
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
invisible

Whether the element is visible ([False]{.title-ref}) or hidden
([True]{.title-ref}), as a Python expression that evaluates to a bool.
The parent record and the context can be used in the expresion.

:::

:::: attribute
delete

The [delete]{.title-ref} element allows to conditionnaly hide the delete
icon, row by row. There can only be one child of this type. It can have
only one attribute:

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
invisible

Same as for [create]{.title-ref}, except that in this case the record
itself can also be used in the expresion.

## Search {#reference/view_architectures/search}

Search views are different from other view types in that they are not
used to display content. Although they apply to a specific model, they
are used to filter another view\'s content (usually aggregated views;
e.g., `reference/view_architectures/list`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
and `reference/view_architectures/graph`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).

The root element of search views is [search]{.title-ref}.

It takes no attributes.

### Components {#reference/view_architectures/search/components}

Search views accept the following children elements: `field
<reference/view_architectures/search/field>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `filter
<reference/view_architectures/search/filter>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `separator
<reference/view_architectures/search/separator>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `group
<reference/view_architectures/search/group>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and `searchpanel
<reference/view_architectures/search/searchpanel>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Placeholders are denoted in all caps.

#### \`field\`: filter based on field values {#reference/view_architectures/search/field}

The [field]{.title-ref} element defines domains or contexts with
user-provided values. When search domains are generated, field domains
are joined with each other and with filters using the **AND** operator.

``` xml
<search>
    <field name="FIELD_NAME"/>
</search>
```

The [field]{.title-ref} element can have the following attributes:

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
name

The name of the field to filter on.

requirement
:   Mandatory

type
:   str
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
string

The label of the field.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   str

default
:   The [string]{.title-ref} attribute of the model\'s field
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
operator

By default, fields generate domains of the form
`[(name, {operator}, value)]`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}, where
[name]{.title-ref} is the field\'s name and [value]{.title-ref} is the
value provided by the user, possibly filtered or transformed (e.g., a
user is expected to provide the *label* of a selection field\'s value,
not the value itself).

The [operator]{.title-ref} attribute allows overriding the default
operator, which depends on the field\'s type (e.g., [=]{.title-ref} for
float fields, but [ilike]{.title-ref} for char fields and
[child_of]{.title-ref} for many2one).

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   str

default
:   [=]{.title-ref}
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
filter_domain

The domain to use as the field\'s search domain, as a Python expression
that evaluates to a `domain <reference/orm/domains>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

It can use the [self]{.title-ref} variable to inject the provided value
in the custom domain. It can be used to generate significantly more
flexible domains than with the [operator]{.title-ref} attribute alone
(e.g., search on multiple fields at once).

If both the [operator]{.title-ref} and [filter_domain]{.title-ref}
attributes are provided, [filter_domain]{.title-ref} takes precedence.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   `Python expression <reference/view_architectures/python_expression>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

default
:   [\[\]]{.title-ref}
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
context

The context to merge into the context of the view that the search view
is targeting, as a Python expression that evaluates to a dict.

It can contain user-provided values, which are available under the
[self]{.title-ref} variable.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   `Python expression <reference/view_architectures/python_expression>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

default
:   [{}]{.title-ref}
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
domain

The filters to apply to the completion results for fields that allow for
auto-completion (e.g., `~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text
role="class"}).

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   `Python expression <reference/view_architectures/python_expression>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

default
:   [\[\]]{.title-ref}
:::

:::: {.attribute noindex=""}
groups

The comma-separated list of user groups to whom the element is
displayed. Users who do not belong to at least one of these groups are
unable to see the element. Groups can be prefixed with the negative
[!]{.title-ref} operator to exclude them.

::: example
``` xml
<field name="FIELD_NAME" groups="base.group_no_one,!base.group_multi_company"/>
```
:::

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   str

default
:   [\'\']{.title-ref}
::::

:::::: {.attribute noindex=""}
invisible

Whether the element is visible ([False]{.title-ref}) or hidden
([True]{.title-ref}), as a Python expression that evaluates to a bool.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

There are two uses for the [invisible]{.title-ref} attribute:

- Usability: to avoid overloading the view and to make it easier for the
  user to read, depending on the content.
- Technical: a field must be present (invisible is enough) in the view

#### \`filter\`: create pre-defined filters {#reference/view_architectures/search/filter}

The [filter]{.title-ref} element is used to create pre-defined filters
that can be toggled in the search view. It allows adding data to the
search context `the context passed to the data view for
searching/filtering`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}, or appending new
sections to the search filter.

``` xml
<search>
    <filter string="LABEL" domain="DOMAIN"/>
</search>
```

The [filter]{.title-ref} element can have the following attributes:

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
name

The technical name of the filter. It can be used to
`enable it by default
<reference/view_architectures/search/defaults>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or as an `inheritance hook
<reference/view_records/inheritance>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

requirement
:   Mandatory

type
:   str
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
string

The label of the filter.

requirement
:   Mandatory

type
:   str
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
help

The tooltip displayed when hovering the filter.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   str

default
:   [\'\']{.title-ref}
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
domain

The domain to append to the action\'s domain as part of the search
domain.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   `Python expression <reference/view_architectures/python_expression>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

default
:   [\[\]]{.title-ref}
:::

::::: {.attribute noindex=""}
date

The name of the [date]{.title-ref} or [datetime]{.title-ref} field to
filter on.

When used, this attribute creates a set of filters available in a
sub-menu of the `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu. The
available filters are time-dependent but not dynamic in the sense that
their domains are evaluated at the time of the control panel
instantiation.

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<filter string=\"Creation Date\" name=\"filter_create_date\"
date=\"create_date\"/\>
:::

By default, these filters contain a dropdown with different sub-filters
that allow you to filter based on months, quarters and years.
Additionally, you can create custom sub-filters that allow filtering
using domains. These custom filters must have the following attributes:
[name]{.title-ref}, [string]{.title-ref} and [domain]{.title-ref}.

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<filter string=\"Creation Date\" name=\"filter_create_date\" date=\"create_date\"\>

:   \<filter name=\"create_date_last_30_days\" string=\"Last 30 Days\"
    domain=\"\[(\'create_date\', \'&gt;\',
    datetime.datetime.combine(context_today() - relativedelta(days=30),
    datetime.time(23, 59, 59)).to_utc())\]\"/\>

\</filter\>
:::

Note that all custom filters defined this way are mutually exclusive
with each other and with the other sub-filters.

The default period of the time-based filter (with a [date]{.title-ref}
attribute). It must be one of, or a comma-separated list of valid filter
ids.

Valid filter ids include the following:

- [first_quarter]{.title-ref}, [second_quarter]{.title-ref},
  [third_quarter]{.title-ref} and [fourth_quarter]{.title-ref}.
- One of [month]{.title-ref}, [month-x]{.title-ref} and

  value between [start_year]{.title-ref} and [end_year]{.title-ref}.
- The [name]{.title-ref} of any custom filter defined within the filter,
  prepended with [custom\_]{.title-ref}.

The filter must be in the default set of filters activated at the view
initialization.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

There are two uses for the [invisible]{.title-ref} attribute:

- Usability: to avoid overloading the view and to make it easier for the
  user to read, depending on the content.
- Technical: a field must be present (invisible is enough) in the view
  to be used in a Python expression.
::::

::: example
``` xml
<field name="fname_b" invisible="fname_c != 3 and fname_a == parent.fname_d"/>
<group invisible="fname_c != 4">
    <field name="fname_c"/>
    <field name="fname_d"/>

:::: {.attribute noindex=""}
groups

The comma-separated list of user groups to whom the element is
displayed. Users who do not belong to at least one of these groups are
unable to see the element. Groups can be prefixed with the negative
[!]{.title-ref} operator to exclude them.

::: example
``` xml

:::::: {.attribute noindex=""}
context

The context merged into the action\'s domain to generate the search
domain

The context key [group_by]{.title-ref} set with a field as value can be
used to define a group available in the `Group By`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} menu. When the field is of type [date]{.title-ref} or
[datetime]{.title-ref}, the filter generates a submenu of the
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu with the following
interval options available: `Year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Quarter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Month`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Week`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: example

Note
:::

The results of [formatted_read_group]{.title-ref} grouped on a field may
be influenced by its [group_expand]{.title-ref} attribute, allowing to
display empty groups when needed. For more information, please refer to

Caution
:::

Sequences of filters (without non-filters elements separating them) are
treated as inclusively composited: they will be composed with
[OR]{.title-ref} rather than the usual [AND]{.title-ref}.

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<filter domain=\"\[(\'state\', \'=\', \'draft\')\]\"/\> \<filter
domain=\"\[(\'state\', \'=\', \'done\')\]\"/\>

Records whose [state]{.title-ref} field is [draft]{.title-ref} or
[done]{.title-ref} are shown.

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<filter domain=\"\[(\'state\', \'=\', \'draft\')\]\"/\> \<separator/\>
\<filter domain=\"\[(\'delay\', \'&lt;\', 15)\]\"/\>

Records whose [state]{.title-ref} field is [draft]{.title-ref} **and**

#### \`separator\`: separate groups of filters {#reference/view_architectures/search/separator}

The [separator]{.title-ref} element is used to separates groups of
`filters
<reference/view_architectures/search/filter>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} in simple search views. For more complex search views, the
`group <reference/view_architectures/search/group>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} element is recommended.

``` xml
<search>
    <FILTERS/>
    <separator/>
    <FILTERS/>
</search>
```

The [separator]{.title-ref} element takes no attributes.

#### \`group\`: separate groups of filters {#reference/view_architectures/search/group}

The [group]{.title-ref} element is used to separate groups of `filters
<reference/view_architectures/search/filter>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} in cluttered search views. In simpler search views, it can
be substituted for the
`separator <reference/view_architectures/search/group>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} element.

``` xml
<search>
    <group>
        <FILTERS/>
    </group>
</search>
```

The [group]{.title-ref} element takes no attributes.

#### \`searchpanel\`: display search panels {#reference/view_architectures/search/searchpanel}

The [searchpanel]{.title-ref} element displays a search panel to the
left of multi-records views. It allows for quickly filtering data on the
basis of given fields.

``` xml
<search>
    <searchpanel>
        <FIELDS/>
    </searchpanel>
</search>
```

The [searchpanel]{.title-ref} element accepts only [field]{.title-ref}
children elements.

The [field]{.title-ref} element used as a child element of a
[searchpanel]{.title-ref} element can have the following attributes:

::: {.attribute noindex=""}

### Search defaults {#reference/view_architectures/search/defaults}

Search fields and filters can be configured through the action\'s
[context]{.title-ref} using `search_default_{name}`{.interpreted-text
role="samp"} keys. For fields, the value must be the value to set to the
field. For filters, it must be a boolean value or a number.

::: example
With [foo]{.title-ref}, a field, and [bar]{.title-ref}, a filter, the
following action context will search [foo]{.title-ref} on
[acro]{.title-ref} and enable [bar]{.title-ref} by default:

``` python
{
    'search_default_foo': 'acro',
    'search_default_bar': 1
}
```
:::

A numeric value (between 1 and 99) can be used to define the order of
default *groupby* filters.

::: example
With [foo]{.title-ref} and [bar]{.title-ref}, two *groupby* filters, the
following action context will first enable [bar]{.title-ref}, then
[foo]{.title-ref}.

``` python
{
    'search_default_foo': 2,
    'search_default_bar': 1
}
```

## Kanban {#reference/view_architectures/kanban}

Kanban views are used as a [kanban
board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) visualisation: they
display records as \"cards\", halfway between a `list
<reference/view_architectures/list>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and a
`form <reference/view_architectures/form>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
view.

Records may be grouped in columns for use in workflow visualisation or
manipulation (e.g., tasks or work-progress management), or ungrouped
(used simply to visualize records).

The root element of Kanban views is [kanban]{.title-ref}.

### Components {#reference/view_architectures/kanban/components}

Kanban views accept the following children elements: `templates
<reference/view_architectures/kanban/templates>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `field
<reference/view_architectures/kanban/field>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `header
<reference/view_architectures/kanban/header>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `progressbar
<reference/view_architectures/kanban/progressbar>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

#### \`templates\`: define cards structure {#reference/view_architectures/kanban/templates}

The [templates]{.title-ref} element is used to define the
`QWeb templates <reference/qweb>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} that
structure the kanban cards.

The definition of a card\'s structure can be split into multiple
templates for clarity, but at least one root [card]{.title-ref} template
must be defined.

An additional template can be defined: [menu]{.title-ref}. If defined,
it is rendered inside a dropdown that can be toggled with a vertical
ellipsis (`⋮`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) on the top right of
the card.

The templates are written in
`JavaScript QWeb <reference/qweb/javascript>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

``` xml
<kanban>
   <templates>
      <t t-name="card">
         <field name="name"/>
      </t>
   </templates>
</kanban>
```

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

These are QWeb templates, not [Owl](https://github.com/odoo/owl)
templates, meaning that directives like [t-on-click]{.title-ref} aren\'t
available.
::::

##### Fields

Inside those templates, the [field]{.title-ref} element allows to render
a field. It can have the following attributes:

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
name

The name of the field to render.

requirement
:   Mandatory

type
:   str
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
widget

The widget used to represent the field. The selected widget can change
the way the field is rendered and/or the way it can be edited. It refers
to a Javascript implementation (an Owl component) registered to the
[fields]{.title-ref} registry.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   str
:::

By default, field nodes are replaced by a [span]{.title-ref} containing
their formatted value, unless the [widget]{.title-ref} attribute is
specified, in which case their rendering and behavior depends on the
corresponding widget. The [widget]{.title-ref} attribute can have
different values including:

> ::: {.attribute noindex=""}
> handle
>
> Allows reordering records with a drag and drop, using the
> corresponding field as order.
> :::
>
> ::: {.attribute noindex=""}
> kanban_color_picker
>
> Allows editing a color (integer) field. Combined with the root
> attribute [highlight_color]{.title-ref}, allows editing the color of
> the cards.
> :::

See the `Field section <reference/js/widgets>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to discover various widgets and their options.

##### Rendering Context

Kanban templates being rendered with the
`QWeb engine <reference/qweb/javascript>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
they have a *rendering context*, a set of variables available in the
templates, containing useful information and tools. Here\'re the
available variables:

:::: {.attribute noindex=""}
record

An object with all the fields defined in the view. Each field has two
attributes: [value]{.title-ref} and [raw_value]{.title-ref}. The former
is formatted according to current user parameters, while the latter is
the raw value (e.g. the [id]{.title-ref} for a many2one field). This
object is useful for instance, for using field values inside
[t-if]{.title-ref} conditions. For display purposes, we recommend using
the [\<field\>]{.title-ref} tag.

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<kanban\>

:   

    \<templates\>

    :   \<field name=\"is_company\"/\> \<t t-name=\"card\"\> \<field
        name=\"name\"/\> \<field t-if=\"!record.is_company.raw_value\"
        name=\"parent_id\"\> \</t\>

    \</templates\>

\</kanban\>
:::
::::

:::: {.attribute noindex=""}
widget

An object with 2 keys defining the available actions for the user:

- \`editable\`: true if the user can edit records, false otherwise;
- \`deletable\`: true if the user can delete records, false otherwise.

This is useful to conditionally display elements requiring specific
access rights.

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<kanban\>

:   

    \<templates\>

    :   

        \<t t-name=\"card\"\>

        :   \<field name=\"name\"/\>

        \</t\> \<t t-name=\"menu\"\> \<a t-if=\"widget.deletable\"
        role=\"menuitem\" type=\"delete\"
        class=\"dropdown-item\"\>Delete\</a\> \</t\>

    \</templates\>

\</kanban\>
:::
::::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
context

The current context propagated from either the action that opens the
kanban view, or the one2many or many2many field that embeds the kanban
view in a form view.
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
read_only_mode

Indicates that the view is readonly.

type
:   bool
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
selection_mode

Whether the kanban view is opened when selecting a many2one or many2many
field (in mobile environment).

type
:   bool
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
luxon

The [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html) object,
allowing to manipulate date and datetime field values.
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
JSON

The Javascript
[JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON)
namespace object containing a [parse]{.title-ref} method allowing to
parse json field values into Javascript Objects.
:::

##### Buttons and links

While most of the kanban templates are standard
`QWeb templates <reference/qweb>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, the
kanban view processes [button]{.title-ref} and [a]{.title-ref} elements
is a special way. Buttons and links with a [type]{.title-ref} attribute
perform different operations than their standard HTML function. The
[type]{.title-ref} attribute can have the values [action]{.title-ref}
and [object]{.title-ref} of
`regular buttons <reference/view_architectures/list/button>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, or the following values:

> ::: {.attribute noindex=""}
> open
>
> Clicking the element opens the card\'s record in form view.
> :::
>
> ::: {.attribute noindex=""}
> delete
>
> Clicking the element deletes the card\'s record and removes the card.
> :::
>
> ::: {.attribute noindex=""}
> archive
>
> Clicking the element archives the card\'s record and removes the card.
> :::
>
> ::: {.attribute noindex=""}
> unarchive
>
> Clicking the element unarchives the card\'s record and removes the
> card.
> :::
>
> ::: {.attribute noindex=""}
> set_cover
>
> Clicking the element allows to select an image to set as cover image
> of the record.
> :::

##### Widgets

The [widget]{.title-ref} element allows to insert dynamically generated
(in Javascript) html inside the cards. It has a mandatory
[name]{.title-ref} attribute, referring to a Javascript implementation
(an Owl component) registered to the [view_widgets]{.title-ref}
registry.

See the
`Widget section <reference/javascript_reference/view_widgets>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to discover various widgets and their options.

##### Layouts

Several card layouts can be easily obtained using standard html elements
and [Bootstrap utility
classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/api/). By default,
the card is a [flexbox
container](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox)
with [column]{.title-ref} direction.

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<kanban\>

:   

    \<templates\>

    :   

        \<t t-name=\"card\"\>

        :   \<field class=\"fw-bold fs-5\" name=\"display_name\"/\>
            \<field class=\"text-muted\" name=\"parent_id\"/\> \<field
            name=\"tag_ids\" widget=\"many2many_tags\"/\>

        \</t\>

    \</templates\>

\</kanban\>
:::

The [footer]{.title-ref} html element is styled to stick to the bottom
of the card, and is as a flexbox container with [row]{.title-ref}
direction, allowing to easily display several fields on the same line.

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<kanban\>

:   

    \<templates\>

    :   

        \<t t-name=\"card\"\>

        :   \<field class=\"fw-bold fs-5\" name=\"display_name\"/\>
            \<field class=\"text-muted\" name=\"parent_id\"/\> \<field
            name=\"tag_ids\" widget=\"many2many_tags\"/\> \<footer\>
            \<field name=\"priority\" widget=\"priority\"/\> \<!\--
            bottom left corner \--\> \<field class=\"ms-auto\"
            name=\"activity_ids\" widget=\"kanban_activity\"/\> \<!\--
            bottom right corner \--\> \</footer\>

        \</t\>

    \</templates\>

\</kanban\>
:::

To display some content, like an image, on the side of the card, one can
use [aside]{.title-ref} and [main]{.title-ref} html elements, with the
[flex-row]{.title-ref} classname on the card. The [main]{.title-ref}
node is a flexbox container like the card is when there\'s no
[aside]{.title-ref}.

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<kanban\>

:   

    \<templates\>

    :   

        \<t t-name=\"card\" class=\"flex-row\"\>

        :   

            \<aside\>

            :   \<field name=\"avatar_128\" widget=\"image\"
                alt=\"Avatar\"/\>

            \</aside\> \<main class=\"ms-2\"\> \<field class=\"fw-bold
            fs-5\" name=\"display_name\"/\> \<field class=\"text-muted\"
            name=\"parent_id\"/\> \<field name=\"tag_ids\"
            widget=\"many2many_tags\"/\> \<footer\> \<field
            name=\"priority\" widget=\"priority\"/\> \<field
            class=\"ms-auto\" name=\"activity_ids\"
            widget=\"kanban_activity\"/\> \</footer\> \</main\>

        \</t\>

    \</templates\>

\</kanban\>
:::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The classname [o_kanban_aside_full]{.title-ref} set on the
[aside]{.title-ref} element removes the padding so that the image
spreads to the borders of the card.
::::

#### \`field\`: declare more fields to fetch {#reference/view_architectures/kanban/field}

The [field]{.title-ref} element can also be used *outside* the kanban
`templates
<reference/view_architectures/kanban/templates>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. In that case, it allows to declare fields that are not
displayed in the card, but still need to be fetched, for instance
because their value is used in a [t-if]{.title-ref} condition.

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<kanban\>

:   

    \<templates\>

    :   \<field name=\"is_company\"/\> \<t t-name=\"card\"\> \<field
        name=\"name\"/\> \<field t-if=\"!record.is_company.raw_value\"
        name=\"parent_id\"\> \</t\>

    \</templates\>

\</kanban\>
:::

#### \`header\`: display buttons in the control panel {#reference/view_architectures/kanban/header}

The [header]{.title-ref} element is used to insert custom buttons in the
control panel.

``` xml
<kanban>
   <header>
      ...
   </header>
   ...
</kanban>
```

The [header]{.title-ref} element accepts only [button]{.title-ref}
children elements, similar to `list views' button
<reference/view_architectures/list/button>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} elements.

The [button]{.title-ref} element used as a child element of the
[header]{.title-ref} element can have the following additional
attributes:

:::::::: {.attribute noindex=""}
display

The display mode of the button. It can have two different values:

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
display

The button is displayed only when some records are selected; their
action applies to the selected records.
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
always

The button is displayed at all times, even if no records are selected.
:::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Only the [always]{.title-ref} display mode is available because it is
not yet possible to select records in a kanban view.
::::

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<header\>

:   \<button name=\"toDoAlways\" type=\"object\" string=\"Always
    displayed\" display=\"always\"/\> \<button name=\"toDoSelection\"
    type=\"object\" string=\"Displayed if selection\"/\>

\</header\>

default
:   [display]{.title-ref}
::::::::

#### \`progressbar\`: show progress bars on top of columns {#reference/view_architectures/kanban/progressbar}

The [progressbar]{.title-ref} element is used to define a progress bar
to display on top of kanban columns in grouped kanban views.

``` xml
<kanban>
    <progressbar field="FIELD_NAME"/>
    ...
</kanban>
```

The [progressbar]{.title-ref} element can have the following attributes:

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
field

The name of the field on which the progress bar\'s sub-groups are based.

requirement
:   Mandatory

type
:   str
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
colors

The mapping of the progress bar\'s field values to the color values
[muted]{.title-ref}, [success]{.title-ref}, [warning]{.title-ref}, and
[danger]{.title-ref}.

requirement
:   Mandatory

type
:   [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON)
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
sum_field

The name of the field to use in a sum displayed next to the progress
bar. If not set, the total number of records is displayed instead.

\...)
:::

## QWeb {#reference/view_architectures/qweb}

QWeb views are standard `reference/qweb`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
templates inside a view\'s `arch`. They don\'t have a specific root
element. Because QWeb views don\'t have a specific root element, their
type must be specified explicitly (it can not be inferred from the root
element of the `arch` field).

QWeb views have two use cases:

- they can be used as frontend templates, in which case
  `reference/data/template`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} should be used
  as a shortcut.
- they can be used as actual qweb views (opened inside an action), in
  which case they should be defined as regular view with an explicit
  `type` (it can not be inferred) and a model.

The main additions of qweb-as-view to the basic qweb-as-template are:

- qweb-as-view has a special case for a `<nav>` element bearing the CSS
  class `o_qweb_cp_buttons`: its contents should be buttons and will be
  extracted and moved to the control panel\'s button area, the `<nav>`
  itself will be removed, this is a work-around to control panel views
  not existing yet

- qweb-as-view rendering adds several items to the standard qweb
  rendering context:

  ::: rst-class
  o-definition-list
  :::

  `model`

  :   the model to which the qweb view is bound

  `domain`

  :   the domain provided by the search view

  `context`

  :   the context provided by the search view

  `records`

  :   a lazy proxy to `model.search(domain)`, this can be used if you
      just want to iterate the records and not perform more complex
      operations (e.g. grouping)

- qweb-as-view also provides additional rendering hooks:

  - `_qweb_prepare_context(view_id, domain)` prepares the rendering
    context specific to qweb-as-view
  - `qweb_render_view(view_id, domain)` is the method called by the
    client and will call the context-preparation methods and ultimately
    `env['ir.qweb'].render()`.

## Graph {#reference/view_architectures/graph}

The graph view is used to visualize aggregations over a number of
records or record groups. Its root element is `<graph>` which can take
the following attributes:

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`type` (optional)

:   one of `bar` (default), `pie` and `line`, the type of graph to use

`stacked` (optional)

:   only used for `bar` charts. Set to `0` to prevent the bars within a
    group to be stacked initially.

`disable_linking` (optional)

:   set to `1` to prevent from redirecting clicks on graph to list view

`order` (optional)

:   if set, x-axis values will be sorted by default according their
    measure with respect to the given order (`asc` or `desc`). Only used
    for `bar` and `pie` charts.

`string` (optional)

:   string displayed in the breadcrumbs when redirecting to list view.

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
sample

Whether the view should be populated with a set of sample records if
none are found for the current model.

These fake records have heuristics for certain field names/models. For
example, a field [display_name]{.title-ref} on the model
[res.users]{.title-ref} will be populated with sample people names,
while an [email]{.title-ref} field will be in the form
[firstname.lastname@sample.demo]{.title-ref}.

The user is unable to interact with these data, and they will be
discarded as soon as an action is performed (record created, column
added, etc.).

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   bool

default
:   [False]{.title-ref}
:::

The only allowed element within a graph view is `field` which can have
the following attributes:

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`name` (mandatory)

:   the name of a field to use in the view. If used for grouping (rather
    than aggregating)

`invisible` (optional)

:   if true, the field will not appear either in the active measures nor
    in the selectable measures.

`type` (optional)

:   if set to `measure`, the field will be used as an aggregated value
    within a group instead of a grouping criteria. It only works for the
    last field with that attribute but it is useful for other fields
    with string attribute (see below).

`interval` (optional)

:   on date and datetime fields, groups by the specified interval
    (`day`, `week`, `month`, `quarter` or `year`) instead of grouping on
    the specific datetime (fixed second resolution) or date (fixed day
    resolution). Default is `month`.

`string` (optional)

:   only used for field with `type="measure"`. The name that will be
    used to display the field in the graph view, overrides the default
    python String attribute of the field.

The measures are automatically generated from the model fields; only the
aggregatable fields are used. Those measures are also alphabetically
sorted on the string of the field.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

graph view aggregations are performed on database content, non-stored
function fields can not be used in graph views
::::

In Graph views, a `field` can have a `widget` attribute to dictate its
format. The widget should be a field formatter, of which the most
interesting are `float_time`, and `monetary`.

<field name="working_hours_close" widget="float_time"/>
```

## Pivot {#reference/view_architectures/pivot}

The pivot view is used to visualize aggregations as a [pivot
table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table). Its root element is
`<pivot>` which can take the following attributes:

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`disable_linking` (optional)

:   Set to `1` to remove table cell\'s links to list view.

`display_quantity` (optional)

:   Set to `1` to display the Quantity column by default.

`default_order` (optional)

:   The name of the measure and the order (asc or desc) to use as
    default order in the view.

    ``` xml
    <pivot default_order="foo asc">
       <field name="foo" type="measure"/>
    </pivot>
    ```

The only allowed element within a pivot view is `field` which can have
the following attributes:

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`name` (mandatory)

:   the name of a field to use in the view. If used for grouping (rather
    than aggregating)

`string` (optional)

:   the name that will be used to display the field in the pivot view,
    overrides the default python String attribute of the field.

`type` (optional)

:   indicates whether the field should be used as a grouping criteria or
    as an aggregated value within a group. Possible values are:

    ::: rst-class
    o-definition-list
    :::

    `row` (default)

    :   groups by the specified field, each group gets its own row.

    `col`

    :   creates column-wise groups

    `measure`

    :   field to aggregate within a group

    `interval`

    :   on date and datetime fields, groups by the specified interval
        (`day`, `week`, `month`, `quarter` or `year`) instead of
        grouping on the specific datetime (fixed second resolution) or
        date (fixed day resolution).

`invisible` (optional)

:   if true, the field will not appear either in the active measures nor
    in the selectable measures (useful for fields that do not make sense
    aggregated, such as fields in different units, e.g. € and \$).

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
sample

Whether the view should be populated with a set of sample records if
none are found for the current model.

These fake records have heuristics for certain field names/models. For
example, a field [display_name]{.title-ref} on the model
[res.users]{.title-ref} will be populated with sample people names,
while an [email]{.title-ref} field will be in the form
[firstname.lastname@sample.demo]{.title-ref}.

The user is unable to interact with these data, and they will be
discarded as soon as an action is performed (record created, column
added, etc.).

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   bool

default
:   [False]{.title-ref}
:::

The measures are automatically generated from the model fields; only the
aggregatable fields are used. Those measures are also alphabetically
sorted on the string of the field.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

like the graph view, the pivot aggregates data on database content which
means that non-stored function fields can not be used in pivot views
::::

In Pivot view a `field` can have a `widget` attribute to dictate its
format. The widget should be a field formatter, of which the most
interesting are `date`, `datetime`, `float_time`, and `monetary`.

For instance a timesheet pivot view could be defined as:

    <pivot string="Timesheet">
        <field name="employee_id" type="row"/>
        <field name="date" interval="month" type="col"/>
        <field name="unit_amount" type="measure" widget="float_time"/>
    </pivot>

## Calendar {#reference/view_architectures/calendar}

Calendar views display records as events in a daily, weekly, monthly or
yearly calendar.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

By default the calendar view will be centered around the current date
(today). You can pass a specific initial date to the context of the
action in order to set the initial focus of the calendar on the period
(see [mode]{.title-ref}) around this date (the context key to use being
[initial_date]{.title-ref})

selecting an area of calendar cells. One record is then created for each
selected cell and for each active filter\'s value, with the values of
the multi create form view, which is displayed in the side panel. In
delete mode, all records displayed in selected cells are deleted.

Note: if the side panel contains multiple filter sections, only the
first one is used, to avoid a combinatorial explosion.

### Components {#reference/view_architectures/calendar/components}

Calendar views accept a single type of child elements: `<field>`. Those
fields are displayed in a popover, in the given order, which opens when
a record (a calendar event) is clicked.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Fields in the popover are readonly. If the [edit]{.title-ref} action is
available, an [Edit]{.title-ref} button is displayed in the popover, to
open a form view where fields can be edited.
::::

Field nodes can have the following attributes:

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
name

The name of the field to render.

requirement
:   Mandatory

type
:   str
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
widget

The widget used to represent the field. The selected widget can change
the way the field is rendered and/or the way it can be edited. It refers
to a Javascript implementation (an Owl component) registered to the
[fields]{.title-ref} registry.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   str
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
invisible

Python expression indicating whether the field should be displayed or
not. Other fields of the model can be used in the expression, as long as
those fields are also declared here.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   `Python expression <reference/view_architectures/python_expression>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

default
:   [False]{.title-ref}
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
options

Python expression encoding an object of options for the field. In
particular, the option [icon]{.title-ref}, allowing to specify, as
classnames, which icon to display in front of the field in the popover
(for instance, [fa fa-users]{.title-ref}). If no icon is given, the
option [string]{.title-ref} can be set, and its value is then used as
label, displayed in front of the field.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   `Python expression <reference/view_architectures/python_expression>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

default
:   [{}]{.title-ref}
:::

Specifying a `<field>` in a calendar arch also allows to customize the
filter side panel, by setting the [filters]{.title-ref} attribute. Extra
attributes are then available for that matter:

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
filters

If set to true, the field can be used as filter, from the side panel of
the calendar.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   bool

default
:   [False]{.title-ref}
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
avatar_field

Only for relational fields. Specify the name of the field on the
co-model to use to display as avatar in front of field values in the
side panel filters.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   str
:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
color

Specify which field to use to colorize the checkbox in the side panel
filters. By default, the color attribute of the calendar view is used to
match events with values in the filters.

requirement

:::

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
write_model

Allows to create new filter values on the fly. The given model is then
used as model for those filters. To combine with
[write_field]{.title-ref}.

requirement

## Activity {#reference/view_architectures/activity}

The Activity view is used to display the activities linked to the
records. The data are displayed in a chart with the records forming the
rows and the activity types the columns. The first cell of each row
displays a (customizable, see `templates`, quite similarly to
`reference/view_architectures/kanban`{.interpreted-text role="ref"})
card representing the corresponding record. When clicking on others
cells, a detailed description of all activities of the same type for the
record is displayed.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

The Activity view is only available when the `mail` module is installed,
and for the models that inherit from the `mail.activity.mixin`.
::::

The root element of the Activity view is `<activity>`, it accepts the
following attributes:

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`string` (mandatory)

:   A title, which should describe the view

Possible children of the view element are:

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`field`

:   declares fields to use in activity *logic*. If the field is simply
    displayed in the activity view, it does not need to be pre-declared.

    Possible attributes are:

    ::: rst-class
    o-definition-list
    :::

    `name` (required)

    :   the name of the field to fetch

`templates`

:   defines the `reference/qweb`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    templates. Cards definition may be split into multiple templates for
    clarity, but activity views *must* define at least one root template
    `activity-box`, which will be rendered once for each record.

    The activity view uses mostly-standard `javascript qweb
    <reference/qweb/javascript>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
    provides the following context variables (see
    `reference/view_architectures/kanban`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    for more details):

    ::: rst-class
    o-definition-list
    :::

    `widget`

    :   the current `ActivityRecord`{.interpreted-text role="js:class"},
        can be used to fetch some meta-information. These methods are
        also available directly in the template context and don\'t need
        to be accessed via `widget`

    `record`

    :   an object with all the requested fields as its attributes. Each
        field has two attributes `value` and `raw_value`

## Cohort {#reference/view_architectures/cohort}

<span class="badge" style="background-color:#AD5E99">Enterprise feature</span>

The cohort view is used to display and understand the way some data
changes over a period of time. For example, imagine that for a given
business, clients can subscribe to some service. The cohort view can
then display the total number of subscriptions each month, and study the
rate at which client leave the service (churn). When clicking on a cell,
the cohort view will redirect you to a new action in which you will only
see the records contained in the cell\'s time interval; this action
contains a list view and a form view.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

By default the cohort view will use the same list and form views as
those defined on the action. You can pass a list view and a form view to
the context of the action in order to set/override the views that will
be used (the context keys to use being [form_view_id]{.title-ref} and
[list_view_id]{.title-ref})
::::

For example, here is a very simple cohort view:

``` xml
<cohort string="Subscription" date_start="date_start" date_stop="date" interval="month"/>
```

The root element of the Cohort view is \<cohort\>, it accepts the
following attributes:

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`string` (mandatory)

:   A title, which should describe the view

`date_start` (mandatory)

:   A valid date or datetime field. This field is understood by the view
    as the beginning date of a record

`date_stop` (mandatory)

:   A valid date or datetime field. This field is understood by the view
    as the end date of a record. This is the field that will determine
    the churn.

`disable_linking` (optional)

:   Set to `1` to prevent from redirecting clicks on cohort cells to
    list view.

`mode` (optional)

:   A string to describe the mode. It should be either \'churn\' or
    \'retention\' (default). Churn mode will start at 0% and accumulate
    over time whereas retention will start at 100% and decrease over
    time.

`timeline` (optional)

:   A string to describe the timeline. It should be either \'backward\'
    or \'forward\' (default). Forward timeline will display data from
    date_start to date_stop, whereas backward timeline will display data
    from date_stop to date_start (when the date_start is in future /
    greater than date_stop).

`interval` (optional)

:   A string to describe a time interval. It should be \'day\',
    \'week\', \'month\'\' (default) or \'year\'.

`measure` (optional)

:   A field that can be aggregated. This field will be used to compute
    the values for each cell. If not set, the cohort view will count the
    number of occurrences.

`<field>` (optional)

:   allows to specify a particular field in order to manage it from the
    available measures, it\'s main use is for hiding a field from the
    selectable measures:

    ::: rst-class
    o-definition-list
    :::

    `name` (mandatory)

    :   the name of the field to use in the view.

    `string` (optional)

    :   the name that would be used to display the field in the cohort
        view, overrides the default python String attribute of the
        field.

    `invisible` (optional)

    :   if true, the field will not appear either in the active measures
        nor in the selectable measures (useful for fields that do not
        make sense aggregated, such as fields in different units, e.g. €
        and \$). If the value is a domain, the domain is evaluated in
        the context of the current row\'s record, if `True` the
        corresponding attribute is set on the cell.

    `widget` (optional)

    :   alternate representations for a field\'s display.

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
sample

Whether the view should be populated with a set of sample records if
none are found for the current model.

These fake records have heuristics for certain field names/models. For
example, a field [display_name]{.title-ref} on the model
[res.users]{.title-ref} will be populated with sample people names,
while an [email]{.title-ref} field will be in the form
[firstname.lastname@sample.demo]{.title-ref}.

The user is unable to interact with these data, and they will be
discarded as soon as an action is performed (record created, column
added, etc.).

## Grid {#reference/view_architectures/grid}

<span class="badge" style="background-color:#AD5E99">Enterprise feature</span>

### Limitations

This view is a work in progress and may have to be expanded or altered.

- only `date` column fields have been tested, `selection` and `many2one`
  are nominally implemented and supported but have not been tested,
  `datetime` is not implemented at all.
- column cells are hardly configurable and must be numerical
- cell adjustment is disabled by default and must be configured to be
  enabled
- `create`, `edit` and `delete` ACL metadata doesn\'t get automatically
  set on the view root due to limitations in `fields_view_get`
  post-processing (there\'s a fixed explicit list of the view types
  getting those attributes)

### Schema

The grid view has its own schema and additional validation in this
module. The view architecture is:

`<grid>` (1)

:   architecture root element

    - mandatory `string` attribute

    - optional `create`, `edit` and `delete` attributes

    - optional `adjustment` and `adjust_name` attributes

      `adjustment` can be either `object` or `action` to indicate
      whether a cell\'s adjustment should be performed through a method
      call or an action execution. `adjust_name` provides respectively
      the method name and the action id.

      In both cases, the adjustment parameters are provided as a
      `grid_adjust` context member, in the `object` case, the parameters
      are also provided as positional function parameters (next to an
      empty list of ids):

      `row_domain`

      :   the domain matching the entire row of the adjusted cell

      `column_field`

      :   the name of the column for the adjusted cell

      `column_value`

      :   the value of the column for the adjusted cell

      `cell_field`

      :   the measure field of the adjusted cell

      `change`

      :   the difference between the old value of the cell and the
          adjusted one, may be positive or negative

    - optional `hide_line_total` and `hide_column_total` attributes

      `hide_line_total`

      :   set to true to hide total line (default false)

      `hide_column_total`

      :   set to true to hide total column (default false)

    - optional `barchart_total` attribute

      `barchart_total`

      :   set to `true` in order to display a bar chart at the bottom of
          the grid, based on the totals of the columns (default false).

    - optional `create_inline` and `display_empty` attributes

      `create_inline`

      :   set to `true` in order to display an additional row at bottom
          of the grid with an `Add a line` button (default false). When
          this option is set to `true`, the `Add a line` button from the
          control panel is hidden. When no data is available and when
          `display_empty` is not set (so when the help content is
          displayed), the the `Add a line` button from the control panel
          is shown in order to let the user create a first record.

      `display_empty`

      :   set to `true` in order to keep displaying the grid when there
          is no data (default false). This can be useful when you want
          the user to be able to keep track of the current period (as
          dates are displayed in the columns headers). As a reminder,
          when no data are present and when this attribute is no set,
          the help content is displayed instead of the grid.

`<button>` (0+)

:   Regular Odoo action buttons, displayed in the view header

    - mandatory `string` attribute (the button label)

    - mandatory `type` attribute, either `object` or `action`

      :::: note
      ::: title
      Note
      :::

      workflow buttons are not supported
      ::::

    - mandatory `name` attribute, either the name of the method to call,
      or the ID of the action to execute

    - optional `context`

    The server callback is provided with all the record ids displayed in
    the view, either as the ids passed to the method (`object` button)
    or as the context\'s `active_ids` (`action` buttons)

`<field type="row">` (1+)

:   Row grouping fields, will be replaced by the search view\'s groupby
    filter if any.

    The order of `row` fields in the view provides their grouping depth:
    if the first field is `school` and the second is `age` the records
    will be grouped by `school` first and by `age` within each school.

`<field type="col">` (1)

:   Column grouping field.

    The col field can contain 0+ `<range>` elements which specify
    customisable column ranges. `range` elements have the following
    mandatory attributes

    `name`

    :   can be used to override the default range (the first one by
        default) through the `grid_range` context value

    `string`

    :   the range button\'s label (user-visible)

    `span`

    :   symbolic name of the span of all columns to display at once in
        the view, may trigger pagination.

        For `date` fields, valid spans are currently `week` and `month`.

    `step`

    :   symbolic name of the step between one column and the
        previous/next

        For `date` fields, the only valid span is currently `day`.

`<field type="measure">` (1)

:   Cell field, automatically accumulated (by `read_group`).

    The measure field can take a `widget` attribute to customise its
    display.

### Server interactions

Aside from optional buttons, the grid view currently calls two methods:

- `read_grid` (provided on all models by the module) returns almost the
  entirety of the grid\'s content as a dict:
  - the row titles is a list of dictionaries with the following keys:

    `values` (required)

    :   this maps to a dictionary with a key per `row` field, the values
        are *always* of the form `[value, label]`.

    `domain` (required)

    :   the domain of any record at the source of this row, in case
        it\'s necessary to copy a record during cell adjustment

  - the column titles is a list of dictionaries with at least one key:

    `values` (required)

    :   see row title values

    `domain` (required)

    :   see column domain value

    `current` (optional)

    :   boolean, marks/highlights a column

  - the grid data as a list (of rows) of list (of cells) of cell dicts
    each with the following keys:

    `value`

    :   the numeric value associated with the cell

    `domain`

    :   the domain matching the cell\'s records (should be assumed
        opaque)

    `size`

    :   the number of records grouped in the cell

    `readonly` (optional)

    :   a boolean indicating that this specific cell should not be
        client-editable

    `classes` (optional)

    :   a list of classes (as strings) to add on the cell\'s container
        (between the cell\'s TD and the cell\'s potentially-editable
        element).

        In case of conflicts between this list and the base classes
        (prefixed with `o_grid_cell_`), the classes in this list are
        ignored.

    Note that the grid data is *dense*, if querying the database yields
    no group matching a cell a cell will generate an \"empty\" cell with
    default values for required keys.

  - `prev` and `next` which can be either falsy (no pagination) or a
    context item to merge into the view\'s own context to `read_grid`
    the previous or next page, it should be assumed to be opaque
- `read_grid_domain(field, range)` (provided on al models by the module)
  returns the domain matching the current configured \"span\" of the
  grid. This is also done internally by `read_grid`, but can be useful
  or necessary to call independently to use with separate e.g.
  `search_count` or `read_group`.
- `adjust_grid`, for which there currently isn\'t a blanket
  implementation and whose semantics are likely to evolve with time and
  use cases

### Server Hooks

`read_grid` calls a number of hooks allowing the customisation of its
operations from within without having to override the entire method:

`_grid_format_cell(group, cell_field)`

:   converts the output of a read_group (group-by-group) into cells in
    the format described above (as part of \"the grid data\")

`_grid_make_empty_cell(row_domain, column_domain, view_domain)`

:   generates an empty version of a cell (if there is no corresponding
    group)

`_grid_column_info(name, range)`

:   generates a ColumnMetadata object based on the column type, storing
    values either returned directly (as part of `read_grid`) or used
    query and reformat `read_group` into `read_grid`:

    `grouping`

    :   the actual grouping field/query for the columns

    `domain`

    :   domain to apply to `read_group` in case the column field is
        paginated, can be an empty list

    `prev` and `next`

    :   context segments which will be sent to `read_grid` for pages
        before and after the current one. If `False`, disables
        pagination in that direction

    `values`

    :   column values to display on the \"current page\", each value is
        a dictionary with the following keys:

        `values`

        :   dictionary mapping field names to values for the entire
            column, usually just `name` -\> a value

        `domain`

        :   domain matching this specific column

        `is_current`

        :   `True` if the current column should be specifically outlined
            in the grid, `False` otherwise

        `format`

        :   how to format the values of that column/type from
            `read_group` formatting to `read_grid` formatting (matching
            `values` in ColumnInfo)

### ACL

- if the view is not editable, individual cells won\'t be editable
- if the view is not creatable, the `Add a Line` button will not be
  displayed (it currently creates a new empty record)

### Context Keys

`grid_range`

:   selects which range should be used by default if the view has
    multiple ranges

`grid_anchor`

:   if applicable, used as the default anchor of column ranges instead
    of whatever `read_grid` defines as its default.

    For date fields, the reference date around which the initial span
    will be computed. The default date anchor is \"today\" (in the
    user\'s timezone)

## Gantt {#reference/view_architectures/gantt}

<span class="badge" style="background-color:#AD5E99">Enterprise feature</span>

Gantt views appropriately display Gantt charts (for scheduling).

The root element of gantt views is `<gantt/>`, it has no children but
can take the following attributes:

string

:   string (default: `''`)

    This view title is displayed only if you open an action that has no
    name and whose target is \'new\' (opening a dialog)

create

:   bool (default: `True`)

    Disable/enable record creation on the view.

edit

:   bool (default: `True`)

    Disable/enable record edition on the view.

delete

:   bool (default: `True`)

    Disable/enable record deletion on the view through the **Action**
    dropdown.

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`date_start` (required)

:   name of the field providing the start datetime of the event for each
    record.

`date_stop` (required)

:   name of the field providing the end duration of the event for each
    record.

`dependency_field`

:   name of the `many2many` field that provides the dependency relation
    between two records. If B depends on A, `dependency_field` is the
    field that allows getting A from B. Both this field and
    `dependency_inverted_field` field are used to draw dependency arrows
    between pills and reschedule them.

`dependency_inverted_field` (required if `dependency_field` is provided)

:   name of the `many2many` field that provides the invert dependency
    relation than `dependency_field`. If B depends on A,
    `dependency_inverted_field` is the field that allows getting B from
    A.

`color`

:   name of the field used to color the pills according to its value

`decoration-{$name}`

:   [python
    expression](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-operations-and-or-not)
    that evaluates to a bool

    allow changing the style of a cell\'s text based on the
    corresponding record\'s attributes.

    `{$name}` can be one of the following [bootstrap contextual
    color](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#available-variations)
    (`danger`, `info`, `secondary`, `success` or `warning`).

    Define a conditional display of a record in the style of a row\'s
    text based on the corresponding record\'s attributes.

    Values are Python expressions. For each record, the expression is
    evaluated with the record\'s attributes as context values and if
    `true`, the corresponding style is applied to the row. Here are some
    of the other values available in the context:

    - `uid`: the id of the current user,
    - `today`: the current local date as a string of the form
      `YYYY-MM-DD`,
    - `now`: same as `today` with the addition of the current time. This
      value is formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`.

    ``` xml
    <gantt decoration-info="state == 'draft'"
          decoration-danger="state == 'help_needed'"
          decoration-bf="state == 'busy'">
      ...
    </gantt>
    ```

`default_group_by`

:   name of a field to group tasks by

`disable_drag_drop`

:   if set to true, the gantt view will not have any drag&drop support

`consolidation`

:   field name to display consolidation value in record cell

`consolidation_max`

:   dictionary with the \"group by\" field as key and the maximum
    consolidation value that can be reached before displaying the cell
    in red (e.g. `{"user_id": 100}`)

`consolidation_exclude`

:   name of the field that describes if the task has to be excluded from
    the consolidation if set to true it displays a striped zone in the
    consolidation line

`create`, `cell_create`, `edit`, `delete`, `plan`

:   allows *dis*abling the corresponding action in the view by setting
    the corresponding attribute to `false` (default: `true`).

    - `create`: If enabled, an `Add` button will be available in the
      control panel to create records.
    - `cell_create`: If enabled and `create` enabled, a \"\*\*+\*\*\"
      button will be displayed while hovering on a time slot cell to
      create a new record on that slot.
    - `edit`: If enabled, the opened records will be in edit mode (thus
      editable).
    - `plan`: If enabled and `edit` enabled, a \"magnifying glass\"
      button will be displayed on time slots to plan unassigned records
      into that time slot.

    ::: example
    When you do not want to create records on the gantt view and the
    beginning and end dates are required on the model, the planning
    feature should be disabled because no record will ever be found.
    :::

`offset`

:   Depending on the scale, the number of units to add to today to
    compute the default period. Examples: An offset of +1 in
    default_scale week will open the gantt view for next week, and an
    offset of -2 in default_scale month will open the gantt view of 2
    months ago.

`progress`

:   name of a field providing the completion percentage for the
    record\'s event, between 0 and 100

`string`

:   title of the gantt view

`precision`

:   JSON object specifying snapping precisions for the pills in each
    scale.

    Possible values for scale `day` are (default: `hour`):

    - `hour`: records times snap to full hours (ex: 7:12 becomes 8:00)
    - `hour:half`: records times snap to half hours (ex: 7:12 becomes
      7:30)
    - `hour:quarter`: records times snap to half hours (ex: 7:12 becomes
      7:15)

    Possible values for scale `week` are (default: `day:half`):

    - `day`: records times snap to full days (ex: 7:28 AM becomes
      11:59:59 PM of the previous day, 10:32 PM becomes 12:00 PM of the
      current day)
    - `day:half`: records times snap to half hours (ex: 7:28 AM becomes
      12:00 PM)

    Possible values for scale `month` are (default: `day:half`):

    - `day`: records times snap to full days (ex: 7:28 AM becomes
      11:59:59 PM of the previous day, 10:32 PM becomes 12:00 PM of the
      current day)
    - `day:half`: records times snap to half hours (ex: 7:28 AM becomes
      12:00 PM)

    Scale `year` always snap to full day.

    Example of precision attribute:
    `{"day": "hour:quarter", "week": "day:half", "month": "day"}`

`total_row`

:   boolean to control whether the row containing the total count of
    records should be displayed. (default: `false`)

`collapse_first_level`

:   boolean to control whether it is possible to collapse each row if
    grouped by one field. (default: `false`, the collapse starts when
    grouping by two fields)

`display_unavailability`

:   boolean to mark the dates returned by the `gantt_unavailability`
    function of the model as available inside the gantt view. Records
    can still be scheduled in them, but their unavailability is visually
    displayed. (default: `false`)

`default_scale`

:   default scale when rendering the view. Possible values are (default:
    `month`):

    - `day`
    - `week`
    - `month`
    - `year`

`scales`

:   comma-separated list of allowed scales for this view. By default,
    all scales are allowed. For possible scale values to use in this
    list, see `default_scale`.

`templates`

:   defines the `reference/qweb`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} template
    `gantt-popover` which is used when the user hovers over one of the
    records in the gantt view.

    The gantt view uses mostly-standard `javascript qweb
    <reference/qweb/javascript>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
    provides the following context variables:

    ::: rst-class
    o-definition-list
    :::

    `widget`

    :   the current `GanttRow`{.interpreted-text role="js:class"}, can
        be used to fetch some meta-information. The `getColor` method to
        convert in a color integer is also available directly in the
        template context without using `widget`.

    `on_create`

    :   If specified when clicking the add button on the view, instead
        of opening a generic dialog, launch a client action. this should
        hold the xmlid of the action (eg:
        `on_create="%(my_module.my_wizard)d"`

`form_view_id`

:   view to open when the user create or edit a record. Note that if
    this attribute is not set, the gantt view will fall back to the id
    of the form view in the current action, if any.

`dynamic_range`

:   if set to true, the gantt view will start at the first record,
    instead of starting at the beginning of the year/month/day.

`pill_label`

:   If set to true, the time appears in the pill label when the scale is
    set on week or month. (e.g. [7:00 AM - 11:00 AM (4h) - DST Task
    1]{.title-ref})

`thumbnails`

:   This allows to display a thumbnail next to groups name if the group
    is a relationnal field. This expects a python dict which keys are
    the name of the field on the active model. Values are the names of
    the field holding the thumbnail on the related model.

    Example: tasks have a field user_id that reference res.users. The
    res.users model has a field image that holds the avatar, then:

    ``` xml
    <gantt
       date_start="date_start"
       date_stop="date_stop"
       thumbnails="{'user_id': 'image_128'}"
     >
     </gantt>
    ```

    will display the users avatars next to their names when grouped by
    user_id.

::: {.attribute noindex=""}
sample

Whether the view should be populated with a set of sample records if
none are found for the current model.

These fake records have heuristics for certain field names/models. For
example, a field [display_name]{.title-ref} on the model
[res.users]{.title-ref} will be populated with sample people names,
while an [email]{.title-ref} field will be in the form
[firstname.lastname@sample.demo]{.title-ref}.

The user is unable to interact with these data, and they will be
discarded as soon as an action is performed (record created, column
added, etc.).

:   Optional

type
:   bool

default
:   [False]{.title-ref}
:::

## Map {#reference/view_architectures/map}

<span class="badge" style="background-color:#AD5E99">Enterprise feature</span>

This view is able to display records on a map and the routes between
them. The records are represented by pins. It also allows the
visualization of fields from the model in a popup tied to the record\'s
pin.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The model on which the view is applied should contain a
[res.partner]{.title-ref} many2one since the view relies on the
[res.partner]{.title-ref}\'s address and coordinates fields to localize
the records.
::::

### API

The view uses location data platforms\' API to fetch the tiles (the
map\'s background), do the geoforwarding (converting addresses to a set
of coordinates) and fetch the routes. The view implements two API,
OpenStreetMap and MapBox. OpenStreetMap is used by default and is able
to fetch [tiles](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_data_server)
and do [geoforwarding](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/).
This API does not require a token. As soon as a valid
[MapBox](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/) token is provided in the general
settings the view switches to the MapBox API. This API is faster and
allows the computation of routes. A token can be obtained by [signing
up](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/) to MapBox.

### Structural components

The view\'s root element is `<map>`. It can have the following
attributes:

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`res_partner`

:   Contains the [res.partner]{.title-ref} many2one. If not provided the
    view resorts to create an empty map.

`default_order`

:   If a field is provided the view overrides the model\'s default
    order. The field must be part of the model on which the view is
    applied, not from [res.partner]{.title-ref}.

`routing`

:   if `1` display the routes between the records. The view needs a
    valid MapBox token and at least two located records (i.e the records
    have a [res.partner]{.title-ref} many2one and the partner has an
    address or valid coordinates).

`hide_name`

:   if `1` hide the name from the pin\'s popup (default: `0`).

`hide_address`

:   if `1` hide the address from the pin\'s popup (default: `0`).

`hide_title`

:   if `1` hide the title from the pin list (default: `0`).

`panel_title`

:   String to display as title of the pin list. If not provided, the
    title is the action\'s name or \"Items\" if the view is not in an
    action.

`limit`

:   Maximum number of records to fetch (default: `80`). It must be a
    positive integer.

The `<map>` element can contain multiple `<field>` elements. Each
`<field>` element is interpreted as a line in the pin\'s popup. The
field\'s attributes are the following:

::: rst-class
o-definition-list
:::

`name`

:   The field to display.

`string`

:   String to display before the field\'s content. It can be used as a
    description.

For example here is a map:

:   ``` xml
    <map res_partner="partner_id" default_order="date_begin" routing="1" hide_name="1">
        <field name="partner_id" string="Customer Name"/>
    </map>
    ```

# View records

Views are what define how records should be displayed to end-users. They
are specified in XML and stored as records themselves, meaning they can
be edited independently from the models that they represent. They are
flexible and allow a high level of customization of the screens that
they control. There exist various
`types of views <reference/view_records/types>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Each represents a visualization mode: *form*, *list*,
*kanban*, etc.

## Generic structure {#reference/view_records/structure}

Basic views generally share the common minimal structure defined below.
Placeholders are denoted in all caps.

``` xml
<record id="ADDON.MODEL_view_TYPE" model="ir.ui.view">
  <field name="name">NAME</field>
  <field name="model">MODEL</field>
  <field name="arch" type="xml">
    <VIEW_TYPE>
      <views/>
    </VIEW_TYPE>
  </field>
</record>
```

## View types {#reference/view_records/types}

`Form <reference/view_architectures/form>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

:   Display and edit the data from a single record.

`List <reference/view_architectures/list>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

:   View and edit multiple records.

`Search <reference/view_architectures/search>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

:   Apply filters and perform searches. The results are displayed in the
    current list, kanban\... view.

`Kanban <reference/view_architectures/kanban>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

:   Display records as \"cards\", configurable as a small template.

`Qweb <reference/view_architectures/qweb>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

:   Templating of reporting, website\...

`Graph <reference/view_architectures/graph>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

:   Visualize aggregations over a number of records or record groups.

`Pivot <reference/view_architectures/pivot>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

:   Display aggregations as a [pivot
    table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table).

`Calendar <reference/view_architectures/calendar>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

    calendar.

`Cohort <reference/view_architectures/cohort>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} `<span class="badge" style="background-color:#714B67">Enterprise feature</span>`{=html}

:   Display and understand the way some data changes over a period of
    time.

`Grid <reference/view_architectures/grid>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} `<span class="badge" style="background-color:#714B67">Enterprise feature</span>`{=html}

:   Display computed information in numerical cells; are hardly
    configurable.

`Map <reference/view_architectures/map>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} `<span class="badge" style="background-color:#714B67">Enterprise feature</span>`{=html}

:   Display records on a map, and the routes between them.

## Fields {#reference/view_records/fields}

View records expose a number of fields.

:::::::::::: autoclass
odoo.addons.base.models.ir_ui_view.IrUiView()

::: attribute
name

Only useful as a mnemonic/description of the view when looking for one
in a list of some sort. Most Odoo view names start with the name of the
addon and end with the type of view being discussed.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   `~odoo.fields.Char`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
:::

::: attribute
model

The model linked to the view, if applicable.

requirement
:   Mandatory

type
:   `~odoo.fields.Char`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
:::

::: attribute
arch

The description of the view layout depending on the
`view type <view_architectures>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   `~odoo.fields.Text`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
:::

::: attribute
groups_id

The groups allowed to use/access the current view.

If the view extends an existing view, the extension will be applied only
for a given user, if that user has access to the provided
[groups_id]{.title-ref}.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   `~odoo.fields.Many2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"} -\>
    `~odoo.addons.base.models.res_users.Groups`{.interpreted-text
    role="class"}
:::

::: attribute
priority

When requesting a view by specifying the [model]{.title-ref} and
[type]{.title-ref}, the matching view with the lowest priority is
returned (it is the default view).

It also defines the order of views application during `view resolution
<reference/view_records/inheritance/resolution>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. When a view is requested by [id]{.title-ref} and its mode
is not [primary]{.title-ref}, its *closest* parent with
[mode]{.title-ref} = [primary]{.title-ref} is matched.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   `~odoo.fields.Integer`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
:::

::: attribute
inherit_id

Reference to the parent view on which the `inheritance
<reference/view_records/inheritance>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} will
be applied. Its value is used by default. Specify the parent using the
[ref]{.title-ref} attribute with `ref="ADDON.MODEL_parent_view_TYPE"`.

The addon name (before the dot) is not necessary if the inheritance is
done on a record of the same module.

See `reference/view_records/inheritance`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
for more information.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   `~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
:::

::::: attribute
mode

Only applies if this view inherits from an other one
([inherit_id]{.title-ref} is set).

::: attribute
extension

If the view is requested, the closest primary view is looked up (via
[inherit_id]{.title-ref}). Then, all views inheriting from it with this
view\'s model are applied.
:::

::: attribute
primary

The closest primary view is fully resolved (even if it uses a different
model than the current one). Then, the view\'s `inheritance specs
<reference/view_records/inheritance/specs>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are applied, and the result is used as if it were this
view\'s actual arch.
:::

A case in which one would want to override [mode]{.title-ref} while
using [inherit_id]{.title-ref} is delegation inheritance. In that case,
your derived model is separated from its parent, and views matching with
one won\'t match with the other. Assuming one inherits from a view
associated with the parent model and wants to customize the derived view
to show data from the derived model, the [mode]{.title-ref} of the
derived view needs to be set to [primary]{.title-ref} because it is the
base (and maybe only) view for that derived model. Otherwise, the
`view matching
<reference/view_records/inheritance/resolution>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} rules won\'t apply.

See `reference/view_records/inheritance`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
for more information.

requirement
:   Optional

type
:   `~odoo.fields.Selection`{.interpreted-text role="class"}:
    [extension]{.title-ref} / [primary]{.title-ref}

default

## Inheritance {#reference/view_records/inheritance}

Inheritance allows for customizing delivered views. It makes it
possible, for example, to add content as modules are installed, or to
deliver different displays according to the action.

Inherit views generally share the common structure defined below.
Placeholders are denoted in all caps. This synthetic view will update a
node targeted by an XPath, and another targeted by its name and
attributes.

``` xml
<record id="ADDON.MODEL_view_TYPE" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="model">MODEL</field>
    <field name="inherit_id" ref="VIEW_REFERENCE"/>
    <field name="mode">MODE</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <xpath expr="XPATH" position="POSITION">
            <CONTENT/>
        </xpath>
        <NODE ATTRIBUTES="VALUES" position="POSITION">
            <CONTENT/>
        </NODE>
    </field>
</record>
```

The [inherit_id]{.title-ref} and [mode]{.title-ref} fields determine the
`view resolution
<reference/view_records/inheritance/resolution>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. The [xpath]{.title-ref} or [NODE]{.title-ref} elements
indicate the
`inheritance specs <reference/view_records/inheritance/specs>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. The [expr]{.title-ref} and [position]{.title-ref}
attributes specify the
`inheritance position <reference/view_records/inheritance/position>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### View resolution {#reference/view_records/inheritance/resolution}

Resolution generates the final [arch]{.title-ref} for a
requested/matched [primary]{.title-ref} view as follow:

1.  if the view has a parent, the parent is fully resolved, then the
    current view\'s inheritance specs are applied;
2.  if the view has no parent, its [arch]{.title-ref} is used as-is;
3.  the current view\'s children with mode [extension]{.title-ref} are
    looked up, and their inheritance specs are applied depth-first (a
    child view is applied, then its children, then its siblings).

The inheritance is applied according to the [inherit_id]{.title-ref}
field. If several view records inherit the same view, the order is
determined by the [priority]{.title-ref}.

The result of applying children views yields the final
[arch]{.title-ref}.

::: todo
NOTE on fields_view_get and link to ORM ?
:::

### Inheritance specs {#reference/view_records/inheritance/specs}

Inheritance specs are applied sequentially and are comprised of:

1.  an element locator to match the inherited element in the parent
    view;
2.  children element to modify the inherited element.

There are three types of element locators:

- An [xpath]{.title-ref} element with an [expr]{.title-ref} attribute.
  [expr]{.title-ref} is an [XPath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath)
  expression[^1] applied to the current [arch]{.title-ref}, matching the
  first node it finds;

- A [field]{.title-ref} element with a [name]{.title-ref} attribute,
  matching the first field with the same [name]{.title-ref}.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  All other attributes are ignored.
  ::::

- Any other element, matching the first element with the same
  [name]{.title-ref} and identical attributes.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  The attributes [position]{.title-ref} and [version]{.title-ref} are
  ignored.
  ::::

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<xpath expr=\"page\[@name=\'pg\'\]/group\[@name=\'gp\'\]/field\" position=\"inside\"\>

:   \<field name=\"description\"/\>

\</xpath\>

\<div name=\"name\" position=\"replace\"\>

:   \<field name=\"name2\"/\>

\</div\>
:::

### Inheritance position {#reference/view_records/inheritance/position}

The inheritance specs accept an optional [position]{.title-ref}
attribute, defaulting to [inside]{.title-ref}, that specifies how the
matched node should be modified.

:::: attribute
inside

The content of the inheritance spec is appended to the matched node.

::: example
``` xml
<notebook position="inside">
    <page string="New feature">
        ...
    </page>
</notebook>
```
:::
::::

:::: attribute
after

The content of the inheritance spec is appended to the matched node\'s
parent after the matched node.

::: example
``` xml
<xpath expr="//field[@name='x_field']" position="after">
    <field name="x_other_field"/>
</xpath>
```
:::
::::

:::: attribute
before

The content of the inheritance spec is appended to the matched node\'s
parent before the matched node.

::: example
``` xml
<field name=x_field" position="before">
    <field name="x_other_field"/>
</field>
```
:::
::::

:::: attribute
replace

The content of the inheritance spec replaces the matched node. Any text
node containing only [\$0]{.title-ref} within the contents of the spec
is replaced by a copy of the matched node, effectively wrapping the
matched node.

::: example
``` xml
<xpath expr="//field[@name='x_field']" position="replace">
    <div class="wrapper">
        $0
    </div>
</xpath>
```
:::
::::

:::: attribute
attributes

The content of the inheritance spec should be made of only
[attribute]{.title-ref} elements, each with a [name]{.title-ref}
attribute and an optional body.

- If the [attribute]{.title-ref} element has a body, a new attributed
  named after its [name]{.title-ref} is added to the matched node with
  the [attribute]{.title-ref} element\'s text as value.
- If the [attribute]{.title-ref} element has no body, the attribute
  named after its [name]{.title-ref} is removed from the matched node.
- If the [attribute]{.title-ref} element has an [add]{.title-ref}
  attribute, a [remove]{.title-ref} attribute, or both, the value of the
  matched node\'s attribute named after [name]{.title-ref} is recomputed
  to account for the value(s) of [add]{.title-ref},
  [remove]{.title-ref}, and an optional [separator]{.title-ref}
  attribute defaulting to [,]{.title-ref}. [add]{.title-ref} includes
  its value(s), separated by [separator]{.title-ref}.
  [remove]{.title-ref} removes its value(s), separated by
  [separator]{.title-ref}.

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<field name=\"x_field\" position=\"attributes\"\>

:   \<attribute name=\"invisible\"\>True\</attribute\> \<attribute
    name=\"class\" add=\"mt-1 mb-1\" remove=\"mt-2 mb-2\" separator=\"
    \"/\>

\</field\>
:::
::::

:::: attribute
move

The attribute [position=\"move\"]{.title-ref} is set on the content of
the inheritance spec to specify how nodes are moved relatively to the
inheritance spec\'s element locator, on which the attribute
[position]{.title-ref} must also be set, with values
[inside]{.title-ref}, [replace]{.title-ref}, [after]{.title-ref}, or
[before]{.title-ref}.

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<xpath <expr=%22//@target>\" position=\"after\"\>

:   \<xpath <expr=%22//@node>\" position=\"move\"/\>

\</xpath\>

\<field name=\"target_field\" position=\"after\"\>

:::

This tutorial requires
`having installed Odoo </administration/on_premise>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
::::

## Start/Stop the Odoo server

Odoo uses a client/server architecture in which clients are web browsers
accessing the Odoo server via RPC.

Business logic and extension is generally performed on the server side,
although supporting client features (e.g. new data representation such
as interactive maps) can be added to the client.

In order to start the server, simply invoke the command `odoo-bin
<reference/cmdline>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} in the shell, adding
the full path to the file if necessary:

``` bash
odoo-bin
```

The server is stopped by hitting `Ctrl-C` twice from the terminal, or by
killing the corresponding OS process.

## Build an Odoo module

Both server and client extensions are packaged as *modules* which are
optionally loaded in a *database*.

Odoo modules can either add brand new business logic to an Odoo system,
or alter and extend existing business logic: a module can be created to
add your country\'s accounting rules to Odoo\'s generic accounting
support, while the next module adds support for real-time visualisation
of a bus fleet.

Everything in Odoo thus starts and ends with modules.

### Composition of a module

An Odoo module can contain a number of elements:

Business objects

:   Declared as Python classes, these resources are automatically
    persisted by Odoo based on their configuration

`Object views <../reference/user_interface/view_architectures>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}

:   Definition of business objects UI display

`Data files <reference/data>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

:   XML or CSV files declaring the model metadata :

    - `views <../reference/user_interface/view_architectures>`{.interpreted-text
      role="doc"} or `reports
      <reference/reports>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
    - configuration data (modules parametrization,
      `security rules <reference/security>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"}),
    - demonstration data
    - and more

`Web controllers <reference/controllers>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

:   Handle requests from web browsers

Static web data

:   Images, CSS or javascript files used by the web interface or website

### Module structure

Each module is a directory within a *module directory*. Module
directories are specified by using the
`--addons-path <odoo-bin --addons-path>`{.interpreted-text
role="option"} option.

:::: {.tip .aphorism}
::: title
Tip
:::

most command-line options can also be set using `a configuration file
<reference/cmdline/config>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
::::

An Odoo module is declared by its
`manifest <reference/module/manifest>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

A module is also a [Python
package](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html#packages) with a
`__init__.py` file, containing import instructions for various Python
files in the module.

For instance, if the module has a single `mymodule.py` file
`__init__.py` might contain:

    from . import mymodule

Odoo provides a mechanism to help set up a new module, `odoo-bin
<reference/cmdline/server>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} has a
subcommand `scaffold
<reference/cmdline/scaffold>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to create an
empty module:

``` console
$ odoo-bin scaffold <module name> <where to put it>
```

The command creates a subdirectory for your module, and automatically
creates a bunch of standard files for a module. Most of them simply
contain commented code or XML. The usage of most of those files will be
explained along this tutorial.

::: exercise

Use the command line above to create an empty module Open Academy, and
install it in Odoo.
:::

### Object-Relational Mapping

A key component of Odoo is the
`ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} layer.
This layer avoids having to write most
`SQL (Structured Query Language)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by hand
and provides extensibility and security services[^1].

Business objects are declared as Python classes extending
`~odoo.models.Model`{.interpreted-text role="class"} which integrates
them into the automated persistence system.

Models can be configured by setting a number of attributes at their
definition. The most important attribute is
`~odoo.models.Model._name`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} which is
required and defines the name for the model in the Odoo system. Here is
a minimally complete definition of a model:

    from odoo import models
    class MinimalModel(models.Model):
        _name = 'test.model'

### Model fields

Fields are used to define what the model can store and where. Fields are
defined as attributes on the model class:

    from odoo import models, fields

    class LessMinimalModel(models.Model):
        _name = 'test.model2'

        name = fields.Char()

#### Common Attributes

Much like the model itself, its fields can be configured, by passing
configuration attributes as parameters:

    name = fields.Char(required=True)

Some attributes are available on all fields, here are the most common
ones:

`~odoo.fields.Field.string`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`unicode`, default: field\'s name)

:   The label of the field in UI (visible by users).

`~odoo.fields.Field.required`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`bool`, default: `False`)

:   If `True`, the field can not be empty, it must either have a default
    value or always be given a value when creating a record.

`~odoo.fields.Field.help`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`unicode`, default: `''`)

:   Long-form, provides a help tooltip to users in the UI.

`~odoo.fields.Field.index`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`bool`, default: `False`)

:   Requests that Odoo create a [database
    index](https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/preface) on the column.

#### Simple fields

There are two broad categories of fields: \"simple\" fields which are
atomic values stored directly in the model\'s table and \"relational\"
fields linking records (of the same model or of different models).

Example of simple fields are `~odoo.fields.Boolean`{.interpreted-text
role="class"}, `~odoo.fields.Date`{.interpreted-text role="class"},
`~odoo.fields.Char`{.interpreted-text role="class"}.

#### Reserved fields

Odoo creates a few fields in all models[^2]. These fields are managed by
the system and shouldn\'t be written to. They can be read if useful or
necessary:

`~odoo.fields.Model.id`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`~odoo.fields.Id`{.interpreted-text role="class"})

:   The unique identifier for a record in its model.

`~odoo.fields.Model.create_date`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`~odoo.fields.Datetime`{.interpreted-text role="class"})

:   Creation date of the record.

`~odoo.fields.Model.create_uid`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"})

:   User who created the record.

`~odoo.fields.Model.write_date`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`~odoo.fields.Datetime`{.interpreted-text role="class"})

:   Last modification date of the record.

`~odoo.fields.Model.write_uid`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"})

:   user who last modified the record.

#### Special fields

By default, Odoo also requires a `name` field on all models for various
display and search behaviors. The field used for these purposes can be
overridden by setting `~odoo.models.Model._rec_name`{.interpreted-text
role="attr"}.

::: exercise
Define a model

Define a new data model *Course* in the *openacademy* module. A course
has a title and a description. Courses must have a title.
:::

### Data files

Odoo is a highly data driven system. Although behavior is customized
using [Python](https://python.org) code part of a module\'s value is in
the data it sets up when loaded.

:::: {.tip .aphorism}
::: title
Tip
:::

some modules exist solely to add data into Odoo
::::

Module data is declared via
`data files <reference/data>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, XML files
with `<record>` elements. Each `<record>` element creates or updates a
database record.

``` xml
<odoo>

        <record model="{model name}" id="{record identifier}">
            <field name="{a field name}">{a value}</field>
        </record>

</odoo>
```

- `model` is the name of the Odoo model for the record.
- `id` is an `external identifier`{.interpreted-text role="term"}, it
  allows referring to the record (without having to know its in-database
  identifier).
- `<field>` elements have a `name` which is the name of the field in the
  model (e.g. `description`). Their body is the field\'s value.

Data files have to be declared in the manifest file to be loaded, they
can be declared in the `'data'` list (always loaded) or in the `'demo'`
list (only loaded in demonstration mode).

::: exercise
Define demonstration data

Create demonstration data filling the *Courses* model with a few
demonstration courses.
:::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The content of the data files is only loaded when a module is installed
or updated.

After making some changes, do not forget to use `odoo-bin -u openacademy
<reference/cmdline>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to save the changes
to your database.
::::

### Actions and Menus {#howtos/module/actions}

Actions and menus are regular records in database, usually declared
through data files. Actions can be triggered in three ways:

1.  by clicking on menu items (linked to specific actions)
2.  by clicking on buttons in views (if these are connected to actions)
3.  as contextual actions on object

Because menus are somewhat complex to declare there is a `<menuitem>`
shortcut to declare an `ir.ui.menu` and connect it to the corresponding
action more easily.

``` xml
<record model="ir.actions.act_window" id="action_list_ideas">
    <field name="name">Ideas</field>
    <field name="res_model">idea.idea</field>
    <field name="view_mode">list,form</field>
</record>
<menuitem id="menu_ideas" parent="menu_root" name="Ideas" sequence="10"
          action="action_list_ideas"/>
```

:::: {.danger .aphorism}
::: title
Danger
:::

The action must be declared before its corresponding menu in the XML
file.

Data files are executed sequentially, the action\'s `id` must be present
in the database before the menu can be created.
::::

::: exercise
Define new menu entries

Define new menu entries to access courses under the OpenAcademy menu
entry. A user should be able to:

- display a list of all the courses
- create/modify courses
:::

## Basic views

Views define the way the records of a model are displayed. Each type of
view represents a mode of visualization (a list of records, a graph of
their aggregation, ...). Views can either be requested generically via
their type (e.g. *a list of partners*) or specifically via their id. For
generic requests, the view with the correct type and the lowest priority
will be used (so the lowest-priority view of each type is the default
view for that type).

`View inheritance <reference/view_records/inheritance>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} allows altering views declared elsewhere (adding or removing
content).

### Generic view declaration

A view is declared as a record of the model `ir.ui.view`. The view type
is implied by the root element of the `arch` field:

``` xml
<record model="ir.ui.view" id="view_id">
    <field name="name">view.name</field>
    <field name="model">object_name</field>
    <field name="priority" eval="16"/>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <!-- view content: <form>, <list>, <graph>, ... -->
    </field>
</record>
```

:::: {.danger .aphorism}
::: title
Danger
:::

The view\'s content is XML.

The `arch` field must thus be declared as `type="xml"` to be parsed
correctly.
::::

### list views

list views, also called list views, display records in a tabular form.

Their root element is `<list>`. The simplest form of the list view
simply lists all the fields to display in the table (each field as a
column):

``` xml
<list string="Idea list">
    <field name="name"/>
    <field name="inventor_id"/>
</list>
```

### Form views {#howtos/module/views/form}

Forms are used to create and edit single records.

Their root element is `<form>`. They are composed of high-level
structure elements (groups, notebooks) and interactive elements (buttons
and fields):

``` xml
<form string="Idea form">
    <group colspan="4">
        <group colspan="2" col="2">
            <separator string="General stuff" colspan="2"/>
            <field name="name"/>
            <field name="inventor_id"/>
        </group>

        <group colspan="2" col="2">
            <separator string="Dates" colspan="2"/>
            <field name="active"/>
            <field name="invent_date" readonly="1"/>
        </group>

        <notebook colspan="4">
            <page string="Description">
                <field name="description" nolabel="1"/>
            </page>
        </notebook>

        <field name="state"/>
    </group>
</form>
```

::: exercise
Customise form view using XML

be: the name and the description of the course.
:::

::: exercise
Notebooks

In the Course form view, put the description field under a tab, such
that it will be easier to add other tabs later, containing additional
information.
:::

Form views can also use plain HTML for more flexible layouts:

``` xml
<form string="Idea Form">
    <header>
        <button string="Confirm" type="object" name="action_confirm"
                invisible="state != 'draft'" class="oe_highlight" />
        <button string="Mark as done" type="object" name="action_done"
                invisible="state != 'confirmed'" class="oe_highlight"/>
        <button string="Reset to draft" type="object" name="action_draft"
                invisible="state not in ['confirmed', 'done']" />
        <field name="state" widget="statusbar"/>
    </header>
    <sheet>
        <div class="oe_title">
            <label for="name" class="oe_edit_only" string="Idea Name" />
            <h1><field name="name" /></h1>
        </div>
        <separator string="General" colspan="2" />
        <group colspan="2" col="2">
            <field name="description" placeholder="Idea description..." />
        </group>
    </sheet>
</form>
```

### Search views

Search views customize the search field associated with the list view
(and other aggregated views). Their root element is `<search>` and
they\'re composed of fields defining which fields can be searched on:

``` xml
<search>
    <field name="name"/>
    <field name="inventor_id"/>
</search>
```

If no search view exists for the model, Odoo generates one which only
allows searching on the `name` field.

::: exercise
Search courses

Allow searching for courses based on their title or their description.
:::

## Relations between models

A record from a model may be related to a record from another model. For
instance, a sale order record is related to a client record that
contains the client data; it is also related to its sale order line
records.

::: exercise
Create a session model

For the module Open Academy, we consider a model for *sessions*: a
session is an occurrence of a course taught at a given time for a given
audience.

Create a model for *sessions*. A session has a name, a start date, a
duration and a number of seats. Add an action and a menu item to display
them. Make the new model visible via a menu item.
:::

### Relational fields

Relational fields link records, either of the same model (hierarchies)
or between different models.

Relational field types are:

`Many2one(other_model, ondelete='set null') <odoo.fields.Many2one>`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

:   A simple link to an other object:

        print(foo.other_id.name)

    ::: seealso
    [foreign
    keys](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/tutorial-fk.html)
    :::

`One2many(other_model, related_field) <odoo.fields.One2many>`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

:   A virtual relationship, inverse of a
    `~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"}. A
    `~odoo.fields.One2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"} behaves as a
    container of records, accessing it results in a (possibly empty) set
    of records:

        for other in foo.other_ids:
            print(other.name)

    :::: danger
    ::: title
    Danger
    :::

    Because a `~odoo.fields.One2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"} is
    a virtual relationship, there *must* be a
    `~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"} field in the
    `{other_model}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}, and its name *must*
    be `{related_field}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}
    ::::

`Many2many(other_model) <odoo.fields.Many2many>`{.interpreted-text role="class"}

:   Bidirectional multiple relationship, any record on one side can be
    related to any number of records on the other side. Behaves as a
    container of records, accessing it also results in a possibly empty
    set of records:

        for other in foo.other_ids:
            print(other.name)

::: exercise
Many2one relations

Using a many2one, modify the *Course* and *Session* models to reflect
their relation with other models:

- A course has a *responsible* user; the value of that field is a record
  of the built-in model `res.users`.
- A session has an *instructor*; the value of that field is a record of
  the built-in model `res.partner`.
- A session is related to a *course*; the value of that field is a
  record of the model `openacademy.course` and is required.
- Adapt the views.

## Inheritance

### Model inheritance

Odoo provides two *inheritance* mechanisms to extend an existing model
in a modular way.

The first inheritance mechanism allows a module to modify the behavior
of a model defined in another module:

- add fields to a model,
- override the definition of fields on a model,
- add constraints to a model,
- add methods to a model,
- override existing methods on a model.

The second inheritance mechanism (delegation) allows to link every
record of a model to a record in a parent model, and provides
transparent access to the fields of the parent record.

:::

### View inheritance

Instead of modifying existing views in place (by overwriting them), Odoo
provides view inheritance where children \"extension\" views are applied
on top of root views, and can add or remove content from their parent.

An extension view references its parent using the `inherit_id` field,
and instead of a single view its `arch` field is composed of any number
of `xpath` elements selecting and altering the content of their parent
view:

``` xml
<!-- improved idea categories list -->
<record id="idea_category_list2" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">id.category.list2</field>
    <field name="model">idea.category</field>
    <field name="inherit_id" ref="id_category_list"/>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <!-- find field description and add the field
             idea_ids after it -->
        <xpath expr="//field[@name='description']" position="after">
          <field name="idea_ids" string="Number of ideas"/>
        </xpath>
    </field>
</record>
```

`expr`

:   An [XPath](https://w3.org/TR/xpath) expression selecting a single
    element in the parent view. Raises an error if it matches no element
    or more than one

`position`

:   Operation to apply to the matched element:

    `inside`

    :   appends `xpath`\'s body at the end of the matched element

    `replace`

    :   replaces the matched element with the `xpath`\'s body, replacing
        any `$0` node occurrence in the new body with the original
        element

    `before`

    :   inserts the `xpath`\'s body as a sibling before the matched
        element

    `after`

    :   inserts the `xpaths`\'s body as a sibling after the matched
        element

    `attributes`

    :   alters the attributes of the matched element using special
        `attribute` elements in the `xpath`\'s body

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

When matching a single element, the `position` attribute can be set
directly on the element to be found. Both inheritances below will give
the same result.

``` xml
<xpath expr="//field[@name='description']" position="after">
    <field name="idea_ids" />
</xpath>

<field name="description" position="after">
    <field name="idea_ids" />
</field>
```
::::

::: exercise
Alter existing content

- Using model inheritance, modify the existing *Partner* model to add an
  `instructor` boolean field, and a many2many field that corresponds to
  the session-partner relation
- Using view inheritance, display this fields in the partner form view
:::

#### Domains

In Odoo, `reference/orm/domains`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are
values that encode conditions on records. A domain is a list of criteria
used to select a subset of a model\'s records. Each criteria is a triple
with a field name, an operator and a value.

For instance, when used on the *Product* model the following domain
selects all *services* with a unit price over *1000*:

    [('product_type', '=', 'service'), ('unit_price', '>', 1000)]

By default criteria are combined with an implicit AND. The logical
operators `&` (AND), `|` (OR) and `!` (NOT) can be used to explicitly
combine criteria. They are used in prefix position (the operator is
inserted before its arguments rather than between). For instance to
select products \"which are services *OR* have a unit price which is
*NOT* between 1000 and 2000\":

    ['|',
        ('product_type', '=', 'service'),
        '!', '&',
            ('unit_price', '>=', 1000),
            ('unit_price', '<', 2000)]

A `domain` parameter can be added to relational fields to limit valid
records for the relation when trying to select records in the client
interface.

::: exercise
Domains on relational fields

When selecting the instructor for a *Session*, only instructors
(partners with `instructor` set to `True`) should be visible.
:::

::: exercise
More complex domains

Create new partner categories *Teacher / Level 1* and *Teacher / Level
2*. The instructor for a session can be either an instructor or a
teacher (of any level).
:::

## Computed fields and default values

So far fields have been stored directly in and retrieved directly from
the database. Fields can also be *computed*. In that case, the field\'s
value is not retrieved from the database but computed on-the-fly by
calling a method of the model.

To create a computed field, create a field and set its attribute
`~odoo.fields.Field.compute`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} to the name
of a method. The computation method should simply set the value of the
field to compute on every record in `self`.

:::: {.danger .aphorism}
::: title
Danger
:::

`self` is a collection

The object `self` is a *recordset*, i.e., an ordered collection of
records. It supports the standard Python operations on collections, like
`len(self)` and `iter(self)`, plus extra set operations like
`recs1 + recs2`.

Iterating over `self` gives the records one by one, where each record is
itself a collection of size 1. You can access/assign fields on single
records by using the dot notation, like `record.name`.
::::

``` python
import random
from odoo import models, fields, api

class ComputedModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'test.computed'

    name = fields.Char(compute='_compute_name')

    def _compute_name(self):
        for record in self:
            record.name = str(random.randint(1, 1e6))
```

### Dependencies

The value of a computed field usually depends on the values of other
fields on the computed record. The ORM expects the developer to specify
those dependencies on the compute method with the decorator
`~odoo.api.depends`{.interpreted-text role="func"}. The given
dependencies are used by the ORM to trigger the recomputation of the
field whenever some of its dependencies have been modified:

    from odoo import models, fields, api

    class ComputedModel(models.Model):
        _name = 'test.computed'

        name = fields.Char(compute='_compute_name')
        value = fields.Integer()

        @api.depends('value')
        def _compute_name(self):
            for record in self:
                record.name = "Record with value %s" % record.value

::: exercise
Computed fields

- Add the percentage of taken seats to the *Session* model
- Display that field in the list and form views
- Display the field as a progress bar
:::

### Default values

Any field can be given a default value. In the field definition, add the
option `default=X` where `X` is either a Python literal value (boolean,
integer, float, string), or a function taking a recordset and returning
a value:

    name = fields.Char(default="Unknown")
    user_id = fields.Many2one('res.users', default=lambda self: self.env.user)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The object `self.env` gives access to request parameters and other
useful things:

- `self.env.cr` or `self._cr` is the database *cursor* object; it is
  used for querying the database
- `self.env.uid` or `self._uid` is the current user\'s database id
- `self.env.user` is the current user\'s record
- `self.env.context` or `self._context` is the context dictionary
- `self.env.ref(xml_id)` returns the record corresponding to an XML id
- `self.env[model_name]` returns an instance of the given model
::::

::: exercise
Active objects -- Default values

- Define the start_date default value as today (see
  `~odoo.fields.Date`{.interpreted-text role="class"}).
- Add a field `active` in the class Session, and set sessions as active
  by default.
:::

## Onchange

The \"onchange\" mechanism provides a way for the client interface to
update a form whenever the user has filled in a value in a field,
without saving anything to the database.

For instance, suppose a model has three fields `amount`, `unit_price`
and `price`, and you want to update the price on the form when any of
the other fields is modified. To achieve this, define a method where
`self` represents the record in the form view, and decorate it with
`~odoo.api.onchange`{.interpreted-text role="func"} to specify on which
field it has to be triggered. Any change you make on `self` will be
reflected on the form.

``` xml
<!-- content of form view -->
<field name="amount"/>
<field name="unit_price"/>
<field name="price" readonly="1"/>
```

``` python
# onchange handler
@api.onchange('amount', 'unit_price')
def _onchange_price(self):
    # set auto-changing field
    self.price = self.amount * self.unit_price
    # Can optionally return a warning and domains
    return {
        'warning': {
            'title': "Something bad happened",
            'message': "It was very bad indeed",
        }
    }
```

For computed fields, valued `onchange` behavior is built-in as can be
seen by playing with the *Session* form: change the number of seats or
participants, and the `taken_seats` progressbar is automatically
updated.

::: exercise
Warning

Add an explicit onchange to warn about invalid values, like a negative
number of seats, or more participants than seats.
:::

## Model constraints

Odoo provides two ways to set up automatically verified invariants:
`Python constraints <odoo.api.constrains>`{.interpreted-text
role="func"} and
`SQL constraints <odoo.models.Constraint>`{.interpreted-text
role="attr"}. In a similar way, you can add more complex
`SQL indexes <odoo.models.Index>`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}.

A Python constraint is defined as a method decorated with
`~odoo.api.constrains`{.interpreted-text role="func"}, and invoked on a
recordset. The decorator specifies which fields are involved in the
constraint, so that the constraint is automatically evaluated when one
of them is modified. The method is expected to raise an exception if its
invariant is not satisfied:

    from odoo.exceptions import ValidationError

    @api.constrains('age')
    def _check_something(self):
        for record in self:
            if record.age > 20:
                raise ValidationError("Your record is too old: %s" % record.age)
        # all records passed the test, don't return anything

::: exercise
Add Python constraints

Add a constraint that checks that the instructor is not present in the
attendees of his/her own session.
:::

Constraints and indexes are defined using:
`~odoo.models.Constraint`{.interpreted-text role="attr"},
`~odoo.models.Index`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} and
`~odoo.models.UniqueIndex`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}.

::: exercise
Add SQL constraints

documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/ddl-constraints.html)
, add the following constraints:

1.  CHECK that the course description and the course title are different
2.  Make the Course\'s name UNIQUE
:::

::: exercise
Exercise 6 - Add a duplicate option

Since we added a constraint for the Course name uniqueness, it is not
possible to use the \"duplicate\" function anymore (`Form -->
Duplicate`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}).

Re-implement your own \"copy\" method which allows to duplicate the
Course object, changing the original name into \"Copy of \[original
name\]\".
:::

## Advanced Views

### list views

list views can take supplementary attributes to further customize their
behavior:

`decoration-{$name}`

:   allow changing the style of a row\'s text based on the corresponding
    record\'s attributes.

    Values are Python expressions. For each record, the expression is
    evaluated with the record\'s attributes as context values and if
    `true`, the corresponding style is applied to the row. Here are some
    of the other values available in the context:

    - `uid`: the id of the current user,
    - `today`: the current local date as a string of the form
      `YYYY-MM-DD`,
    - `now`: same as `today` with the addition of the current time. This
      value is formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`.

    `{$name}` can be `bf` (`font-weight: bold`), `it`
    (`font-style: italic`), or any [bootstrap contextual
    color](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#available-variations)
    (`danger`, `info`, `muted`, `primary`, `success` or `warning`).

    ``` xml
    <list string="Idea Categories" decoration-info="state=='draft'"
        decoration-danger="state=='trashed'">
        <field name="name"/>
        <field name="state"/>
    </list>
    ```

`editable`

:   Either `"top"` or `"bottom"`. Makes the list view editable in-place
    (rather than having to go through the form view), the value is the
    position where new rows appear.

::: exercise
List coloring

Modify the Session list view in such a way that sessions lasting less
than 5 days are colored blue, and the ones lasting more than 15 days are
colored red.
:::

### Calendars

Displays records as calendar events. Their root element is `<calendar>`
and their most common attributes are:

`color`

:   The name of the field used for *color segmentation*. Colors are
    automatically distributed to events, but events in the same color
    segment (records which have the same value for their `@color` field)
    will be given the same color.

`date_start`

:   record\'s field holding the start date/time for the event

`date_stop` (optional)

:     record\'s field holding the end date/time for the event

`string`

:   record\'s field to define the label for each calendar event

``` xml
<calendar string="Ideas" date_start="invent_date" color="inventor_id">
    <field name="name"/>
</calendar>
```

::: exercise
Calendar view

Add a Calendar view to the *Session* model enabling the user to view the
events associated to the Open Academy.
:::

### Search views

Search view `<field>` elements can have a `@filter_domain` that
overrides the domain generated for searching on the given field. In the
given domain, `self` represents the value entered by the user. In the
example below, it is used to search on both fields `name` and
`description`.

Search views can also contain `<filter>` elements, which act as toggles
for predefined searches. Filters must have one of the following
attributes:

`domain`

:   add the given domain to the current search

`context`

:   add some context to the current search; use the key `group_by` to
    group results on the given field name

``` xml
<search string="Ideas">
    <field name="name"/>
    <field name="description" string="Name and description"
           filter_domain="['|', ('name', 'ilike', self), ('description', 'ilike', self)]"/>
    <field name="inventor_id"/>
    <field name="country_id" widget="selection"/>

    <filter name="my_ideas" string="My Ideas"
            domain="[('inventor_id', '=', uid)]"/>
    <group string="Group By">
        <filter name="group_by_inventor" string="Inventor"
                context="{'group_by': 'inventor_id'}"/>
    </group>
</search>
```

To use a non-default search view in an action, it should be linked using
the `search_view_id` field of the action record.

The action can also set default values for search fields through its
`context` field: context keys of the form
`search_default_{field_name}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"} will
initialize *field_name* with the provided value. Search filters must
have an optional `@name` to have a default and behave as booleans (they
can only be enabled by default).

::: exercise
Search views

1.  Add a button to filter the courses for which the current user is the
    responsible in the course search view. Make it selected by default.
2.  Add a button to group courses by responsible user.

### Gantt

:::: warning

:::

The gantt view requires the web_gantt module which is present in the
`enterprise edition
<install/editions>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} version.
::::

Horizontal bar charts typically used to show project planning and
advancement, their root element is `<gantt>`.

``` xml
<gantt string="Ideas"
       date_start="invent_date"
       date_stop="date_finished"
       progress="progress"
       default_group_by="inventor_id" />

### Graph views

Graph views allow aggregated overview and analysis of models, their root
element is `<graph>`.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Pivot views (element `<pivot>`) a multidimensional table, allows the
selection of filers and dimensions to get the right aggregated dataset
before moving to a more graphical overview. The pivot view shares the
same content definition as graph views.
::::

Graph views have 4 display modes, the default mode is selected using the
`@type` attribute.

Bar (default)

:   a bar chart, the first dimension is used to define groups on the
    horizontal axis, other dimensions define aggregated bars within each
    group.

    By default bars are side-by-side, they can be stacked by using
    `@stacked="True"` on the `<graph>`

Line

:   2-dimensional line chart

Pie

:   2-dimensional pie

Graph views contain `<field>` with a mandatory `@type` attribute taking
the values:

`row` (default)

:   the field should be aggregated by default

`measure`

:   the field should be aggregated rather than grouped on

``` xml
<graph string="Total idea score by Inventor">
    <field name="inventor_id"/>
    <field name="score" type="measure"/>
</graph>
```

:::: warning

Graph view

Add a Graph view in the Session object that displays, for each course,
the number of attendees under the form of a bar chart.
:::

### Kanban

Used to organize tasks, production processes, etc... their root element
is `<kanban>`.

A kanban view shows a set of cards possibly grouped in columns. Each
card represents a record, and each column the values of an aggregation
field.

For instance, project tasks may be organized by stage (each column is a
stage), or by responsible (each column is a user), and so on.

Kanban views define the structure of each card as a mix of form elements
(including basic HTML) and `reference/qweb`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

::: exercise
Kanban view

Add a Kanban view that displays sessions grouped by course (columns are
thus courses).
:::

## Security

Access control mechanisms must be configured to achieve a coherent
security policy.

### Group-based access control mechanisms

Groups are created as normal records on the model `res.groups`, and
granted menu access via menu definitions. However even without a menu,
objects may still be accessible indirectly, so actual object-level
permissions (read, write, create, unlink) must be defined for groups.
They are usually inserted via CSV files inside modules. It is also
possible to restrict access to specific fields on a view or object using
the field\'s groups attribute.

### Access rights

Access rights are defined as records of the model `ir.model.access`.
Each access right is associated to a model, a group (or no group for
global access), and a set of permissions: read, write, create, unlink.
Such access rights are usually created by a CSV file named after its
model: `ir.model.access.csv`.

``` text
id,name,model_id/id,group_id/id,perm_read,perm_write,perm_create,perm_unlink
access_idea_idea,idea.idea,model_idea_idea,base.group_user,1,1,1,0
access_idea_vote,idea.vote,model_idea_vote,base.group_user,1,1,1,0
```

::: exercise
Add access control through the Odoo interface

Create a new user \"John Smith\". Then create a group \"OpenAcademy /
Session Read\" with read access to the *Session* model.
:::

::: exercise
Add access control through data files in your module

Using data files,

- Create a group *OpenAcademy / Manager* with full access to all
  OpenAcademy models
- Make *Session* and *Course* readable by all users
:::

### Record rules

A record rule restricts the access rights to a subset of records of the
given model. A rule is a record of the model `ir.rule`, and is
associated to a model, a number of groups (many2many field), permissions
to which the restriction applies, and a domain. The domain specifies to
which records the access rights are limited.

Here is an example of a rule that prevents the deletion of leads that
are not in state `cancel`. Notice that the value of the field `groups`
must follow the same convention as the method
`~odoo.models.Model.write`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} of the ORM.

``` xml
<record id="delete_cancelled_only" model="ir.rule">
    <field name="name">Only cancelled leads may be deleted</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="crm.model_crm_lead"/>
    <field name="groups" eval="[(4, ref('sales_team.group_sale_manager'))]"/>
    <field name="perm_read" eval="0"/>
    <field name="perm_write" eval="0"/>
    <field name="perm_create" eval="0"/>
    <field name="perm_unlink" eval="1" />
    <field name="domain_force">[('state','=','cancel')]</field>
</record>
```

::: exercise
Record rule

Add a record rule for the model Course and the group \"OpenAcademy /
Manager\", that restricts `write` and `unlink` accesses to the
responsible of a course. If a course has no responsible, all users of
the group must be able to modify it.

## Wizards {#howto/module/wizard}

Wizards describe interactive sessions with the user (or dialog boxes)
through dynamic forms. A wizard is simply a model that extends the class
`~odoo.models.TransientModel`{.interpreted-text role="class"} instead of
`~odoo.models.Model`{.interpreted-text role="class"}. The class
`~odoo.models.TransientModel`{.interpreted-text role="class"} extends
`~odoo.models.Model`{.interpreted-text role="class"} and reuse all its
existing mechanisms, with the following particularities:

- Wizard records are not meant to be persistent; they are automatically
  deleted from the database after a certain time. This is why they are
  called *transient*.
- Wizard records may refer to regular records or wizard records through
  relational fields(many2one or many2many), but regular records *cannot*
  refer to wizard records through a many2one field.

We want to create a wizard that allow users to create attendees for a
particular session, or for a list of sessions at once.

::: exercise
Define the wizard

Create a wizard model with a many2one relationship with the *Session*
model and a many2many relationship with the *Partner* model.
:::

### Launching wizards

Wizards are simply
`window actions <howtos/module/actions>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
with a `target` field set to the value `new`, which opens the view
(usually `a form <howtos/module/views/form>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}) in a separate dialog. The action may be triggered via a
menu item, but is more generally triggered by a button.

An other way to launch wizards is through the `Action`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} menu of a list or form view. This is done through
the `binding_model_id` field of the action. Setting this field will make
the action appear on the views of the model the action is \"bound\" to.

``` xml
<record id="launch_the_wizard" model="ir.actions.act_window">
    <field name="name">Launch the Wizard</field>
    <field name="res_model">wizard.model.name</field>
    <field name="view_mode">form</field>
    <field name="target">new</field>
    <field name="binding_model_id" ref="model_context_model_ref"/>
</record>
```

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

While wizards use regular views and buttons, normally clicking any
button in a form would first save the form then close the dialog.
Because this is often undesirable in wizards, a special attribute
`special="cancel"` is available which immediately closes the wizard
without saving the form.
::::

::: exercise
Launch the wizard

1.  Define a form view for the wizard.
2.  Add the action to launch it in the context of the *Session* model.
3.  Define a default value for the session field in the wizard; use the

## Internationalization

Each module can provide its own translations within the i18n directory,
by having files named LANG.po where LANG is the locale code for the
language, or the language and country combination when they differ (e.g.
pt.po or pt_BR.po). Translations will be loaded automatically by Odoo
for all enabled languages. Developers always use English when creating a
module, then export the module terms using Odoo\'s gettext POT export
feature (`Settings --> Translations --> Import/Export --> Export
Translation`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} without specifying
a language), to create the module template POT file, and then derive the
translated PO files. Many IDE\'s have plugins or modes for editing and
merging PO/POT files.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The Portable Object files generated by Odoo are published on [Odoo\'s
Translations Platform](https://translate.odoo.com/), making it easy to
translate the software.
::::

``` text
|- idea/ # The module directory
   |- i18n/ # Translation files

      | (...)
```

:::: tip

Tip
:::

By default Odoo\'s POT export only extracts labels inside XML files or
inside field definitions in Python code, but any Python string can be
translated this way by surrounding it with the function
`odoo._`{.interpreted-text role="func"} (e.g. `_("Label")`)

## Reporting

### Printed reports

Odoo uses a report engine based on `reference/qweb`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and
[Wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org).

A report is a combination two elements:

- an `ir.actions.report` which configures various basic parameters for
  the report (default type, whether the report should be saved to the
  database after generation,...)

  ``` xml
  <record id="account_invoices" model="ir.actions.report">
      <field name="name">Invoices</field>
      <field name="model">account.invoice</field>
      <field name="report_type">qweb-pdf</field>
      <field name="report_name">account.report_invoice</field>
      <field name="report_file">account.report_invoice</field>
      <field name="attachment_use" eval="True"/>
      <field name="attachment">(object.state in ('open','paid')) and
          ('INV'+(object.number or '').replace('/','')+'.pdf')</field>
      <field name="binding_model_id" ref="model_account_invoice"/>
      <field name="binding_type">report</field>
  </record>
  ```

  :::: tip
  ::: title
  Tip
  :::

  Because it largerly a standard action, as with
  `howto/module/wizard`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} it is generally
  useful to add the report as a *contextual item* on the list and / or
  form views of the model being reported on via the `binding_model_id`
  field.

  Here we are also using `binding_type` in order for the report to be in
  the *report* contextual menu rather than the *action* one. There is no
  technical difference but putting elements in the right place helps
  users.
  ::::

- A standard
  `QWeb view <reference/view_architectures/qweb>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} for the actual report:

  ``` xml
  <t t-call="web.html_container">
      <t t-foreach="docs" t-as="o">
          <t t-call="web.external_layout">
              <div class="page">
                  <h2>Report title</h2>
              </div>
          </t>
      </t>
  </t>
  ```

  the standard rendering context provides a number of elements, the most
  important being:

  `docs`

  :   the records for which the report is printed

  `user`

  :   the user printing the report

Because reports are standard web pages, they are available through a URL
and output parameters can be manipulated through this URL, for instance
the HTML version of the *Invoice* report is available through
<http://localhost:8069/report/html/account.report_invoice/1> (if
`account` is installed) and the PDF version through
<http://localhost:8069/report/pdf/account.report_invoice/1>.

::::: {#reference/backend/reporting/printed-reports/pdf-without-styles}
:::: danger
::: title
Danger
:::

If it appears that your PDF report is missing the styles (i.e. the text
appears but the style/layout is different from the html version),
probably your [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org) process cannot
reach your web server to download them.

If you check your server logs and see that the CSS styles are not being
downloaded when generating a PDF report, most surely this is the
problem.

The [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org) process will use the
`web.base.url` system parameter as the *root path* to all linked files,
but this parameter is automatically updated each time the Administrator
is logged in. If your server resides behind some kind of proxy, that
could not be reachable. You can fix this by adding one of these system
parameters:

- `report.url`, pointing to an URL reachable from your server (probably
  `http://localhost:8069` or something similar). It will be used for
  this particular purpose only.
- `web.base.url.freeze`, when set to `True`, will stop the automatic
  updates to `web.base.url`.

# Define module data

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

This tutorial is an extension of the
`server_framework_101`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} tutorial. Make sure
you have completed it and use the [estate]{.title-ref} module you have
built as a base for the exercises in this tutorial.
::::

## Data Types

### Master Data

Master data is usually part of the technical or business requirements
for the module. In other words, such data is often necessary for the
module to work properly. This data will always be installed when
installing the module.

We already met technical data previously since we have defined `views
<../reference/user_interface/view_records>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and
`actions <../reference/backend/actions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
Those are one kind of master data.

On top of technical data, business data can be defined, e.g. countries,
currencies, units of measure, as well as complete country localization
(legal reports, tax definitions, chart of account), and much more\...

### Demo Data {#tutorials/define_module_data/demo_data}

In addition to master data, which is required for a module to work
properly, we can also provide data for demonstration purposes:

- Help the sales representatives make their demos quickly.
- Have a set of working data for developers to test new features and see
  how these new features look with data they might not have added
  themselves.
- Test that the data is loaded correctly, without raising an error.
- Setup most of the features to be used quickly when creating a new
  database.

The database manager let you create databases with demo data. The same
can be achieved via the command line with
`--with-demo <odoo-bin --with-demo>`{.interpreted-text role="option"}.

``` console
$ ./odoo-bin -h
Usage: odoo-bin [options]

Options:
--version             show program's version number and exit
-h, --help            show this help message and exit

Common options:
  [...]
  --with-demo         install demo data in new databases
[...]

$ ./odoo-bin --addons-path=... -d new-db -i base --with-demo
```

## Data Declaration

### Manifest

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`Module Manifests<reference/module/manifest>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Data is declared either in CSV or in XML. Each file containing data must
be added in the manifest for them to be loaded.

The keys to use in the manifest to add new data are `data` for the
master data and `demo` for the demo data. Both values should be a list
of strings representing the relative paths to the files declaring the
data.

Usually, demo data is in a `demo` folder, views and actions are in a
`views` folder, security related data is in a `security` folder, and
other data is in a `data` folder.

If your work tree looks like this:

``` bash
estate
├── data
│   └── master_data.xml
├── demo
│   └── demo_data.xml
├── models
│   ├── *.py
│   └── __init__.py
├── security
│   └── ir.model.access.csv
├── views
│   └── estate_property_offer_views.xml
├── __init__.py
└── __manifest__.py
```

Your manifest should look like this:

``` python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

{
    "name": "Real Estate",
    "depends": [
        ...
    ],
    "data": [
        "security/ir.model.access.csv",  # CSV and XML files are loaded at the same place
        "views/estate_property_offer_views.xml",  # Views are data too
        "data/master_data.xml",  # Split the data in multiple files depending on the model
    ],
    "demo": [
        "demo/demo_data.xml",
    ]
    "application": True,
}
```

### CSV

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`CSV data files<reference/data/csvdatafiles>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

The easiest way to declare simple data is by using the CSV format. This
is however limited in terms of features: use it for long lists of simple
models, but prefer XML otherwise.

``` text
id,field_a,field_b,related_id:id
id1,valueA1,valueB1,module.relatedid
id2,valueA2,valueB2,module.relatedid
```

:::: tip

### XML

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`Data Files<reference/data>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

When the data to create is more complex it can be useful, or even
necessary, to do it in XML.

``` xml
<odoo>
  <record id="id1" model="tutorial.example">
    <field name="field_a">valueA1</field>
    <field name="field_b">valueB1</field>

#### Data Extension

During the Core Training, we saw in the
`server_framework_101/12_inheritance`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
chapter we could inherit (extend) an existing view. This was a special
case of data extension: any data can be extended in a module.

When you are adding new fields to an existing model in a new module, you
might want to populate those fields on the records created in the
modules you are depending on. This is done by giving the
[xml_id]{.title-ref} of the record you want to extend. It won\'t replace
it, in this case we will set the `field_c` to the given value for both
records.

``` xml
<odoo>
  <record id="id1" model="tutorial.example">
    <field name="field_c">valueC1</field>
  </record>

  <record id="id2" model="tutorial.example">
    <field name="field_c">valueC2</field>
  </record>
</odoo>
```

#### `ref`

Related fields can be set using the `ref` key. The value of that key is
the `xml_id` of the record you want to link. Remember the `xml_id` is
composed of the name of the module where the data is first declared,
followed by a dot, followed by the `id` of the record (just the `id`
works too if you are in the module declaring it).

``` xml
<odoo>
  <record id="id1" model="tutorial.example">
    <field name="related_id" ref="module.relatedid"/>
  </record>
</odoo>
```

::: exercise
Create some demo data offers for the properties you created.

Create offers using the partners defined in `base`

  Partner          Estate      Price     Validity
  ---------------- ----------- --------- ----------
  Azure Interior   Big Villa   10000     14
  Azure Interior   Big Villa   1500000   14
  Deco Addict      Big Villa   1500001   14
:::

::: exercise
Ensure both of your demo properties are created with their Property Type
set to Residential.
:::

#### `eval`

The value to assign to a field is not always a simple string and you
might need to compute it. It can also be used to optimize the insertion
of related values, or because a constraint forces you to add the related
values in batch. See `Add X2many fields
<tutorials/define_module_data/x2m>`{.interpreted-text role=":ref"}.

``` xml
<odoo>
  <record id="id1" model="tutorial.example">
    <field name="year" eval="datetime.now().year+1"/>
  </record>
</odoo>
```

::: exercise
The offers you added should always be in a date relative to the
installation of the module.
:::

#### `search`

Sometimes, you need to call the ORM to do a `search`. This is not
feasible with the CSV format.

``` xml
<odoo>
  <record id="id1" model="account.move.line">
    <field name="account_id" search="[
      ('user_type_id', '=', ref('account.data_account_type_direct_costs')),
      ('company_id', '=', obj().env.company.id)]
    "/>
  </record>
</odoo>
```

In this code snippet, it is needed because the master data depends on
the localization installed.

#### `function`

You might also need to execute python code when loading data.

``` xml
<function model="tutorial.example" name="action_validate">
    <value eval="[ref('demo_invoice_1')]"/>
</function>
```

::: exercise
Validate one of the demo data offers by using the \"Accept Offer\"
button. Refuse the others.
:::

### Add X2many fields {#tutorials/define_module_data/x2m}

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`~odoo.fields.Command`{.interpreted-text role="class"}.

If you need to add related data in a One2many or a Many2many field, you
can do so by using the `~odoo.fields.Command`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} methods.

``` xml
<odoo>
  <record id="id1" model="tutorial.example">
    <field name="related_ids" eval="[
        Command.create({
            'name': 'My name',
        }),
        Command.create({
            'name': 'Your name',
        }),
        Command.link(ref('model.xml_id')),
    ]"/>
  </record>
</odoo>
```

::: exercise
Create one new Property, but this time with some offers created directly
inside the One2many field linked to the Offers.
:::

## Accessing the data

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

You should never access demo data outside of the demo data declaration,
not even in tests.
::::

There are multiple ways to access the master/demo data.

In python code, you can use the
`env.ref(self, xml_id, raise_if_not_found=True)` method. It returns the
recordset linked to the `xml_id` you specify.

In XML, you can use the [ref]{.title-ref} key like this

``` xml
<odoo>
  <record id="id1" model="tutorial.example">
    <field name="related_id" ref="module.relatedid"/>
  </record>
</odoo>
```

It will call the ref method, and store the id of the record returned on
the field `related_id` of the record of type `tutorial.example` with id
`id1`.

In CSV, the title of the column must be suffixed with `:id` or `/id`.

``` text
id,parent_id:id,name
"child1","module.parent","Name1"
"child2","module.parent","Name2"
"child3","module.parent","Name3"
```

In SQL, it is more complicated, see `the advanced section
<tutorials/define_module_data/xml_id>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Data can always be deleted by the user. Always code defensively, taking
this into account.
::::

## Advanced

### What is the XML id? {#tutorials/define_module_data/xml_id}

Because we don\'t want a column `xml_id` in every single SQL table of
the database, we need a mechanism to store it. This is done with the
`ir.model.data` model.

It contains the name of the record (the `xml_id`) along with the module
in which it is defined, the model defining it, and the id of it.

### No update

The records created with the `noupdate` flag won\'t be updated when
upgrading the module that created them, but it will be created if it
didn\'t exist yet.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`odoo-bin -i module` will bypass this setting and always load the data.
But normally one shouldn\'t do this on a production database.
::::

``` xml
<odoo noupdate="1">
  <record id="id1" model="model">
    <field name="fieldA" eval="True"/>
  </record>
</odoo>
```

### Import as SQL

In some cases, it makes sense to do the import directly in SQL. This is
however discouraged as it bypasses all the features of the ORM, computed
fields (including metadata) and python constraints.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Generally using raw SQL also bypasses ACLs and increases the risks of
injections.

**Reference**: `Security in Odoo<reference/security>`{.interpreted-text

- It can help to speed the import time by a lot [with huge
  files](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/blob/d46cceef8c594b9056d0115edb7169e207a5986f/product_unspsc/hooks.py#L19).

# Chapter 1: Owl components

This chapter introduces the [Owl
framework](https://github.com/odoo/owl), a tailor-made component system
for Odoo. The main building blocks of OWL are
[components]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/component.md) and
[templates]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/templates.md).

In Owl, every part of user interface is managed by a component: they
hold the logic and define the templates that are used to render the user
interface. In practice, a component is represented by a small JavaScript
class subclassing the [Component]{.title-ref} class.

To get started, you need a running Odoo server and a development
environment setup. Before getting into the exercises, make sure you have
followed all the steps described in this
`tutorial introduction <tutorials/discover_js_framework/setup>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If you use Chrome as your web browser, you can install the [Owl
Devtools]{.title-ref} extension. This extension provides many features
to help you understand and profile any Owl application.

[Video: How to use the
DevTools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUyQjwnrpzM)
::::

In this chapter, we use the [awesome_owl]{.title-ref} addon, which
provides a simplified environment that only contains Owl and a few other
files. The goal is to learn Owl itself, without relying on Odoo web
client code.

::: spoiler
Solutions

The solutions for each exercise of the chapter are hosted on the
[official Odoo tutorials
repository](https://github.com/odoo/tutorials/commits/{CURRENT_MAJOR_BRANCH}-discover-js-framework-solutions/awesome_owl).
It is recommended to try to solve them first without looking at the
solution!
:::

## Example: a [Counter]{.title-ref} component

First, let us have a look at a simple example. The [Counter]{.title-ref}
component shown below is a component that maintains an internal number
value, displays it, and updates it whenever the user clicks on the
button.

``` js
import { Component, useState } from "@odoo/owl";

export class Counter extends Component {
    static template = "my_module.Counter";

    setup() {
        this.state = useState({ value: 0 });
    }

    increment() {
        this.state.value++;
    }
}
```

The [Counter]{.title-ref} component specifies the name of a template
that represents its html. It is written in XML using the QWeb language:

``` xml
<templates xml:space="preserve">
   <t t-name="my_module.Counter">
      <p>Counter: <t t-esc="state.value"/></p>
      <button class="btn btn-primary" t-on-click="increment">Increment</button>
   </t>
</templates>
```

## 1. Displaying a counter

![image](01_owl_components/counter.png){.align-center}

As a first exercise, let us modify the [Playground]{.title-ref}
component located in `awesome_owl/static/src/`{.interpreted-text
role="file"} to turn it into a counter. To see the result, you can go to
the [/awesome_owl]{.title-ref} route with your browser.

1.  Modify `playground.js`{.interpreted-text role="file"} so that it
    acts as a counter like in the example above. Keep
    [Playground]{.title-ref} for the class name. You will need to use
    the [useState hook]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/hooks.md#usestate) so
    that the component is re-rendered whenever any part of the state
    object that has been read by this component is modified.
2.  In the same component, create an [increment]{.title-ref} method.
3.  Modify the template in `playground.xml`{.interpreted-text
    role="file"} so that it displays your counter variable. Use
    [t-esc]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/templates.md#outputting-data) to
    output the data.
4.  Add a button in the template and specify a
    [t-on-click]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/event_handling.md#event-handling)
    attribute in the button to trigger the [increment]{.title-ref}
    method whenever the button is clicked.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The Odoo JavaScript files downloaded by the browser are minified. For
debugging purpose, it\'s easier when the files are not minified. Switch
to `debug mode with assets
<developer-mode/activation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} so that the
files are not minified.
::::

This exercise showcases an important feature of Owl: the [reactivity
system]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/reactivity.md). The
[useState]{.title-ref} function wraps a value in a proxy so Owl can keep
track of which component needs which part of the state, so it can be
updated whenever a value has been changed. Try removing the
[useState]{.title-ref} function and see what happens.

## 2. Extract [Counter]{.title-ref} in a sub component

For now we have the logic of a counter in the [Playground]{.title-ref}
component, but it is not reusable. Let us see how to create a
[sub-component]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/component.md#sub-components)
from it:

1.  Extract the counter code from the [Playground]{.title-ref} component
    into a new [Counter]{.title-ref} component.
2.  You can do it in the same file first, but once it\'s done, update
    your code to move the [Counter]{.title-ref} in its own folder and
    file. Import it relatively from [./counter/counter]{.title-ref}.
    Make sure the template is in its own file, with the same name.
3.  Use [\<Counter/\>]{.title-ref} in the template of the
    [Playground]{.title-ref} component to add two counters in your
    playground.

![image](01_owl_components/double_counter.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

By convention, most components code, template and css should have the
same snake-cased name as the component. For example, if we have a
[TodoList]{.title-ref} component, its code should be in
[todo_list.js]{.title-ref}, [todo_list.xml]{.title-ref} and if
necessary, [todo_list.scss]{.title-ref}
::::

## 3. A simple [Card]{.title-ref} component {#tutorials/discover_js_framework/simple_card}

Components are really the most natural way to divide a complicated user
interface into multiple reusable pieces. But to make them truly useful,
it is necessary to be able to communicate some information between them.
Let us see how a parent component can provide information to a sub
component by using attributes (most commonly known as
[props]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/props.md)).

The goal of this exercise is to create a [Card]{.title-ref} component,
that takes two props: [title]{.title-ref} and [content]{.title-ref}. For
example, here is how it could be used:

``` xml
<Card title="'my title'" content="'some content'"/>
```

The above example should produce some html using bootstrap that look
like this:

``` html
<div class="card d-inline-block m-2" style="width: 18rem;">
    <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">my title</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
         some content
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
```

1.  Create a [Card]{.title-ref} component
2.  Import it in [Playground]{.title-ref} and display a few cards in its
    template

![image](01_owl_components/simple_card.png){.align-center}

## 4. Using [markup]{.title-ref} to display html

If you used [t-esc]{.title-ref} in the previous exercise, then you may
have noticed that Owl automatically escapes its content. For example, if
you try to display some html like this: [\<Card title=\"\'my title\'\"
content=\"this.html\"/\>]{.title-ref} with [this.html = \"\<div\>some
content\</div\>\"\"]{.title-ref}, the resulting output will simply
display the html as a string.

In this case, since the [Card]{.title-ref} component may be used to
display any kind of content, it makes sense to allow the user to display
some html. This is done with the [t-out
directive]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/templates.md#outputting-data).

However, displaying arbitrary content as html is dangerous, it could be
used to inject malicious code, so by default, Owl will always escape a
string unless it has been explicitely marked as safe with the
[markup]{.title-ref} function.

1.  Update [Card]{.title-ref} to use [t-out]{.title-ref}
2.  Update [Playground]{.title-ref} to import [markup]{.title-ref}, and
    use it on some html values
3.  Make sure that you see that normal strings are always escaped,
    unlike markuped strings.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The [t-esc]{.title-ref} directive can still be used in Owl templates. It
is slightly faster than [t-out]{.title-ref}.

## 5. Props validation

The [Card]{.title-ref} component has an implicit API. It expects to
receive two strings in its props: the [title]{.title-ref} and the
[content]{.title-ref}. Let us make that API more explicit. We can add a
props definition that will let Owl perform a validation step in [dev
mode]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/app.md#dev-mode). You can activate the
dev mode in the [App
configuration]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/app.md#configuration) (but it is
activated by default on the [awesome_owl]{.title-ref} playground).

It is a good practice to do props validation for every component.

1.  Add [props
    validation]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/props.md#props-validation) to
    the [Card]{.title-ref} component.
2.  Rename the [title]{.title-ref} props into something else in the
    playground template, then check in the `Console`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} tab of your browser\'s dev tools that you can see
    an error.

## 6. The sum of two [Counter]{.title-ref}

We saw in a previous exercise that [props]{.title-ref} can be used to
provide information from a parent to a child component. Now, let us see
how we can communicate information in the opposite direction: in this
exercise, we want to display two [Counter]{.title-ref} components, and
below them, the sum of their values. So, the parent component
([Playground]{.title-ref}) need to be informed whenever one of the
[Counter]{.title-ref} value is changed.

This can be done by using a [callback
prop]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/props.md#binding-function-props): a prop
that is a function meant to be called back. The child component can
choose to call that function with any argument. In our case, we will
simply add an optional [onChange]{.title-ref} prop that will be called
whenever the [Counter]{.title-ref} component is incremented.

1.  Add prop validation to the [Counter]{.title-ref} component: it
    should accept an optional [onChange]{.title-ref} function prop.
2.  Update the [Counter]{.title-ref} component to call the
    [onChange]{.title-ref} prop (if it exists) whenever it is
    incremented.
3.  Modify the [Playground]{.title-ref} component to maintain a local
    state value ([sum]{.title-ref}), initially set to 2, and display it
    in its template
4.  Implement an [incrementSum]{.title-ref} method in
    [Playground]{.title-ref}
5.  Give that method as a prop to two (or more!) sub
    [Counter]{.title-ref} components.

![image](01_owl_components/sum_counter.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title
Important

There is a subtlety with callback props: they usually should be defined
with the [.bind]{.title-ref} suffix. See the
[documentation]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/props.md#binding-function-props).
::::

## 7. A todo list

Let us now discover various features of Owl by creating a todo list. We
need two components: a [TodoList]{.title-ref} component that will
display a list of [TodoItem]{.title-ref} components. The list of todos
is a state that should be maintained by the [TodoList]{.title-ref}.

For this tutorial, a [todo]{.title-ref} is an object that contains three
values: an [id]{.title-ref} (number), a [description]{.title-ref}
(string) and a flag [isCompleted]{.title-ref} (boolean):

``` js
{ id: 3, description: "buy milk", isCompleted: false }
```

1.  Create a [TodoList]{.title-ref} and a [TodoItem]{.title-ref}
    components.

2.  The [TodoItem]{.title-ref} component should receive a
    [todo]{.title-ref} as a prop, and display its [id]{.title-ref} and
    [description]{.title-ref} in a [div]{.title-ref}.

3.  For now, hardcode the list of todos:

    ``` js
    // in TodoList
    this.todos = useState([{ id: 3, description: "buy milk", isCompleted: false }]);
    ```

4.  Use [t-foreach]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/templates.md#loops) to
    display each todo in a [TodoItem]{.title-ref}.

5.  Display a [TodoList]{.title-ref} in the playground.

6.  Add props validation to [TodoItem]{.title-ref}.

![image](01_owl_components/todo_list.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Since the [TodoList]{.title-ref} and [TodoItem]{.title-ref} components
are so tightly coupled, it makes sense to put them in the same folder.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The [t-foreach]{.title-ref} directive is not exactly the same in Owl as
the QWeb python implementation: it requires a [t-key]{.title-ref} unique
value, so that Owl can properly reconcile each element.
::::

## 8. Use dynamic attributes

For now, the [TodoItem]{.title-ref} component does not visually show if
the [todo]{.title-ref} is completed. Let us do that by using a [dynamic
attributes]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/templates.md#dynamic-attributes).

1.  Add the Bootstrap classes [text-muted]{.title-ref} and
    [text-decoration-line-through]{.title-ref} on the
    [TodoItem]{.title-ref} root element if it is completed.
2.  Change the hardcoded [this.todos]{.title-ref} value to check that it
    is properly displayed.

Even though the directive is named [t-att]{.title-ref} (for attribute),
it can be used to set a [class]{.title-ref} value (and html properties
such as the [value]{.title-ref} of an input).

![image](01_owl_components/muted_todo.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Owl let you combine static class values with dynamic values. The
following example will work as expected:

``` xml
<div class="a" t-att-class="someExpression"/>
```

See also: [Owl: Dynamic class
attributes]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/templates.md#dynamic-class-attribute)
::::

## 9. Adding a todo

So far, the todos in our list are hard-coded. Let us make it more useful
by allowing the user to add a todo to the list.

1.  Remove the hardcoded values in the [TodoList]{.title-ref} component:

    ``` javascript
    this.todos = useState([]);
    ```

2.  Add an input above the task list with placeholder *Enter a new
    task*.

3.  Add an [event handler]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/event_handling.md)
    on the [keyup]{.title-ref} event named [addTodo]{.title-ref}.

4.  Implement [addTodo]{.title-ref} to check if enter was pressed
    (`ev.keyCode === 13`), and in that case, create a new todo with the
    current content of the input as the description and clear the input
    of all content.

5.  Make sure the todo has a unique id. It can be just a counter that
    increments at each todo.

6.  Bonus point: don\'t do anything if the input is empty.

## Theory: Component lifecycle and hooks

So far, we have seen one example of a hook function:
[useState]{.title-ref}. A [hook]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/hooks.md) is a
special function that *hook into* the internals of the component. In the
case of [useState]{.title-ref}, it generates a proxy object linked to
the current component. This is why hook functions have to be called in
the [setup]{.title-ref} method, and no later!

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="01_owl_components/component_lifecycle.svg"
style="width:50.0%" />
</figure>

An Owl component goes through a lot of phases: it can be instantiated,
rendered, mounted, updated, detached, destroyed\... This is the
[component lifecycle]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/component.md#lifecycle).
The figure above show the most important events in the life of a
component (hooks are shown in purple). Roughly speaking, a component is
created, then updated (potentially many times), then is destroyed.

Owl provides a variety of built-in [hooks
functions]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/hooks.md). All of them have to be
called in the [setup]{.title-ref} function. For example, if you want to
execute some code when your component is mounted, you can use the
[onMounted]{.title-ref} hook:

``` javascript
setup() {
  onMounted(() => {
    // do something here
  });
}
```

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

All hook functions start with [use]{.title-ref} or [on]{.title-ref}. For
example: [useState]{.title-ref} or [onMounted]{.title-ref}.
::::

## 10. Focusing the input

Let\'s see how we can access the DOM with
[t-ref]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/refs.md) and
[useRef]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/hooks.md#useref). The main idea is
that you need to mark the target element in the component template with
a \`t-ref\`:

``` xml
<div t-ref="some_name">hello</div>
```

Then you can access it in the JS with the [useRef
hook]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/hooks.md#useref). However, there is a
problem if you think about it: the actual html element for a component
does not exist when the component is created. It only exists when the
component is mounted. But hooks have to be called in the
[setup]{.title-ref} method. So, [useRef]{.title-ref} return an object
that contains a [el]{.title-ref} (for element) key that is only defined
when the component is mounted.

``` js
setup() {
   this.myRef = useRef('some_name');
   onMounted(() => {
      console.log(this.myRef.el);
   });
}
```

1.  Focus the [input]{.title-ref} from the previous exercise. This this
    should be done from the [TodoList]{.title-ref} component (note that
    there is a [focus]{.title-ref} method on the input html element).
2.  Bonus point: extract the code into a specialized
    [hook]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/hooks.md) [useAutofocus]{.title-ref}
    in a new `awesome_owl/utils.js`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file.

![image](01_owl_components/autofocus.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Refs are usually suffixed by [Ref]{.title-ref} to make it obvious that
they are special objects:

``` js
this.inputRef = useRef('input');
```
::::

## 11. Toggling todos

Now, let\'s add a new feature: mark a todo as completed. This is
actually trickier than one might think. The owner of the state is not
the same as the component that displays it. So, the
[TodoItem]{.title-ref} component needs to communicate to its parent that
the todo state needs to be toggled. One classic way to do this is by
adding a [callback
prop]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/props.md#binding-function-props)
[toggleState]{.title-ref}.

1.  Add an input with the attribute `type="checkbox"` before the id of
    the task, which must be checked if the state
    [isCompleted]{.title-ref} is true.

    :::: tip
    ::: title
    Tip
    :::

    Owl does not create attributes computed with the [t-att]{.title-ref}
    directive if it evaluates to a falsy value.
    ::::

2.  Add a callback props [toggleState]{.title-ref} to
    [TodoItem]{.title-ref}.

3.  Add a [change]{.title-ref} event handler on the input in the
    [TodoItem]{.title-ref} component and make sure it calls the
    [toggleState]{.title-ref} function with the todo id.

4.  Make it work!

![image](01_owl_components/toggle_todo.png){.align-center}

## 12. Deleting todos

The final touch is to let the user delete a todo.

1.  Add a new callback prop [removeTodo]{.title-ref} in
    [TodoItem]{.title-ref}.

2.  Insert `<span class="fa fa-remove"/>` in the template of the
    [TodoItem]{.title-ref} component.

3.  Whenever the user clicks on it, it should call the
    [removeTodo]{.title-ref} method.

4.  Make it work!

    :::: tip
    ::: title
    Tip
    :::

    If you\'re using an array to store your todo list, you can use the
    JavaScript [splice]{.title-ref} function to remove a todo from it.
    ::::

``` 
// find the index of the element to delete
const index = list.findIndex((elem) => elem.id === elemId);
if (index >= 0) {
      // remove the element at index from list
      list.splice(index, 1);
}
```

![image](01_owl_components/delete_todo.png){.align-center}

## 13. Generic [Card]{.title-ref} with slots {#tutorials/discover_js_framework/generic_card}

In a
`previous exercise <tutorials/discover_js_framework/simple_card>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, we built a simple [Card]{.title-ref} component. But it is
honestly quite limited. What if we want to display some arbitrary
content inside a card, such as a sub-component? Well, it does not work,
since the content of the card is described by a string. It would however
be very convenient if we could describe the content as a piece of
template.

This is exactly what Owl\'s [slot]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/slots.md)
system is designed for: allowing to write generic components.

Let us modify the [Card]{.title-ref} component to use slots:

1.  Remove the [content]{.title-ref} prop.
2.  Use the default slot to define the body.
3.  Insert a few cards with arbitrary content, such as a
    [Counter]{.title-ref} component.
4.  (bonus) Add prop validation.

[Bootstrap: documentation on
cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/card/)
:::

## 14. Minimizing card content

Finally, let\'s add a feature to the [Card]{.title-ref} component, to
make it more interesting: we want a button to toggle its content (show
it or hide it)

1.  Add a state to the [Card]{.title-ref} component to track if it is
    open (the default) or not
2.  Add a [t-if]{.title-ref} in the template to conditionally render the
    content
3.  Add a button in the header, and modify the code to flip the state
    when the button is clicked

# Chapter 2: Build a dashboard

The first part of this tutorial introduced you to most of Owl ideas. It
is now time to learn about the Odoo JavaScript framework in its
entirety, as used by the web client.

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="02_build_a_dashboard/previously_learned.svg"
style="width:50.0%" />
</figure>

To get started, you need a running Odoo server and a development
environment setup. Before getting into the exercises, make sure you have
followed all the steps described in this
`tutorial introduction <tutorials/discover_js_framework/setup>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. For this chapter, we will start from the empty dashboard
provided by the [awesome_dashboard]{.title-ref} addon. We will
progressively add features to it, using the Odoo JavaScript framework.

Solutions

The solutions for each exercise of the chapter are hosted on the
[official Odoo tutorials
repository](https://github.com/odoo/tutorials/commits/{CURRENT_MAJOR_BRANCH}-discover-js-framework-solutions/awesome_dashboard).
:::

## 1. A new Layout

Most screens in the Odoo web client uses a common layout: a control
panel on top, with some buttons, and a main content zone just below.
This is done using the [Layout
component]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/src/search/layout.js),
available in [\@web/search/layout]{.title-ref}.

1.  Update the [AwesomeDashboard]{.title-ref} component located in
    `awesome_dashboard/static/src/`{.interpreted-text role="file"} to
    use the [Layout]{.title-ref} component. You can use
    `{controlPanel: {} }` for the [display]{.title-ref} props of the
    [Layout]{.title-ref} component.
2.  Add a [className]{.title-ref} prop to \`Layout\`:
    [className=\"\'o_dashboard h-100\'\"]{.title-ref}
3.  Add a [dashboard.scss]{.title-ref} file in which you set the
    background-color of [.o_dashboard]{.title-ref} to gray (or your
    favorite color)

Open <http://localhost:8069/web>, then open the
`Awesome Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app, and see the
result.

## Theory: Services {#tutorials/discover_js_framework/services}

In practice, every component (except the root component) may be
destroyed at any time and replaced (or not) with another component. This
means that each component internal state is not persistent. This is fine
in many cases, but there certainly are situations where we want to keep
some data around. For example, all Discuss messages should not be
reloaded every time we display a channel.

Also, it may happen that we need to write some code that is not a
component. Maybe something that process all barcodes, or that manages
the user configuration (context, etc.).

The Odoo framework defines the idea of a
`service <frontend/services>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, which is a
persistent piece of code that exports state and/or functions. Each
service can depend on other services, and components can import a
service.

The following example registers a simple service that displays a
notification every 5 seconds:

``` js
import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";

const myService = {
    dependencies: ["notification"],
    start(env, { notification }) {
        let counter = 1;
        setInterval(() => {
            notification.add(`Tick Tock ${counter++}`);
        }, 5000);
    },
};

registry.category("services").add("myService", myService);
```

Services can be accessed by any component. Imagine that we have a
service to maintain some shared state:

``` js
import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";

const sharedStateService = {
    start(env) {
        let state = {};
        return {
            getValue(key) {
                return state[key];
            },
            setValue(key, value) {
                state[key] = value;
            },
        };
    },
};

registry.category("services").add("shared_state", sharedStateService);
```

Then, any component can do this:

``` js
import { useService } from "@web/core/utils/hooks";

setup() {
   this.sharedState = useService("shared_state");
   const value = this.sharedState.getValue("somekey");
   // do something with value
}
```

## 2. Add some buttons for quick navigation

One important service provided by Odoo is the [action]{.title-ref}
service: it can execute all kind of standard actions defined by Odoo.
For example, here is how one component could execute an action by its
xml id:

``` js
import { useService } from "@web/core/utils/hooks";
...
setup() {
      this.action = useService("action");
}
openSettings() {
      this.action.doAction("base_setup.action_general_configuration");
}
...
```

Let us now add two buttons to our control panel:

1.  A button [Customers]{.title-ref}, which opens a kanban view with all
    customers (this action already exists, so you should use [its xml
    id](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/1f4e583ba20a01f4c44b0a4ada42c4d3bb074273/odoo/addons/base/views/res_partner_views.xml#L510)).
2.  A button [Leads]{.title-ref}, which opens a dynamic action on the
    [crm.lead]{.title-ref} model with a list and a form view. Follow the
    example of [this use of the action
    service](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/ef424a9dc22a5abbe7b0a6eff61cf113826f04c0/addons/account/static/src/components/journal_dashboard_activity/journal_dashboard_activity.js#L28-L35).

service]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/src/webclient/actions/action_service.js)
:::

## 3. Add a dashboard item

Let us now improve our content.

1.  Create a generic [DashboardItem]{.title-ref} component that display
    its default slot in a nice card layout. It should take an optional
    [size]{.title-ref} number props, that default to [1]{.title-ref}.
    The width should be hardcoded to [(18\*size)rem]{.title-ref}.
2.  Add two cards to the dashboard. One with no size, and the other with
    a size of 2.

![image](02_build_a_dashboard/dashboard_item.png){.align-center}

::: seealso
[Owl\'s slot system]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/slots.md)
:::

## 4. Call the server, add some statistics

Let\'s improve the dashboard by adding a few dashboard items to display
*real* business data. The [awesome_dashboard]{.title-ref} addon provides
a [/awesome_dashboard/statistics]{.title-ref} route that is meant to
return some interesting information.

To call a specific controller, we need to use the
`rpc <frontend/services/rpc>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} function. It
only exports a single function that perform the request:
`rpc(route, params, settings)`. A basic request could look like this:

``` js
import { rpc } from "@web/core/network/rpc";
// ...

setup() {
   onWillStart(async () => {
      const result = await rpc("/my/controller", {a: 1, b: 2});
   })
   // ...
}
```

1.  Update [Dashboard]{.title-ref} so that it uses the [rpc]{.title-ref}
    function and call the statistics route
    [/awesome_dashboard/statistics]{.title-ref}.
2.  Display a few cards in the dashboard containing:
    - Number of new orders this month
    - Total amount of new orders this month
    - Average amount of t-shirt by order this month
    - Number of cancelled orders this month
    - Average time for an order to go from \'new\' to \'sent\' or
      \'cancelled\'

![image](02_build_a_dashboard/statistics.png){.align-center}

::: seealso
[Code: rpc]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/src/core/network/rpc.js)
:::

## 5. Cache network calls, create a service

If you open the `Network`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of your
browser\'s dev tools, you will see that the call to
[/awesome_dashboard/statistics]{.title-ref} is done every time the
client action is displayed. This is because the
[onWillStart]{.title-ref} hook is called each time the
[Dashboard]{.title-ref} component is mounted. But in this case, we would
prefer to do it only the first time, so we actually need to maintain
some state outside of the [Dashboard]{.title-ref} component. This is a
nice use case for a service!

1.  Register and import a new [awesome_dashboard.statistics]{.title-ref}
    service.
2.  It should provide a function [loadStatistics]{.title-ref} that, once
    called, performs the actual rpc, and always return the same
    information.
3.  Use the
    [memoize](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/1f4e583ba20a01f4c44b0a4ada42c4d3bb074273/addons/web/static/src/core/utils/functions.js#L11)
    utility function from [\@web/core/utils/functions]{.title-ref} that
    allows caching the statistics.
4.  Use this service in the [Dashboard]{.title-ref} component.
5.  Check that it works as expected.

## 6. Display a pie chart

Everyone likes charts (!), so let us add a pie chart in our dashboard.
It will display the proportions of t-shirts sold for each size:
S/M/L/XL/XXL.

For this exercise, we will use [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/). It
is the chart library used by the graph view. However, it is not loaded
by default, so we will need to either add it to our assets bundle, or
lazy load it. Lazy loading is usually better since our users will not
have to load the chartjs code every time if they don\'t need it.

1.  Create a [PieChart]{.title-ref} component.
2.  In its [onWillStart]{.title-ref} method, load chartjs, you can use
    the
    [loadJs](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/1f4e583ba20a01f4c44b0a4ada42c4d3bb074273/addons/web/static/src/core/assets.js#L23)
    function to load `/web/static/lib/Chart/Chart.js`{.interpreted-text
    role="file"}.
3.  Use the [PieChart]{.title-ref} component in a
    [DashboardItem]{.title-ref} to display a [pie
    chart](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/2.8.0/charts/doughnut.html) that
    shows the quantity for each sold t-shirts in each size (that
    information is available in the [/statistics]{.title-ref} route).
    Note that you can use the [size]{.title-ref} property to make it
    look larger.
4.  The [PieChart]{.title-ref} component will need to render a canvas,
    and draw on it using [chart.js]{.title-ref}.
5.  Make it work!

## 7. Real life update

Since we moved the data loading in a cache, it never updates. But let us
say that we are looking at fast moving data, so we want to periodically
(for example, every 10min) reload fresh data.

This is quite simple to implement, with a [setTimeout]{.title-ref} or
[setInterval]{.title-ref} in the statistics service. However, here is
the tricky part: if the dashboard is currently being displayed, it
should be updated immediately.

To do that, one can use a [reactive]{.title-ref} object: it is just like
the proxy returned by [useState]{.title-ref}, but not linked to any
component. A component can then do a [useState]{.title-ref} on it to
subscribe to its changes.

1.  Update the statistics service to reload data every 10 minutes (to
    test it, use 10s instead!)
2.  Modify it to return a
    [reactive]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/reactivity.md#reactive) object.
    Reloading data should update the reactive object in place.
3.  The [Dashboard]{.title-ref} component can now use it with a
    [useState]{.title-ref}

reactivity]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/reactivity.md) - [Example: Use of
reactive in a

:::

## 8. Lazy loading the dashboard

Let us imagine that our dashboard is getting quite big, and is only of
interest to some of our users. In that case, it could make sense to lazy
load our dashboard, and all related assets, so we only pay the cost of
loading the code when we actually want to look at it.

One way to do this is to use [LazyComponent]{.title-ref} (from
[\@web/core/assets]{.title-ref}) as an intermediate that will load an
asset bundle before displaying our component.

::: example
`example_action.js`{.interpreted-text role="file"}:

``` javascript
export class ExampleComponentLoader extends Component {
    static components = { LazyComponent };
    static template = xml`
        <LazyComponent bundle="'example_module.example_assets'" Component="'ExampleComponent'" />
    `;
}

registry.category("actions").add("example_module.example_action", ExampleComponentLoader);
```
:::

1.  Move all dashboard assets into a sub folder
    `/dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="file"} to make it easier to add
    to a bundle.
2.  Create a [awesome_dashboard.dashboard]{.title-ref} assets bundle
    containing all content of the `/dashboard`{.interpreted-text
    role="file"} folder.
3.  Modify `dashboard.js`{.interpreted-text role="file"} to register
    itself to the [lazy_components]{.title-ref} registry instead of
    [actions]{.title-ref}.
4.  In `src/dashboard_action.js`{.interpreted-text role="file"}, create
    an intermediate component that uses [LazyComponent]{.title-ref} and
    register it to the [actions]{.title-ref} registry.

## 9. Making our dashboard generic

So far, we have a nice working dashboard. But it is currently hardcoded
in the dashboard template. What if we want to customize our dashboard?
Maybe some users have different needs and want to see other data.

So, the next step is to make our dashboard generic: instead of
hard-coding its content in the template, it can just iterate over a list
of dashboard items. But then, many questions come up: how to represent a
dashboard item, how to register it, what data should it receive, and so
on. There are many different ways to design such a system, with
different trade-offs.

For this tutorial, we will say that a dashboard item is an object with
the following structure:

``` js
const item = {
   id: "average_quantity",
   description: "Average amount of t-shirt",
   Component: StandardItem,
   // size and props are optionals
   size: 3,
   props: (data) => ({
      title: "Average amount of t-shirt by order this month",
      value: data.average_quantity
   }),
};
```

The [description]{.title-ref} value will be useful in a later exercise
to show the name of items that the user can add to their dashboard. The
[size]{.title-ref} number is optional, and simply describes the size of
the dashboard item that will be displayed. Finally, the
[props]{.title-ref} function is optional. If not given, we will simply
give the [statistics]{.title-ref} object as data. But if it is defined,
it will be used to compute specific props for the component.

The goal is to replace the content of the dashboard with the following
snippet:

``` xml
<t t-foreach="items" t-as="item" t-key="item.id">
   <DashboardItem size="item.size || 1">
      <t t-set="itemProp" t-value="item.props ? item.props(statistics) : {'data': statistics}"/>
      <t t-component="item.Component" t-props="itemProp" />
   </DashboardItem>
</t>
```

Note that the above example features two advanced features of Owl:
dynamic components and dynamic props.

We currently have two kinds of item components: number cards with a
title and a number, and pie cards with some label and a pie chart.

1.  Create and implement two components: [NumberCard]{.title-ref} and
    [PieChartCard]{.title-ref}, with the corresponding props.

2.  Create a file `dashboard_items.js`{.interpreted-text role="file"} in
    which you define and export a list of items, using
    [NumberCard]{.title-ref} and [PieChartCard]{.title-ref} to recreate
    our current dashboard.

3.  Import that list of items in our [Dashboard]{.title-ref} component,
    add it to the component, and update the template to use a
    [t-foreach]{.title-ref} like shown above.

    ``` js
    setup() {
       this.items = items;
    }
    ```

And now, our dashboard template is generic!

## 10. Making our dashboard extensible

However, the content of our item list is still hardcoded. Let us fix
that by using a registry:

1.  Instead of exporting a list, register all dashboard items in a
    [awesome_dashboard]{.title-ref} registry
2.  Import all the items of the [awesome_dashboard]{.title-ref} registry
    in the [Dashboard]{.title-ref} component

The dashboard is now easily extensible. Any other Odoo addon that wants
to register a new item to the dashboard can just add it to the registry.

## 11. Add and remove dashboard items

Let us see how we can make our dashboard customizable. To make it
simple, we will save the user dashboard configuration in the local
storage so that it is persistent, but we don\'t have to deal with the
server for now.

The dashboard configuration will be saved as a list of removed item ids.

1.  Add a button in the control panel with a gear icon to indicate that
    it is a settings button.
2.  Clicking on that button should open a dialog.
3.  In that dialog, we want to see a list of all existing dashboard
    items, each with a checkbox.
4.  There should be a [Apply]{.title-ref} button in the footer. Clicking
    on it will build a list of all item ids that are unchecked.
5.  We want to store that value in the local storage.
6.  And modify the [Dashboard]{.title-ref} component to filter the
    current items by removing the ids of items from the configuration.

![image](02_build_a_dashboard/items_configuration.png){.align-center
width="80.0%"}

## 12. Going further

Here is a list of some small improvements you could try to do if you
have the time:

1.  Make sure your application can be
    `translated <reference/translations>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    (with [env.\_t]{.title-ref}).
2.  Clicking on a section of the pie chart should open a list view of
    all orders that have the corresponding size.
3.  Save the content of the dashboard in a user setting on the server!
4.  Make it responsive: in mobile mode, each card should take 100% of
    the width.

# Discover the web framework

::: {.toctree titlesonly="" glob=""}
discover_js_framework/\*
:::

This two parts tutorial is designed to introduce you to the basics of
the web framework. Whether you are new to the framework or have some
prior experience, this tutorial will provide you with a solid foundation
for using the web framework in your projects.

The first part covers the basics of Owl components, which are a key part
of the web framework. Owl components are reusable UI components that can
be used to build complex web interfaces quickly and efficiently. We will
explore how to create and use Owl components in Odoo. Then, in the
second part of this tutorial, we focus on creating a dashboard using
various features of Odoo. Dashboards are an essential part of any web
application, and provide a nice starting point to use and interact with
the Odoo codebase.

This tutorial assumes that you have some basic knowledge of development
with Odoo in general (models, controllers, QWeb, \...). If you are new
to Odoo, we recommend that you start with the
`/developer/tutorials/server_framework_101`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} tutorial before proceeding with this one.

# Write importable modules

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

This tutorial assumes familiarity with the
`server_framework_101`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} tutorial and the
`define_module_data`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} tutorial.
::::

Although, as developers, we prefer to have the full power of Python to
write our modules, it is sometimes not possible to do so; typically on
managed hosting solutions which do not allow the deployment of custom
Python code like the [Odoo.com](https://www.odoo.com/start) platform.

However, the flexible nature of Odoo is meant to allow customizations
out of the box. Whilst a lot is possible with
`Studio </applications/studio>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, it is
also possible to define models, fields and logic in
`XML Data Files <define_module_data>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
This makes it easier to develop, maintain and deploy these
customizations.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to define models, fields and logic
in XML data files and bundle them into a module. These are sometimes
called *importable modules*, or *data modules*. We will also see the
limitations of this approach to module development.

## Problem statement

Like in the `server_framework_101`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
tutorial, we will be working on Real Estate concepts.

Our goal is to create a new application to manage Real Estate properties
in a similar (albeit simpler) way to the
`server_framework_101`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} tutorial. We will
define the models, fields and logic in XML data files instead of Python
files.

At the end of this tutorial, we will be able to achieve the following in
our app:

- Manage Real Estate properties that are for sale
- Publish these properties on a website
- Accept offers online from the website
- Invoice the buyer when the property is sold

## Module structure

Like in any development project, a clear structure makes it easier to
manage and maintain the code.

Unlike standard Odoo modules that use both Python and XML files, data
modules use only XML files. Therefore, it is expected that your work
tree will look something like this:

``` bash
estate
├── actions
│   └── *.xml
├── models
│   └── *.xml
├── security
│   └── ir.model.access.csv
│   └── estate_security.xml
├── views
│   └── *.xml
├── __init__.py
└── __manifest__.py
```

The only Python files you will have are the
`__init__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"} and
`__manifest__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"} files. The
`__manifest__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file will be the same
as for any Odoo module, but will also import its models in the
[data]{.title-ref} list.

Remember to list files in the [data]{.title-ref} section of
`__manifest__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"} in order of dependency,
typically starting with model files.

The `__init__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file is empty, but is
required for Odoo to recognize the module if you ever want to deploy
your module in the classic way (by adding it in an addons path). It is
not strictly necessary for modules that will be *imported*, but it is a
good practice to keep it.

## Deploying the module

To deploy the module, you will need to create a zip file of the module
and upload it to your Odoo instance. Make sure that the module
[base_import_module]{.title-ref} is installed on your instance, then go
to the `Apps --> Import Module`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
and upload the zip file. You must be in
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to see
the [Import Module]{.title-ref} menu item.

If you modify the module, you will need to create a new zip file and
upload it again, which will reload all the data in the module. Note
however that some operations are not possible, like changing the type of
a field you created previously. Data created by previous versions of the
module (like removed fields) will not be automatically deleted. In
general, the simplest way to handle this is to start with a fresh
database or to uninstall the module prior to uploading the new version.

When uploading a module, the wizard will accept two options:

- \`Force init\`: if your module is already installed and you upload it
  again; checking this option will force the update of all data marked
  as [noupdate=\"1\"]{.title-ref} in the XML files.
- \`Import demo data\`: self explanatory

It is also possible to deploy the module using the
`odoo-bin <../reference/cli>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} command line
tool with the [deploy]{.title-ref} command:

``` bash
$ odoo-bin deploy <path_to_your_module> https://<your_odoo_instance> --login <your_login> --password <your_password>
```

This command also accepts the [\--force]{.title-ref} option, which is
equivalent to the `Force init`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option
in the wizard.

Note that the user you use to deploy the module must have
[Administration/Settings]{.title-ref} access rights.

::: exercise
1.  Create the following folders and files:

    - `/home/$USER/src/tutorials/estate/__init__.py`{.interpreted-text
      role="file"}
    - `/home/$USER/src/tutorials/estate/__manifest__.py`{.interpreted-text
      role="file"}

    The `__manifest__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file should
    only define the name and the dependencies of our modules. The only
    necessary framework module for now is `base` (and
    `base_import_module` -although your module does not *depend* on it
    strictly speaking, you need it to be able to import your module).

2.  Create a zip file of your module and upload it to your Odoo
    instance.
:::

## Models and basic fields

As you can imagine, defining models and fields in XML files is not as
straightforward as in Python.

Since data files are read sequentially, you must define the elements in
the right order. For example, you must define a model before you can
define a field on that model, and you must define fields before adding
them to a view.

In addition, XML is simply much more verbose than Python.

Let\'s start by defining a simple model to represent a Real Estate
property in the [models]{.title-ref} directory of our module.

Odoo models are stored in database as [ir.model]{.title-ref} records.
Like any other record, they can be defined in XML files:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo>
    <record id="model_real_estate_property" model="ir.model">
        <field name="name">Real Estate Property</field>
        <field name="model">x_estate.property</field>
    </record>
</odoo>
```

Note that all models and fields defined in data files must be prefixed
with [x\_]{.title-ref}; this is mandatory and is used to differentiate
them from models and fields defined in Python files.

Like for classic models defined in Python, Odoo will automatically add
several fields to the model:

- `~odoo.fields.Model.id`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}
  (`~odoo.fields.Id`{.interpreted-text role="class"}) The unique
  identifier for a record of the model.
- `~odoo.fields.Model.create_date`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}
  (`~odoo.fields.Datetime`{.interpreted-text role="class"}) Creation
  date of the record.
- `~odoo.fields.Model.create_uid`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}
  (`~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"}) User who
  created the record.
- `~odoo.fields.Model.write_date`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}
  (`~odoo.fields.Datetime`{.interpreted-text role="class"}) Last
  modification date of the record.
- `~odoo.fields.Model.write_uid`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}
  (`~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"}) User who
  last modified the record.

We can also add several fields to our new model. Let\'s add some simple
fields, like a name (string), selling price (float), a description (as
html), and a postcode (as a char).

Like for models, fields are simply records of the
[ir.model.fields]{.title-ref} model and can be defined as such in data
files:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo>
    <!-- ...model definition from before... -->
    <record id="field_real_estate_property_name" model="ir.model.fields">
        <field name="model_id" ref="estate.model_real_estate_property" />
        <field name="name">x_name</field>
        <field name="field_description">Name</field>
        <field name="ttype">char</field>
        <field name="required">True</field>
    </record>

    <record id="field_real_estate_property_selling_price" model="ir.model.fields">
        <field name="model_id" ref="estate.model_real_estate_property" />
        <field name="name">x_selling_price</field>
        <field name="field_description">Selling Price</field>
        <field name="ttype">float</field>
        <field name="required">True</field>
    </record>

    <record id="field_real_estate_property_description" model="ir.model.fields">
        <field name="model_id" ref="estate.model_real_estate_property" />
        <field name="name">x_description</field>
        <field name="field_description">Description</field>
        <field name="ttype">html</field>
    </record>

    <record id="field_real_estate_property_postcode" model="ir.model.fields">
        <field name="model_id" ref="estate.model_real_estate_property" />
        <field name="name">x_postcode</field>
        <field name="field_description">Postcode</field>
        <field name="ttype">char</field>
    </record>
</odoo>
```

You can set various attributes for your new field. For basic fields,
these include:

- \`name\`: the technical name of the field (must begin with
  [x\_]{.title-ref})
- \`field_description\`: the label of the field
- \`help\`: a help text for the field, displayed in the interface
- \`ttype\`: the type of the field (e.g. [char]{.title-ref},
  [integer]{.title-ref}, [float]{.title-ref}, [html]{.title-ref}, etc.)
- \`required\`: whether the field is required or not (default:
  [False]{.title-ref})
- \`readonly\`: whether the field is read-only or not (default:
  [False]{.title-ref})
- \`index\`: whether the field is indexed or not (default:
  [False]{.title-ref})
- \`copied\`: whether the field is copied when duplicating a record or
  not (default: [True]{.title-ref} for non-relational non-computed
  fields, [False]{.title-ref} for relational and computed fields)
- \`translate\`: whether the field is translatable or not (default:
  [False]{.title-ref})

Attributes are also available to control HTML sanitization as well as
other, more advanced features; for a complete list, refer to the
[ir.model.fields]{.title-ref} model in the database available in the
`Settings --> Technical --> Database Structure --> Fields`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} menu or see the [ir.model.fields]{.title-ref}
model definition in the [base]{.title-ref} module.

::: exercise
Add the following basic fields to the table:

  Field                  Type        Required
  ---------------------- ----------- ----------
  x_date_availability    Date        
  x_expected_price       Float       True
  x_bedrooms             Integer     
  x_living_area          Integer     
  x_facades              Integer     
  x_garage               Boolean     
  x_garden               Boolean     
  x_garden_area          Integer     
  x_garden_orientation   Selection   

The `x_garden_orientation` field must have 4 possible values: \'North\',
\'South\', \'East\' and \'West\'. The selection list must be created by
first creating the [ir.model.fields]{.title-ref} record for the field
itself, then creating the [ir.model.fields.selection]{.title-ref}
records. These records take three fields: [field_id]{.title-ref},
[name]{.title-ref} (the name in the UI) and [value]{.title-ref} (the
value in the database). A [sequence]{.title-ref} field can also be set,
which controls the order in which the selections are displayed in the UI
(lower sequence values are displayed first).
:::

### Default values

In Python, default values can be set on fields using the `default`
argument in the field declaration. In data modules, default values are
set by creating an `ir.default` record for each field. For example, it
is possible to set the default value of the `x_selling_price` field to
`100000` for all properties by creating the following record:

``` xml
<odoo>
    <!-- ...model definition from before... -->
    <record id="default_real_estate_property_selling_price" model="ir.default">
        <field name="field_id" ref="estate.field_real_estate_property_selling_price" />
        <field name="json_value">100000</field>
    </record>
</odoo>
```

For more details, refer to the [ir.default]{.title-ref} model in the
database available in the
`Settings --> Technical --> Actions --> User-defined Defaults`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} menu or see the [ir.default]{.title-ref} model
definition in the [base]{.title-ref} module.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

These defaults are static but can be set by company and/or user using
the `user_id` and `company_id` fields of the `ir.default` record. This
means that having a dynamic default value of \"today\" for the
`x_date_availability` field is not possible, for example.

## Security

Security in data modules is exactly the same as for Python modules and
can be found in
`server_framework_101/04_securityintro`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

Refer to that tutorial for details.

Views are the UI components that allow users to interact with the data.
They are defined in XML files and can be found in the
`views`{.interpreted-text role="file"} directory of your module.

Since views and actions are already defined in
`server_framework_101/05_firstui`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
`server_framework_101/06_basicviews`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, we
will not go into details here.

::: exercise
Add a basic UI to the [estate]{.title-ref} module.

Add a basic UI to the [estate]{.title-ref} module to allow users to
view, create, edit and delete Real Estate properties.

- Create an action for the model `x_estate.property`.
- Create a tree view for the model `x_estate.property`.
- Create a form view for the model `x_estate.property`.
- Add the views to the action.
- Add a menu item to the main menu to allow users to access the action.
:::

## Relations

The real power of relational systems like Odoo lies in the ability to
link records together. In a normal Python module, one could define new
fields on a model to link it to other models in a single line of code.
In a data module, this is still possible but requires a bit more legwork
since we can\'t use the same syntax as in Python.

As in `server_framework_101/07_relations`{.interpreted-text role="doc"},
we will add some relations to our [estate]{.title-ref} module. We will
add links to:

- the customer who bought the property
- the real estate agent who sold the property
- the property type: house, apartment, penthouse, castle\...
- a list of tags characterizing the property: cozy, renovated\...
- a list of the offers received

### Many-to-one

A many-to-one is a simple link to another object. For example, in order
to define a link to the `res.partner`, we can define a new field in our
model:

``` xml
<odoo>
    <!-- ...model definition from before... -->
    <record id="field_real_estate_property_partner_id" model="ir.model.fields">
        <field name="model_id" ref="estate.model_real_estate_property" />
        <field name="name">x_partner_id</field>
        <field name="field_description">Customer</field>
        <field name="ttype">many2one</field>
        <field name="relation">res.partner</field>
    </record>
</odoo>
```

In the case of many-to-one fields, several attributes can be set to
detail the relation:

- \`relation\`: the name of the model to link to (required)
- \`ondelete\`: the action to perform when the record is deleted
  (default: [set null]{.title-ref})
- \`domain\`: a domain filter to apply to the relation

::: exercise
1.  Create a new model `x_estate.property.type` with the following
    fields:

      Field                Type   Required
      -------------------- ------ ----------
      [name]{.title-ref}   Char   True

2.  Add an action, list view and menu item for the
    `x_estate.property.type` model.

3.  Add Access Rights to the `x_estate.property.type` model to give
    access to users.

4.  Create the following fields on the `x_estate.property` model:

      Field                                   Type                                  Required
      --------------------------------------- ------------------------------------- ----------
      [x_property_type_id]{.title-ref}        Many2one (`x_estate.property.type`)   True
      [x_partner_id]{.title-ref} (buyer)      Many2one (`res.partner`)              
      [x_user_id]{.title-ref} (salesperson)   Many2one (`res.users`)                

5.  Include the new fields in the form view of the `x_estate.property`
    model.
:::

### Many-to-many

A many-to-many is a relation to a list of objects. In our example, we
will define a many-to-many relation towards a new
`x_estate.property.tag` model. This tag represents a characteristic of
the property, for example: renovated, cozy, etc.

A property can have many tags and a tag can be assigned to many
properties - this is the typical many-to-many relationship.

Many-to-many fields are defined in the same way as many-to-one fields,
but with the [ttype]{.title-ref} set to [many2many]{.title-ref}. The
[relation]{.title-ref} attribute is also set to the name of the model to
link to. Other attributes can be set to control the relation:

- \`relation_table\`: the name of the table to use for the relation
- [column1]{.title-ref} and \`column2\`: the names of the columns to use
  for the relation

These attributes are optional, and should usually be specified only when
there are multiple many-to-many fields between two models to avoid
conflict; in most cases, the Odoo ORM will be able to determine the
correct relation table and columns to use.

::: exercise
1.  Create a new model `x_estate.property.tag` with the following
    fields:

      Field                Type   Required
      -------------------- ------ ----------
      [name]{.title-ref}   Char   True

2.  Add an action, list view and menu item for the
    `x_estate.property.tag` model.

3.  Add Access Rights to the `x_estate.property.tag` model to allow
    access to users.

4.  Create the following fields on the `x_estate.property` model:

      Field                              Type
      ---------------------------------- -------------------------------------
      [x_property_tag_ids]{.title-ref}   Many2many (`x_estate.property.tag`)

5.  Include the new field in the form view of the `x_estate.property`
    model.
:::

### One-to-many

A one-to-many is a relation to a list of objects. In our example, we
will define a one-to-many relation towards a new
`x_estate.property.offer` model. This offer represent an offer made by a
customer to buy a property.

One-to-many fields are defined in the same way as many-to-one fields,
but with the [ttype]{.title-ref} set to [one2many]{.title-ref}. The
[relation]{.title-ref} attribute is also set to the name of the model to
link to. Another attribute must be set to control the relation:

- \`relation_field\`: the name of the field on the related model that
  contains the reference to the parent model (many-to-one field). This
  is used to link the two models together.

::: exercise
1.  Create a new model `x_estate.property.offer` with the following
    fields:

      Field                         Type                             Required   Values
      ----------------------------- -------------------------------- ---------- -------------------
      [x_price]{.title-ref}         Float                            True       
      [x_status]{.title-ref}        Selection                                   Accepted, Refused
      [x_partner_id]{.title-ref}    Many2one (`res.partner`)         True       
      [x_property_id]{.title-ref}   Many2one (`x_estate.property`)   True       

2.  Add Access Rights to the `x_estate.property.offer` model to allow
    access to users.

3.  | Create a tree view and a form view with the price, partner_id and
      status fields.
    | No need to create an action or a menu.

4.  Add the field `x_offer_ids` to your `x_estate.property` model and in
    its form view.

## Computed and related fields

### Computed fields

Computed fields are a core concept in Odoo and are used to define fields
that are computed based on other fields. This is useful for fields that
are derived from other fields, like a sum of sub-records (adding up the
price of all the items in a sale order).

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`reference/fields/compute`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Data modules can define computed fields of any type, but are quite
limited compared to Python modules. Indeed, since data modules are meant
to be deployed on systems that do not allow arbitrary code to run, the
Python code that is allowed is very limited.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

All Python code written for data modules is executed in a sandboxed
environment that limits the operations that can be performed. For
example, you cannot import libraries, you cannot access any OS files,
and you cannot even print to the console. Some utilities are provided,
but this varies with the type of sandboxed environment that is used.

In the case of compute methods, the sandbox is very limited and only
provides the bare minimum of utilities to allow the execution of the
code. In addition to the Python builtins, you also have access to the
[datetime]{.title-ref}, [dateutil]{.title-ref} and [time]{.title-ref}
modules (e.g., to help with date calculations).

Note also that \"dot assignation\" is disabled in the sandbox, so you
cannot write `property.x_total_area = 1` in the compute method. You have
to use dictionary access: `property['x_total_area'] = 1`. Dot notation
for field *access* works normally: `property.x_garden_area` will return
the value of the `x_garden_area` field.
::::

We previously defined two \"area\" fields on our `x_estate.property`
model: `living_area` and `garden_area`. To define a computed field on
the model that returns the sum of the two areas, we can add the
following code to our data module:

``` xml
<odoo>
    <!-- ...model definition from before... -->
    <record id="field_real_estate_property_total_area" model="ir.model.fields">
        <field name="model_id" ref="estate.model_real_estate_property" />
        <field name="name">x_total_area</field>
        <field name="field_description">Total Area</field>
        <field name="ttype">float</field>
        <field name="depends">x_living_area,x_garden_area</field>
        <field name="compute"><![CDATA[
for property in self:
    property['x_total_area'] = property.x_living_area + property.x_garden_area
        ]]>
        </field>
    </record>
</odoo>
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Whilst in server actions, you iterate on a [records]{.title-ref}
variable, in the case of a computed field, you iterate on a
[self]{.title-ref} variable that contains the recordset on which the
field is computed.
::::

The `depends` attribute is used to define the fields that the computed
field depends on and the `compute` attribute is used to define the code
that is executed to compute the field (using Python code).

Unlike in Python modules, computed fields are stored by default. If you
wish for a computed field to not be stored (e.g., for performance
reasons or to avoid database bloat), you can set the `store` attribute
to `False`. The same applies to `readonly`: if you want your computed
field to not be editable, you need to set the `readonly` attribute to
`True`.

The [CDATA]{.title-ref} section is used to specify to XML parsers that
the content is a string and not XML; this prevents the parser from
trying to interpret the Python code as XML, or the addition of extra
space, etc. when the code gets inserted into the database at module
install time.

::: exercise
1.  Add a computed field to the `x_estate.property` model that returns
    the sum of the `x_living_area` and `x_garden_area` fields, as shown
    above.
2.  Include the field in the form view of the `x_estate.property` model.
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Unlike in Python modules, it is not possible to define an inverse or
search method for computed fields.
::::

### Related fields

Related fields are a simplified form of computed fields that mirror the
value of another field through a many2one relationship.

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`reference/fields/related`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Related fields can be of any type (the type of the field at the other
end of the relation traversal). They are defined as if one were adding
the field directly to the model with the addition of a `related`
attribute that specifies the target field on the related model that
contains the value to be mirrored.

For example, if we want to access the country of the buyer directly from
the `x_estate.property` model, we can add the following code to our data
module:

``` xml
<odoo>
    <!-- ...model definition from before... -->
    <record id="field_real_estate_property_country_id" model="ir.model.fields">
        <field name="model_id" ref="estate.model_real_estate_property" />
        <field name="name">x_country_id</field>
        <field name="field_description">Buyer's Country</field>
        <field name="ttype">many2one</field>
        <field name="relation">res.country</field>
        <field name="related">x_partner_id.country_id</field>
    </record>
</odoo>
```

The `related` attribute is used to specify the target field on the
related model that contains the value to be mirrored. This must be a
dot-separated list of field names.

## Code and business logic

### Server actions

In a Python module, you are free to define any method on your model. One
common usage pattern is to add so-called \"actions\" methods to your
model then bind these methods to buttons in the UI (e.g to confirm a
quote, post an invoice, etc.).

In a data module, you can achieve the same effect by defining
`Server Actions <reference/actions/server>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} bound to your model. Server actions represent pieces of
logic that are run dynamically on the server. These actions can be
configured manually in the database directly via the
`Settings --> Technical --> Actions --> Server Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} menu and can be of different types; in our case,
we will use the `code` type which allows us to run any Python code in a
sandboxed environment.

This environment contains several utilities to help you interact with
the Odoo database:

- `env`: the environment of the record
- `model`: the model of the record
- `user` and `uid`: the current user and their id
- `datetime`, `dateutil`, `timezone` and `time`: libraries to help with
  date/time calculations
- `float_compare`: a utility function to compare two float values with a
  given precision
- `b64encode` and `b64decode`: utility functions to encode and decode
  values in base64
- `Command`: a utility class to help build complex expressions and
  commands (see the [Command]{.title-ref} class in the
  `ORM reference <reference/fields/relational>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"})

In addition, you have access to the recordset on which the action is
executed (typically a single record when the action is executed from a
form view, and multiple records when the action is executed from a list
view) via the `record` and `records` variables.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If your action needs to return an action to the client (for example to
redirect the user to another view), you can assign it to a an `action`
variable inside your server action\'s code. The code sandbox will
inspect the variables defined in your code after its execution and will
automatically return it if it detects the presence of an `action`
variable.

If the [website]{.title-ref} module is installed, the
[request]{.title-ref} object will be available in the code sandbox and
you can assign a [response]{.title-ref} object to the
[response]{.title-ref} variable to return a response to the client in a
similar way. This is explored in more details in the
`tutorials/importable_modules/website_controllers`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} section.
::::

For example, we could define an action on the `x_estate.property` model
that sets the `x_status` field of all its offers to `Refused`:

``` xml
<record id="action_x_estate_property_refuse_all_offers" model="ir.actions.server">
    <field name="name">Refuse all offers</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="estate.model_real_estate_property"/>
    <field name="state">code</field>
    <field name="code"><![CDATA[
for property in records:
    property.x_offer_ids.write({'x_status': 'refused'})
    ]]></field>
</record>
```

To include this action as a button in the form view of the
`x_estate.property` model, we can add the following
`button <reference/view_architectures/form/button>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} node in the header of our form view:

``` xml
<!-- form view definition from your code... -->
<header>
    <button name="estate.action_x_estate_property_refuse_all_offers" type="action" string="Refuse all offers"/>
</header>
```

It is also possible to add an entry in the gear icon
(`fa-gear`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}) to run this action (e.g. to
avoid adding buttons to views that are already crowded). To do so, you
can *bind* your server action to the model and to specific types of
views:

``` xml
<record id="action_x_estate_property_refuse_all_offers" model="ir.actions.server">
    <field name="name">Refuse all offers</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="estate.model_real_estate_property"/>
    <field name="state">code</field>
    <field name="binding_model_id" ref="estate.model_real_estate_property"/>
    <field name="binding_view_types">tree,form</field>
    <field name="code"><![CDATA[
for property in records:
    property.x_offer_ids.write({'x_status': 'refused'})
    ]]></field>
</record>
```

This will make the action available in the gear icon
(`fa-gear`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}) of the `x_estate.property`
model, in the list (when one or more records are selected via the
checkbox) and form views.

::: exercise
1.  Add a server action to the `x_estate.property.offer` model that sets
    the `x_status` field of an offer to `Accepted` and updates the
    selling price and buyer of the property to which the offer is
    attached accordingly. This action should also mark all the other
    offers on the same property as `Refused`.
2.  Include a button in the embedded list view of offers that allows to
    execute this action

### Overriding Python models

#### Via UI elements

Unlike in Python modules, it is not possible to override a Python
model\'s method cleanly.

However, it is possible (in some cases) to replace the elements of the
UI that call these methods and to intercept the calls to these methods
in a server action.

A typical example would be an integration with the `Sales` app of Odoo.
Let\'s imagine that your Real Estate module integrates with the Sales
application so that when a specific product is sold (e.g., a quote for
managing the sale of a property), you want to automatically create a new
property record in your module.

To achieve this, you will need to:

- create a server action that calls the original method of the button
  and add custom logic before or after that method call
- replace the button in the view with a custom button that calls the
  server action

``` xml
<record id="view_sale_order_form" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">sale.order.form.inherit.estate</field>
    <field name="model">sale.order</field>
    <field name="inherit_id" ref="sale.view_order_form" />
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <xpath expr="//button[@name='action_confirm'][@type='object']" position="attributes">
            <attribute name="type">action</attribute>
            <attribute name="name">estate.action_x_estate_property_create_from_sale_order</attribute>
        </xpath>
        <!-- since the button is present twice in the original view, we need to replace it twice -->
        <xpath expr="//button[@name='action_confirm'][@type='object']" position="attributes">
            <attribute name="type">action</attribute>
            <attribute name="name">estate.action_x_estate_property_create_from_sale_order</attribute>
        </xpath>
    </field>
</record>

<record id="action_x_estate_property_create_from_sale_order" model="ir.actions.server">
    <field name="name">Confirm and create property from sale order</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="sale.model_sale_order"/>
    <field name="state">code</field>
    <field name="code"><![CDATA[
for order in records:
    order.action_confirm()
    property_type = env['x_estate.property.type'].sudo().search([('x_name', '=', 'Other')], limit=1)
    property = env['x_estate.property'].sudo().create({
        'x_name': order.name,
        'x_expected_price': 0,
        'x_selling_price': 0,
        'x_sale_order_id': order.id,
        'x_property_type_id': property_type.id,
    })
    ]]></field>
</record>
```

#### Via automation rules

Automations rules are a way to automatically execute actions on records
in the database based on specific triggers, like state changes, addition
of a tag, etc. They can be useful to tie behaviour to life-cycle events
of records, for example by sending an email when an offer is accepted.

Using automation rules for extending a standard behaviour can be more
robust than the UI-based approach since it will also run if the
life-cycle event is triggered in another way than via a button (e.g.,
via a webhook or a direct call to the method; for example when a quote
is confirmed via the portal or the e-commerce). They are however a bit
more finicky to set up properly, as one needs to ensure that the
automation will only run at the proper moment by setting up specific
fields to watch, etc.

**Documentation**: a more complete documentation related to this topic
can be found in
`/applications/studio/automated_actions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Automation Rules are not part of the `base` module; they come with the
`base_automation` module; so if you define automation rules in your data
module, you need to make sure that `base_automation` is part of your
module\'s dependencies.

Once installed, Automation Rules are managed via the
`Settings --> Technical --> Automations --> Automation Rules`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} menu.
::::

Automation Rules are particularly useful to tie a data module to an
existing standard Odoo module. Since data modules cannot override
methods, tying automation to life-cycle changes of standard models is a
common way to extend standard modules.

If we were to rewrite our example from the previous section using
automation rules, a few changes would be needed:

- the server action should no longer call the original method of the
  button (instead, the original method will trigger the change that will
  fire the automation rule)
- the view extension is not needed
- we need to define an Automation Rule to trigger the server action on
  the appropriate event

``` xml
<record id="action_x_estate_property_create_from_sale_order" model="ir.actions.server">
    <field name="name">Create property from sale order</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="sale.model_sale_order"/>
    <field name="state">code</field>
    <field name="code"><![CDATA[
for order in records:
    property_type = env['x_estate.property.type'].sudo().search([('x_name', '=', 'Other')], limit=1)
    property = env['x_estate.property'].sudo().create({
        'x_name': order.name,
        'x_expected_price': 0,
        'x_selling_price': 0,
        'x_sale_order_id': order.id,
        'x_property_type_id': property_type.id,
    })
    ]]></field>
</record>

<record id="automation_rule_x_estate_property_create_from_sale_order" model="base.automation">
    <field name="name">Create property from sale order</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="sale.model_sale_order"/>
    <field name="trigger">on_state_set</field>
    <field name="trg_selection_field_id" ref="sale.selection__sale_order__state__sale"/>
    <field name="trigger_field_ids" eval="[(4, ref('sale.field_sale_order__state'))]"/>
    <field name="action_server_ids" eval="[(4, ref('estate.action_x_estate_property_create_from_sale_order'))]"/>
</record>
```

Note that the
`XML IDs <tutorials/define_module_data/xml_id>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to standard Odoo models, fields, selection values, etc. can
be found in the Odoo instance itself by navigating to the appropriate
record in the technical menus and using the `View Metadata` menu entry
of the debug menu. XML IDs for models are simply the model name with
dots replaced by underscores and prefixed by `model_` (e.g.,
`sale.model_sale_order` is `sale.order` as defined in the
[sale]{.title-ref} module); XML IDs for fields are the model name with
dots replaced by underscores and prefixed by `field_`, the model\'s name
and the field name (e.g., `sale.field_sale_order__name` is the XML ID
for the `name` field of the `sale.order` model which is defined in the
[sale]{.title-ref} module).

### Website controllers {#tutorials/importable_modules/website_controllers}

HTTP Controllers in Odoo are usually defined in the
`controllers`{.interpreted-text role="file"} directory of a module. In
data modules, it is possible to define server actions that behave as
controllers if the website module is installed.

When the website module is installed, server actions can be marked as
[Available on the website]{.title-ref} and given a path (the full path
is always prefixed with [/website/action]{.title-ref} to avoid URL
collisions); the global [request]{.title-ref} object is made available
in the local scope of the code server action.

The [request]{.title-ref} object provides several methods to access the
body of the request:

- \`request.get_http_params()\`: extract key-value pairs from the query
  string and the forms present in the body (both
  [application/x-www-form-urlencoded]{.title-ref} and
  [multipart/form-data]{.title-ref}).
- \`request.get_json_data()\`: extract the JSON data from the body of
  the request.

Since it is not possible to return a value from within a server action,
to define the response to return, one can assign a response-like object
to the [response]{.title-ref} variable, which will be returned to the
website automatically.

Here is an example of a simple website controller that will return a
list of properties when the URL [/website/action/estate]{.title-ref} is
called:

``` xml
<record id="server_action_estate_list" model="ir.actions.server">
    <field name="name">Estate List Controller</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="estate.model_real_estate_property" />
    <field name="website_published">True</field>
    <field name="website_path">estate</field>
    <field name="state">code</field>
    <field name="code"><![CDATA[

    html += f'<li>{property.x_name}</li>'
html += '</ul></body></html>'
response = request.make_response(html)
    ]]></field>
</record>
```

Several useful methods are available in the [request]{.title-ref} object
to facilitate the generation of the response object:

- [request.render(template, qcontext=None, lazy=True,
  \*\*kw)]{.title-ref} to render a QWeb template using its xmlid; the
  extra keyword arguments are forwarded to the
  [werkzeug.Response]{.title-ref} object (e.g. to set cookies, headers,
  etc.)
- [request.redirect(location, code=303, local=True)]{.title-ref} to
  redirect to a different URL; the [local]{.title-ref} argument is used
  to specify whether the redirection should be relative to the website
  or not (default: [True]{.title-ref}).
- [request.notfound()]{.title-ref} to return a
  [werkzeug.HTTPException]{.title-ref} exception to signal a 404 error
  to the website.
- [request.make_response(data, headers=None, cookies=None,
  status=200)]{.title-ref} to manually create a
  [werkzeug.Response]{.title-ref} object; the [status]{.title-ref}
  argument is the HTTP status code to return (default: 200).
- [request.make_json_response(data, headers=None, cookies=None,
  status=200)]{.title-ref} to manually create a JSON response; the data
  will be json-serialized using [json.dumps]{.title-ref} utility; this
  can be useful to set up server-to-server communications via API calls.

For implementation details or other (less common) methods, refer to the
[Request]{.title-ref} object\'s implementation in the
[odoo.http]{.title-ref} module.

Note that security concerns are left to the developer (typically through
security rules or by using [sudo]{.title-ref} to access records).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The model used in the [model_id]{.title-ref} field of the server action
must be accessible to the public user for the write operation for this
server action to run; otherwise the server action will return a 403
error. A way to avoid giving access is to link your server action to a
model that is already accessible to the public user, a typical (if
weird) example is to link the server action to the
[ir.filters]{.title-ref} model.

Add a JSON API to your module so that external services can retrieve a
list of properties for sale.

1.  add a new [x_api_published]{.title-ref} field to the model to
    control whether the properties are published on the API or not
2.  add an access right record to allow public users to read and write
    the model
3.  prevent any write from the public user by adding a record rule for
    the write operation with an impossible domain (e.g. [\[(\'id\',
    \'=\', False)\]]{.title-ref})
4.  add a record rule so that properties marked as
    [x_api_published]{.title-ref} can be read by the public user
5.  add a server action to return a list of properties in JSON format
    when the URL [/website/action/estate]{.title-ref} is called
:::

## A sprinkle of JavaScript

Whilst importable modules cannot include Python files, no such
restriction exists for JavaScript files. Adding JavaScript files to your
importable module is exactly the same as adding them to a standard Odoo
module.

This means that an importable module can include new field components or
even entirely new views.

As an example, let\'s add a simple \'tour\' to the Estate module. Tours
are a standard mechanism in Odoo used to onboard users by guiding them
through your application.

A very minimal tour with a single step can be added by adding this file
in \`static/src/js/tour.js\`:

``` js
import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";


registry.category("web_tour.tours").add('estate_tour', {
    url: "/web",
    steps: () => [{
    trigger: '.o_app[data-menu-xmlid="estate.menu_root"]',
    content: 'Start selling your properties from this app!',
    }],
});
```

You then need to include the file in the appropriate bundle in the
manifest file:

``` py
{
    "name": "Real Estate",
    # [...]
    "assets": {
        "web.assets_backend": [
            "estate/static/src/js/tour.js",
        ],
    },
}
```

You also need to add an xml record in a new estate_tour.xml file in the
data folder so that your tour is displayed:

``` xml
<record id="estate_tour" model="web_tour.tour">
    <field name="name">estate_tour</field>
    <field name="sequence">2</field>
    <field name="rainbow_man_message">Welcome! Happy exploring.</field>
</record>
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Unlike normal Python modules, glob expansion is not supported in
importable modules; so you need to list each file you want to include in
the module specifically.

# Chapter 1: Build a Clicker game

For this project, we will build together a [clicker
game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game), completely
integrated with Odoo. In this game, the goal is to accumulate a large
number of clicks, and to automate the system. The interesting part is
that we will use the Odoo user interface as our playground. For example,
we will hide bonuses in some random parts of the web client.

To get started, you need a running Odoo server and a development
environment. Before getting into the exercises, make sure you have
followed all the steps described in this
`tutorial introduction <tutorials/master_odoo_web_framework/setup>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Solutions

The solutions for each exercise of the chapter are hosted on the
[official Odoo tutorials
repository](https://github.com/odoo/tutorials/commits/{CURRENT_MAJOR_BRANCH}-master-odoo-web-framework-solutions/awesome_clicker).
:::

## 1. Create a systray item

To get started, we want to display a counter in the systray.

1.  Create a [clicker_systray_item.js]{.title-ref} (and
    [xml]{.title-ref}) file with a hello world Owl component.
2.  Register it to the systray registry, and make sure it is visible.
3.  Update the content of the item so that it displays the following
    string: [Clicks: 0]{.title-ref}, and add a button on the right to
    increment the value.

![image](01_build_clicker_game/systray.png){.align-center}

And voila, we have a completely working clicker game!

:::

## 2. Count external clicks

Well, to be honest, it is not much fun yet. So let us add a new feature:
we want all clicks in the user interface to count, so the user is
incentivized to use Odoo as much as possible! But obviously, the
intentional clicks on the main counter should still count more.

1.  Use [useExternalListener]{.title-ref} to listen on all clicks on
    [document.body]{.title-ref}.
2.  Each of these clicks should increase the counter value by 1.
3.  Modify the code so that each click on the counter increased the
    value by 10
4.  Make sure that a click on the counter does not increase the value by
    11!
5.  Also additional challenge: make sure the external listener capture
    the events, so we don\'t miss any clicks.

  capture](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#event_capture)
:::

## 3. Create a client action

Currently, the current user interface is quite small: it is just a
systray item. We certainly need more room to display more of our game.
To do that, let us create a client action. A client action is a main
action, managed by the web client, that displays a component.

1.  Create a [client_action.js]{.title-ref} (and [xml]{.title-ref})
    file, with a hello world component.

2.  Register that client action in the action registry under the name
    [awesome_clicker.client_action]{.title-ref}

3.  Add a button on the systray item with the text [Open]{.title-ref}.
    Clicking on it should open the client action
    [awesome_clicker.client_action]{.title-ref} (use the action service
    to do that).

4.  To avoid disrupting employees\' workflow, we prefer the client
    action to open within a popover rather than in fullscreen mode.
    Modify the [doAction]{.title-ref} call to open it in a popover.

    :::: tip
    ::: title
    Tip
    :::

    You can use [target: \"new\"]{.title-ref} in the
    [doAction]{.title-ref} to open the action in a popover:

    ``` js
    {
       type: "ir.actions.client",
       tag: "awesome_clicker.client_action",
       target: "new",
       name: "Clicker"
    }
    ```
    ::::

![image](01_build_clicker_game/client_action.png){.align-center}

::: seealso
- `How to create a client action <howtos/javascript_client_action>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
:::

## 4. Move the state to a service

For now, our client action is just a hello world component. We want it
to display our game state, but that state is currently only available in
the systray item. So it means that we need to change the location of our
state to make it available for all our components. This is a perfect use
case for services.

1.  Create a [clicker_service.js]{.title-ref} file with the
    corresponding service.

2.  This service should export a reactive value (the number of clicks)
    and a few functions to update it:

    ``` js
    const state = reactive({ clicks: 0 });
    ...
    return {
       state,
       increment(inc) {
          state.clicks += inc
       }
    };
    ```

3.  Access the state in both the systray item and the client action
    (don\'t forget to [useState]{.title-ref} it). Modify the systray
    item to remove its own local state and use it. Also, you can remove
    the [+10 clicks]{.title-ref} button.

4.  Display the state in the client action, and add a [+10]{.title-ref}
    clicks button in it.

![image](01_build_clicker_game/increment_button.png){.align-center}

- `Short explanation on services <tutorials/discover_js_framework/services>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
:::

## 5. Use a custom hook

Right now, every part of the code that will need to use our clicker
service will have to import [useService]{.title-ref} and
[useState]{.title-ref}. Since it is quite common, let us use a custom
hook. It is also useful to put more emphasis on the
[clicker]{.title-ref} part, and less emphasis on the
[service]{.title-ref} part.

1.  Export a [useClicker]{.title-ref} hook.

2.  Update all current uses of the clicker service to the new hook:

    ``` js
    this.clicker = useClicker();
    ```

::: seealso
- [Documentation on
  hooks:](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/reference/hooks.md)
:::

## 6. Humanize the displayed value

We will in the future display large numbers, so let us get ready for
that. There is a [humanNumber]{.title-ref} function that format numbers
in a easier to comprehend way: for example, [1234]{.title-ref} could be
formatted as [1.2k]{.title-ref}

1.  Use it to display our counters (both in the systray item and the
    client action).

2.  Create a [ClickValue]{.title-ref} component that display the value.

    :::: note
    ::: title

:::

## 7. Add a tooltip in [ClickValue]{.title-ref} component

With the [humanNumber]{.title-ref} function, we actually lost some
precision on our interface. Let us display the real number as a tooltip.

1.  Tooltip needs an html element. Change the [ClickValue]{.title-ref}
    to wrap the value in a [\<span/\>]{.title-ref} element
2.  Add a dynamic [data-tooltip]{.title-ref} attribute to display the
    exact value.

:::

## 8. Buy ClickBots

Let us make our game even more interesting: once a player get to 1000
clicks for the first time, the game should unlock a new feature: the
player can buy robots for 1000 clicks. These robots will generate 10
clicks every 10 seconds.

1.  Add a [level]{.title-ref} number to our state. This is a number that
    will be incremented at some milestones, and open new features
2.  Add a [clickBots]{.title-ref} number to our state. It represents the
    number of robots that have been purchased.
3.  Modify the client action to display the number of click bots (only
    if [level \>= 1]{.title-ref}), with a [Buy]{.title-ref} button that
    is enabled if [clicks \>= 1000]{.title-ref}. The [Buy]{.title-ref}
    button should increment the number of clickbots by 1.
4.  Set a 10s interval in the service that will increment the number of
    clicks by [10\*clickBots]{.title-ref}.
5.  Make sure the Buy button is disabled if the player does not have
    enough clicks.

![image](01_build_clicker_game/clickbot.png){.align-center}

## 9. Refactor to a class model

The current code is written in a somewhat functional style. But to do
so, we have to export the state and all its update functions in our
clicker object. As this project grows, this may become more and more
complex. To make it simpler, let us split our business logic out of our
service and into a class.

1.  Create a [clicker_model]{.title-ref} file that exports a reactive
    class. Move all the state and update functions from the service into
    the model.

    :::: tip
    ::: title
    Tip
    :::

    You can extends the ClickerModel with the [Reactive]{.title-ref}
    class from `@web/core/utils/reactive`{.interpreted-text
    role="file"}. The [Reactive]{.title-ref} class wrap the model into a
    reactive proxy.
    ::::

2.  Rewrite the clicker service to instantiate and export the clicker
    model class.

::: seealso

  Reactive](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/c638913df191dfcc5547f90b8b899e7738c386f1/addons/web/static/src/model/relational_model/datapoint.js#L32)
:::

## 10. Notify when a milestone is reached

There is not much feedback that something changed when we reached 1k
clicks. Let us use the [effect]{.title-ref} service to communicate that
information clearly. The problem is that our click model does not have
access to services. Also, we want to keep as much as possible the UI
concern out of the model. So, we can explore a new strategy for
communication: event buses.

1.  Update the clicker model to instantiate a bus, and to trigger a
    [MILESTONE_1k]{.title-ref} event when we reach 1000 clicks for the
    first time.
2.  Change the clicker service to listen to the same event on the model
    bus.
3.  When that happens, use the [effect]{.title-ref} service to display a
    rainbow man.
4.  Add some text to explain that the user can now buy clickbots.

  bus](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/reference/utils.md#eventbus)

:::

## 11. Add BigBots

Clearly, we need a way to provide the player with more choices. Let us
add a new type of clickbot: [BigBots]{.title-ref}, which are just more
powerful: they provide with 100 clicks each 10s, but they cost 5000
clicks

1.  increment [level]{.title-ref} when it gets to 5k (so it should be 2)
2.  Update the state to keep track of bigbots
3.  bigbots should be available at [level \>=2]{.title-ref}
4.  Display the corresponding information in the client action

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If you need to use [\<]{.title-ref} or [\>]{.title-ref} in a template as
a javascript expression, be careful since it might class with the xml
parser. To solve that, you can use one of the special aliases: [gt, gte,
lt]{.title-ref} or [lte]{.title-ref}. See the [Owl documentation page on
template
expressions](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/reference/templates.md#expression-evaluation).
::::

![image](01_build_clicker_game/bigbot.png){.align-center}

## 12. Add a new type of resource: power

Now, to add another scaling point, let us add a new type of resource: a
power multiplier. This is a number that can be increased at [level \>=
3]{.title-ref}, and multiplies the action of the bots (so, instead of
providing one click, clickbots now provide us with
[multiplier]{.title-ref} clicks).

1.  increment [level]{.title-ref} when it gets to 100k (so it should be
    3).
2.  update the state to keep track of the power (initial value is 1).
3.  change bots to use that number as a multiplier.
4.  Update the user interface to display and let the user purchase a new
    power level (costs: 50k).

![image](01_build_clicker_game/bigbot.png){.align-center}

## 13. Define some random rewards

We want the user to obtain sometimes bonuses, to reward using Odoo.

1.  Define a list of rewards in [click_rewards.js]{.title-ref}. A reward
    is an object with:

    - a [description]{.title-ref} string.
    - a [apply]{.title-ref} function that take the game state in
      argument and can modify it.
    - a [minLevel]{.title-ref} number (optional) that describes at which
      unlock level the bonus is available.
    - a [maxLevel]{.title-ref} number (optional) that describes at which
      unlock level a bonus is no longer available.

    For example:

    ``` js
    export const rewards = [
       {
          description: "Get 1 click bot",
          apply(clicker) {
                clicker.increment(1);
          },
          maxLevel: 3,
       },
       {
          description: "Get 10 click bot",
          apply(clicker) {
                clicker.increment(10);
          },
          minLevel: 3,
          maxLevel: 4,
       },
       {
          description: "Increase bot power!",
          apply(clicker) {
                clicker.multipler += 1;
          },
          minLevel: 3,
       },
    ];
    ```

    You can add whatever you want to that list!

2.  Define a function [getReward]{.title-ref} that will select a random
    reward from the list of rewards that matches the current unlock
    level.

3.  Extract the code that choose randomly in an array in a function
    [choose]{.title-ref} that you can move to another
    [utils.js]{.title-ref} file.

## 14. Provide a reward when opening a form view

1.  Patch the form controller. Each time a form controller is created,
    it should randomly decides (1% chance) if a reward should be given.
2.  If the answer is yes, call a method [getReward]{.title-ref} on the
    model.
3.  That method should choose a reward, send a sticky notification, with
    a button [Collect]{.title-ref} that will then apply the reward, and
    finally, it should open the [clicker]{.title-ref} client action.

## 15. Add commands in command palette

1.  Add a command [Open Clicker Game]{.title-ref} to the command
    palette.
2.  Add another command: [Buy 1 click bot]{.title-ref}.

:::

## 16. Add yet another resource: trees

It is now time to introduce a completely new type of resources. Here is
one that should not be too controversial: trees. We will now allow the
user to plant (collect?) fruit trees. A tree costs 1 million clicks, but
it will provide us with fruits (either pears or cherries).

1.  Update the state to keep track of various types of trees:
    pear/cherries, and their fruits.
2.  Add a function that computes the total number of trees and fruits.
3.  Define a new unlock level at [clicks \>= 1 000 000]{.title-ref}.
4.  Update the client user interface to display the number of trees and
    fruits, and also, to buy trees.
5.  Increment the fruit number by 1 for each tree every 30s.

![image](01_build_clicker_game/trees.png){.align-center}

## 17. Use a dropdown menu for the systray item

Our game starts to become interesting. But for now, the systray only
displays the total number of clicks. We want to see more information:
the total number of trees and fruits. Also, it would be useful to have a
quick access to some commands and some more information. Let us use a
dropdown menu!

1.  Replace the systray item by a dropdown menu.
2.  It should display the numbers of clicks, trees, and fruits, each
    with a nice icon.
3.  Clicking on it should open a dropdown menu that displays more
    detailed information: each types of trees and fruits.
4.  Also, a few dropdown items with some commands: open the clicker
    game, buy a clickbot, \...

![image](01_build_clicker_game/dropdown.png){.align-center}

## 18. Use a Notebook component

We now keep track of a lot more information. Let us improve our client
interface by organizing the information and features in various tabs,
with the [Notebook]{.title-ref} component:

1.  Use the [Notebook]{.title-ref} component.
2.  All [click]{.title-ref} content should be displayed in one tab.
3.  All [tree/fruits]{.title-ref} content should be displayed in another
    tab.

:::

## 19. Persist the game state

You certainly noticed a big flaw in our game: it is transient. The game
state is lost each time the user closes the browser tab. Let us fix
that. We will use the local storage to persist the state.

1.  Import [browser]{.title-ref} from
    `@web/core/browser/browser`{.interpreted-text role="file"} to access
    the localstorage.
2.  Serialize the state every 10s (in the same interval code) and store
    it on the local storage.
3.  When the [clicker]{.title-ref} service is started, it should load
    the state from the local storage (if any), or initialize itself
    otherwise.

## 20. Introduce state migration system

Once you persist state somewhere, a new problem arises: what happens
when you update your code, so the shape of the state changes, and the
user opens its browser with a state that was created with an old
version? Welcome to the world of migration issues!

It is probably wise to tackle the problem early. What we will do here is
add a version number to the state, and introduce a system to
automatically update the states if it is not up to date.

1.  Add a version number to the state.
2.  Define an (empty) list of migrations. A migration is an object with
    a [fromVersion]{.title-ref} number, a [toVersion]{.title-ref}
    number, and a [apply]{.title-ref} function.
3.  Whenever the code loads the state from the local storage, it should
    check the version number. If the state is not uptodate, it should
    apply all necessary migrations.

## 21. Add another type of trees

To test our migration system, let us add a new type of trees: peaches.

1.  Add [peach]{.title-ref} trees.
2.  Increment the state version number.
3.  Define a migration.

# Chapter 2: Create a Gallery View

Let us see how one can create a new view, completely from scratch. In a
way, it is not very difficult to do, but there are no really good
resources on how to do it. Note that most situations should be solved by
either customizing an existing view, or with a client action.

For this exercise, let\'s assume that we want to create a
[gallery]{.title-ref} view, which is a view that lets us represent a set
of records with an image field.

The problem could certainly be solved with a kanban view, but this means
that it is not possible to have our normal kanban view and the gallery
view in the same action.

Let us make a gallery view. Each gallery view will be defined by an
[image_field]{.title-ref} attribute in its arch:

``` xml
<gallery image_field="some_field"/>
```

To complete the tasks in this chapter, you will need to install the
awesome_gallery addon. This addon includes the necessary server files to
add a new view.

Solutions

The solutions for each exercise of the chapter are hosted on the
[official Odoo tutorials
repository](https://github.com/odoo/tutorials/commits/{CURRENT_MAJOR_BRANCH}-master-odoo-web-framework-solutions/awesome_gallery).
:::

## 1. Make a hello world view

First step is to create a JavaScript implementation with a simple
component.

1.  Create the [gallery_view.js]{.title-ref} ,
    [gallery_controller.js]{.title-ref} and
    [gallery_controller.xml]{.title-ref} files in
    [static/src]{.title-ref}.

2.  Implement a simple hello world component in
    [gallery_controller.js]{.title-ref}.

3.  In [gallery_view.js]{.title-ref}, import the controller, create a
    view object, and register it in the view registry under the name
    [gallery]{.title-ref}.

    ::: example
    Here is an example on how to define a view object:

    ``` js
    import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";
    import { MyController } from "./my_controller";

    export const myView = {
          type: "my_view",
          display_name: "MyView",
          icon: "oi oi-view-list",
          multiRecord: true,
          Controller: MyController,
    };

    registry.category("views").add("my_controller", myView);
    ```
    :::

4.  Add [gallery]{.title-ref} as one of the view type in the
    [contacts.action_contacts]{.title-ref} action.

5.  Make sure that you can see your hello world component when switching
    to the gallery view.

![image](02_create_gallery_view/view_button.png){.align-center}

![image](02_create_gallery_view/new_view.png){.align-center}

## 2. Use the Layout component

So far, our gallery view does not look like a standard view. Let\'s use
the [Layout]{.title-ref} component to have the standard features like
other views.

1.  Import the [Layout]{.title-ref} component and add it to the
    [components]{.title-ref} of [GalleryController]{.title-ref}.
2.  Update the template to use [Layout]{.title-ref}. It needs a
    [display]{.title-ref} prop, which can be found in
    [props.display]{.title-ref}.

![image](02_create_gallery_view/layout.png){.align-center}

## 3. Parse the arch

For now, our gallery view does not do much. Let\'s start by reading the
information contained in the arch of the view.

The process of parsing an arch is usually done with a
[ArchParser]{.title-ref}, specific to each view. It inherits from a
generic [XMLParser]{.title-ref} class.

::: example
Here is an example of what an ArchParser might look like:

``` js
export class MyCustomArchParser {
    parse(xmlDoc) {
       const myAttribute = xmlDoc.getAttribute("my_attribute")
       return {
           myAttribute,
       }
    }
}
```
:::

1.  Create the [ArchParser]{.title-ref} class in its own file.
2.  Use it to read the [image_field]{.title-ref} information.
3.  Update the [gallery]{.title-ref} view code to add it to the props
    received by the controller.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It is probably a little overkill to do it like that, since we basically
only need to read one attribute from the arch, but it is a design that
is used by every other odoo views, since it lets us extract some upfront
processing out of the controller.
::::

::: seealso
[Example: The graph arch
parser]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/src/views/graph/graph_arch_parser.js)
:::

## 4. Load some data

Let us now get some real data from the server. For that we must use
[webSearchRead]{.title-ref} from the orm service.

::: example
Here is an example of a [webSearchRead]{.title-ref} to get the records
from a model:

``` js
const { length, records } = this.orm.webSearchRead(this.resModel, domain, {
   specification: {
        [this.fieldToFetch]: {},
        [this.secondFieldToFetch]: {},
    },
    context: {
        bin_size: true,
    }
})
```
:::

1.  Add a `loadImages(domain) {...}` method to the
    [GalleryController]{.title-ref}. It should perform a
    [webSearchRead]{.title-ref} call from the orm service to fetch
    records corresponding to the domain, and use
    [imageField]{.title-ref} received in props.
2.  If you didn\'t include [bin_size]{.title-ref} in the context of the
    call, you will receive the image field encoded in base64. Make sure
    to put [bin_size]{.title-ref} in the context to receive the size of
    the image field. We will display the image later.
3.  Modify the [setup]{.title-ref} code to call that method in the
    [onWillStart]{.title-ref} and [onWillUpdateProps]{.title-ref} hooks.
4.  Modify the template to display the id and the size of each image
    inside the default slot of the [Layout]{.title-ref} component.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The loading data code will be moved into a proper model in a next
exercise.
::::

![image](02_create_gallery_view/gallery_data.png){.align-center}

## 5. Solve the concurrency problem

For now, our code is not concurrency proof. If one changes the domain
twice, it will trigger the [loadImages(domain)]{.title-ref} twice. We
have thus two requests that can arrive at different time depending on
different factors. Receiving the response for the first request after
receiving the response for the second request will lead to an
inconsistent state.

The [KeepLast]{.title-ref} primitive from Odoo solves this problem, it
manages a list of tasks, and only keeps the last task active.

1.  Import [KeepLast]{.title-ref} from
    `@web/core/utils/concurrency`{.interpreted-text role="file"}.
2.  Instanciate a [KeepLast]{.title-ref} object in the model.
3.  Add the [webSearchRead]{.title-ref} call in the
    [KeepLast]{.title-ref} so that only the last call is resolved.

::: seealso
[Example: usage of
KeepLast](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/ebf646b44f747567ff8788c884f7f18dffd453e0/addons/web/static/src/core/model_field_selector/model_field_selector_popover.js#L164)
:::

## 6. Reorganize code

Real views are a little bit more organized. This may be overkill in this
example, but it is intended to learn how to structure code in Odoo.
Also, this will scale better with changing requirements.

1.  Move all the model code in its own [GalleryModel]{.title-ref} class.
2.  Move all the rendering code in a [GalleryRenderer]{.title-ref}
    component.
3.  Import [GalleryModel]{.title-ref} and [GalleryRenderer]{.title-ref}
    in [GalleryController]{.title-ref} to make it work.

## 7. Make the view extensible

To extends the view, one could import the gallery view object to modify
it to their taste. The problem is that for the moment, it is not
possible to define a custom model or renderer because it is hardcoded in
the controller.

1.  Import [GalleryModel]{.title-ref} and [GalleryRenderer]{.title-ref}
    in the gallery view file.
2.  Add a [Model]{.title-ref} and [Renderer]{.title-ref} key to the
    gallery view object and assign them to [GalleryModel]{.title-ref}
    and [GalleryRenderer]{.title-ref}. Pass [Model]{.title-ref} and
    [Renderer]{.title-ref} as props to the controller.
3.  Remove the hardcoded import in the controller and get them from the
    props.
4.  Use
    [t-component](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/reference/component.md#dynamic-sub-components)
    to have dynamic sub component.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This is how someone could now extend the gallery view by modifying the
renderer:

``` js
import { registry } from '@web/core/registry';
import { galleryView } from '@awesome_gallery/gallery_view';
import { GalleryRenderer } from '@awesome_gallery/gallery_renderer';

export class MyExtendedGalleryRenderer extends GalleryRenderer {
   static template = "my_module.MyExtendedGalleryRenderer";
   setup() {
      super.setup();
      console.log("my gallery renderer extension");
   }
}

registry.category("views").add("my_gallery", {
   ...galleryView,
   Renderer: MyExtendedGalleryRenderer,
});
```
::::

## 8. Display images

Update the renderer to display images in a nice way, if the field is
set. If [image_field]{.title-ref} is empty, display an empty box
instead.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

There is a controller that allows to retrieve an image from a record.
You can use this snippet to construct the link:

``` js
import { url } from "@web/core/utils/urls";
const url = url("/web/image", {
   model: resModel,
   id: image_id,
   field: imageField,
});
```
::::

![image](02_create_gallery_view/tshirt_images.png){.align-center}

## 9. Switch to form view on click

Update the renderer to react to a click on an image and switch to a form
view. You can use the [switchView]{.title-ref} function from the action
service.

::: seealso
[Code: The switchView
function](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/db2092d8d389fdd285f54e9b34a5a99cc9523d27/addons/web/static/src/webclient/actions/action_service.js#L1064)
:::

## 10. Add an optional tooltip

It is useful to have some additional information on mouse hover.

1.  Update the code to allow an optional additional attribute on the
    arch:

    ``` xml
    <gallery image_field="some_field" tooltip_field="some_other_field"/>
    ```

2.  On mouse hover, display the content of the tooltip field. It should
    work if the field is a char field, a number field or a many2one
    field. To put a tooltip to an html element, you can put the string
    in the [data-tooltip]{.title-ref} attribute of the element.

3.  Update the customer gallery view arch to add the customer as tooltip
    field.

:::

## 11. Add pagination

Let\'s add a pager on the control panel and manage all the pagination
like in a normal Odoo view.

:::

## 12. Validating views

We have a nice and useful view so far. But in real life, we may have
issue with users incorrectly encoding the [arch]{.title-ref} of their
Gallery view: it is currently only an unstructured piece of XML.

Let us add some validation! In Odoo, XML documents can be described with
an RN file `(Relax NG file)`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}, and then
validated.

1.  Add an RNG file that describes the current grammar:
    - A mandatory attribute [image_field]{.title-ref}.
    - An optional attribute: [tooltip_field]{.title-ref}.
2.  Add some code to make sure all views are validated against this RNG
    file.
3.  While we are at it, let us make sure that [image_field]{.title-ref}
    and [tooltip_field]{.title-ref} are fields from the current model.

Since validating an RNG file is not trivial, here is a snippet to help:

``` python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import logging
import os

from lxml import etree

from odoo.loglevels import ustr
from odoo.tools import misc, view_validation

_logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

_viewname_validator = None

@view_validation.validate('viewname')
def schema_viewname(arch, **kwargs):
      """ Check the gallery view against its schema

      :type arch: etree._Element
      """
      global _viewname_validator

      if _viewname_validator is None:
         with misc.file_open(os.path.join('modulename', 'rng', 'viewname.rng')) as f:
            _viewname_validator = etree.RelaxNG(etree.parse(f))

      if _viewname_validator.validate(arch):
         return True

      for error in _viewname_validator.error_log:
         _logger.error(ustr(error))
      return False
```

view](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/70942e4cfb7a8993904b4d142e3b1749a40db806/odoo/addons/base/rng/graph_view.rng)
:::

## 13. Uploading an image

Our gallery view does not allow users to upload images. Let us implement
that.

1.  Add a button on each image by using the [FileUploader]{.title-ref}
    component.
2.  The [FileUploader]{.title-ref} component accepts the
    [onUploaded]{.title-ref} props, which is called when the user
    uploads an image. Make sure to call [webSave]{.title-ref} from the
    orm service to upload the new image.
3.  You maybe noticed that the image is uploaded but it is not
    re-rendered by the browser. This is because the image link did not
    change so the browser do not re-fetch them. Include the
    [write_date]{.title-ref} from the record to the image url.
4.  Make sure that clicking on the upload button does not trigger the
    switchView.

:::

## 14. Advanced tooltip template

For now we can only specify a tooltip field. But what if we want to
allow to write a specific template for it ?

::: example
This is an example of a gallery arch view that should work after this
exercise.

``` xml
<record id="contacts_gallery_view" model="ir.ui.view">
   <field name="name">awesome_gallery.orders.gallery</field>
   <field name="model">res.partner</field>
   <field name="arch" type="xml">
      <gallery image_field="image_1920" tooltip_field="name">
         <field name="email"/> <!-- Specify to the model that email should be fetched -->
         <field name="name"/>  <!-- Specify to the model that name should be fetched -->
         <tooltip-template> <!-- Specify the owl template for the tooltip -->
            <p class="m-0">name: <field name="name"/></p> <!-- field is compiled into a t-esc-->
            <p class="m-0">e-mail: <field name="email"/></p>
         </tooltip-template>
      </gallery>
   </field>
</record>
```
:::

1.  Replace the [res.partner]{.title-ref} gallery arch view in
    `awesome_gallery/views/views.xml`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
    with the arch in example above. Don\'t worry if it does not pass the
    rng validation.

2.  Modify the gallery rng validator to accept the new arch structure.

    :::: tip
    ::: title
    Tip
    :::

    You can use this rng snippet to validate the tooltip-template tag

    ``` xml
    <rng:define name="tooltip-template">
       <rng:element name="tooltip-template">
             <rng:zeroOrMore>
                <rng:text/>
                <rng:ref name="any"/>
             </rng:zeroOrMore>
       </rng:element>
    </rng:define>

    <rng:define name="any">
       <rng:element>
             <rng:anyName/>
             <rng:zeroOrMore>
                <rng:choice>
                   <rng:attribute>
                         <rng:anyName/>
                   </rng:attribute>
                   <rng:text/>
                   <rng:ref name="any"/>
                </rng:choice>
             </rng:zeroOrMore>
       </rng:element>
    </rng:define>
    ```
    ::::

3.  The arch parser should parse the fields and the tooltip template.
    Import [visitXML]{.title-ref} from
    `@web/core/utils/xml`{.interpreted-text role="file"} and use it to
    parse field names and the tooltip template.

4.  Make sure that the model call the [webSearchRead]{.title-ref} by
    including the parsed field names in the specification.

5.  The renderer (or any sub-component you created for it) should
    receive the parsed tooltip template. Manipulate this template to
    replace the [\<field\>]{.title-ref} element into a [\<t
    t-esc=\"x\"\>]{.title-ref} element.

    :::: tip
    ::: title
    Tip
    :::

    The template is an [Element]{.title-ref} object so it can be
    manipulated like a HTML element.
    ::::

6.  Register the template to Owl thanks to the [xml]{.title-ref}
    function from `@odoo/owl`{.interpreted-text role="file"}.

7.  Use the [useTooltip]{.title-ref} hook from
    `@web/core/tooltip/tooltip_hook`{.interpreted-text role="file"} to
    display the tooltips. This hooks take as argument the Owl template
    and the variable needed by the template.

# Chapter 3: Customize a kanban view

We have gained an understanding of the numerous capabilities offered by
the web framework. As a next step, we will customize a kanban view. This
is a more complicated project that will showcase some non trivial
aspects of the framework. The goal is to practice composing views,
coordinating various aspects of the UI, and doing it in a maintainable
way.

Bafien had the greatest idea ever: a mix of a kanban view and a list
view would be perfect for your needs! In a nutshell, he wants a list of
customers on the left of the CRM kanban view. When you click on a
customer on the left sidebar, the kanban view on the right is filtered
to only display leads linked to that customer.

[official Odoo tutorials

:::

## 1. Create a new kanban view

Since we are customizing the kanban view, let us start by extending it
and using our extension in the kanban view of CRM.

1.  Create a new empty component that extends the
    [KanbanController]{.title-ref} component from
    `@web/views/kanban/kanban_controller`{.interpreted-text
    role="file"}.
2.  Create a new view object and assign all keys and values from
    [kanbanView]{.title-ref} from
    `@web/views/kanban/kanban_view`{.interpreted-text role="file"}.
    Override the Controller key by putting your newly created
    controller.
3.  Register it in the views registry under
    [awesome_kanban]{.title-ref}.
4.  Update the crm kanban arch in
    `awesome_kanban/views/views.xml`{.interpreted-text role="file"} to
    use the extended view. This can be done by specifying the
    [js_class]{.title-ref} attribute in the kanban node.

:::

## 2. Create a CustomerList component

We will need to display a list of customers, so we might as well create
the component.

1.  Create a [CustomerList]{.title-ref} component which only displays a
    [div]{.title-ref} with some text for now.

2.  It should have a [selectCustomer]{.title-ref} prop.

3.  Create a new template extending (XPath) the kanban controller
    template [web.KanbanView]{.title-ref} to add the
    [CustomerList]{.title-ref} next to the kanban renderer. Give it an
    empty function as [selectCustomer]{.title-ref} for now.

    :::: tip
    ::: title
    Tip
    :::

    You can use this xpath inside the template to add a div before the
    renderer component.

    ``` xml
    <xpath expr="//t[@t-component='props.Renderer']" position="before">
       ...
    </xpath>
    ```
    ::::

4.  Subclass the kanban controller to add [CustomerList]{.title-ref} in
    its sub-components.

5.  Make sure you see your component in the kanban view.

1.  Modify the [CustomerList]{.title-ref} component to fetch a list of
    all customers in [onWillStart]{.title-ref}.
2.  Display the list in the template with a [t-foreach]{.title-ref}.
3.  Whenever a customer is selected, call the
    [selectCustomer]{.title-ref} function prop.

## 4. Update the main kanban view

1.  Implement [selectCustomer]{.title-ref} in the kanban controller to
    add the proper domain.

    :::: tip
    ::: title
    Tip
    :::

    Since it is not trivial to interact with the search view, here is a
    snippet to create a filter:

    ``` js
    this.env.searchModel.createNewFilters([{
          description: partner_name,
          domain: [["partner_id", "=", partner_id]],
          isFromAwesomeKanban: true, // this is a custom key to retrieve our filters later
    }])
    ```
    ::::

2.  By clicking on multiple customers, you can see that the old customer
    filter is not replaced. Make sure that by clicking on a customer,
    the old filter is replaced by the new one.

    :::: tip
    ::: title
    Tip
    :::

    You can use this snippet to get the customers filters and toggle
    them.

    ``` js
    const customerFilters = this.env.searchModel.getSearchItems((searchItem) =>
          searchItem.isFromAwesomeKanban
    );

    for (const customerFilter of customerFilters) {
       if (customerFilter.isActive) {
             this.env.searchModel.toggleSearchItem(customerFilter.id);
       }
    }
    ```
    ::::

3.  Modify the template to give the real function to the
    [CustomerList]{.title-ref} [selectCustomer]{.title-ref} prop.

:::: note

Note
:::

You can use
[Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol)
to make sure that the custom [isFromAwesomeKanban]{.title-ref} key will
not collide with keys any other code might add to the object.
::::

## 5. Only display customers which have an active order

There is a [opportunity_ids]{.title-ref} field on
[res.partner]{.title-ref}. Let us allow the user to filter results on
customers with at least one opportunity.

1.  Add an input of type checkbox in the [CustomerList]{.title-ref}
    component, with a label \"Active customers\" next to it.
2.  Changing the value of the checkbox should filter the list of
    customers.

![image](03_customize_kanban_view/active_customer.png){.align-center}

## 6. Add a search bar to the customer list

Add an input above the customer list that allows the user to enter a
string and to filter the displayed customers, according to their name.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can use the [fuzzyLookup]{.title-ref} from
`@web/core/utils/search`{.interpreted-text role="file"} function to
perform the filter.

:::

## 7. Refactor the code to use [t-model]{.title-ref}

To solve the previous two exercises, it is likely that you used an event
listener on the inputs. Let us see how we could do it in a more
declarative way, with the
[t-model]({OWL_PATH}/doc/reference/input_bindings.md) directive.

1.  Make sure you have a reactive object that represents the fact that
    the filter is active (something like
    `this.state = useState({ displayActiveCustomers: false, searchString: ''})`).
2.  Modify the code to add a getter [displayedCustomers]{.title-ref}
    which returns the currently active list of customers.
3.  Modify the template to use [t-model]{.title-ref}.

## 8. Paginate customers!

1.  Add a `pager <frontend/pager>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} in the
    [CustomerList]{.title-ref}, and only load/render the first 20
    customers.
2.  Whenever the pager is changed, the customer list should update
    accordingly.

This is actually pretty hard, in particular in combination with the
filtering done in the previous exercise. There are many edge cases to
take into account.

# Master the web framework

::: {.toctree titlesonly="" glob=""}
master_odoo_web_framework/\*
:::

This tutorial is designed for those who have completed the
`discover_js_framework`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} tutorial and are
looking to deepen their knowledge of the web framework. It is organized
in four independent projects, each focusing on different features of
Odoo.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Each of these chapters can be done independantly, in any order. Also, be
aware that some of them cover a lot of material, so they may be quite
long.
::::

The first project is about building a [clicker
game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game). While working on
it, you will learn various aspects of the web framework: systray,
command palette, dialogs, notifications, customizing existing components
and much more.

The second project is focused on an important category of components:
fields. Field components represent the value of a field for a record,
they appear in many places in the web client: in form views, obviously,
but also in kanban and list views, and may even be used alone, without a
view. Due to their importance, it makes sense to learn how to create and
manipulate such components.

In the context of the web framework, views usually refers to the
javascript implementation of a component that represents one or many
records, depending on a description ([ir.ui.view]{.title-ref}). Such
components are actually quite complicated and usually requires various
sub systems (a renderer, a model, a controller, a arch parser, \...). In
chapter 3, we create a new view from scratch to represent a list of
images.

Finally, the last project in chapter 4 is about customizing an existing
view (a kanban view) by adding a search panel on its left. It is
interesting to see how one can take existing code, and modify it to suit
our needs. Also, it is a realistic project, that will feature many
common issues that arises while working on Odoo.

## Setup {#tutorials/master_odoo_web_framework/setup}

1.  Clone the [official Odoo tutorials
    repository](https://github.com/odoo/tutorials) and switch to the
    branch [{CURRENT_MAJOR_BRANCH}]{.title-ref}.
2.  Add the cloned repository to your
    `--addons-path <odoo-bin --addons-path>`{.interpreted-text
    role="option"}.
3.  Start a new Odoo database and install the modules for each chapter
    that you want to work on: [awesome_clicker]{.title-ref} (for chapter
    1), [awesome_fields]{.title-ref} (for chapter 2),
    [awesome_gallery]{.title-ref} (for chapter 3) or
    [awesome_kanban]{.title-ref} (for chapter 4).

# Reuse code with mixins

If you need to interface with common Odoo features such as the chatter,
you can rely on `mixins <../reference/backend/mixins>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. They are Odoo models exposing useful methods through
inheritance.

To learn and play with mixins, visit [this
repository](https://github.com/tivisse/odoodays-2018/). This module for
a plant nursery is training material developed for the OXP 2018. You
don\'t need to code it on your side. But you can check the presentations
in the `/static/pdf`{.interpreted-text role="file"} directory and play
with the module to discover some magic features in Odoo.

# Build PDF Reports

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

This tutorial is an extension of the
`server_framework_101`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} tutorial. Make sure
you have completed it and use the [estate]{.title-ref} module you have
built as a base for the exercises in this tutorial.
::::

We were previously
`introduced to QWeb <server_framework_101/14_qwebintro>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} where it was used to build a kanban view. Now we will expand
on one of QWeb\'s other main uses: creating PDF reports. A common
business requirement is the ability to create documents to send to
customers and to use internally. These reports can be used to summarize
and display information in an organized template to support the business
in different ways. Odoo can additionally add our company\'s header and
footer to our reports with minimal extra effort.

The documentation related to this topic can be found in
`reference/qweb`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`reference/reports/report`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and the
`reference/actions/report`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} section of the
Actions reference.

## File Structure

The bulk of a PDF report is its QWeb template. It also typically needs a
corresponding `ir.actions.report` to include the report within a
module\'s business logic. There is no strict rule for the file names or
where they are located, but these two parts are typically stored in 2
separate files within a `report` folder at the top level of your
module\'s directory. If a module has many or multiple long report
templates, then they are often organized logically across different
files named after the report(s) they contain. All actions for the
reports are usually stored in the same file ending with `_reports.xml`,
regardless of the number of reports it contains.

Therefore, it is expected that your work tree will look something like
this:

``` bash
estate
├── models
│   ├── *.py
│   └── __init__.py
├── report
│   ├── estate_property_templates.xml
│   └── estate_property_reports.xml
├── security
│   └── ir.model.access.csv
├── views
│   └── *.xml
├── __init__.py
└── __manifest__.py
```

Don\'t forget to add whatever files your template and action view will
be into to your `__manifest__.py`. In this case, you will want to add
the files to the `data` list and remember that the files listed in a
manifest are loaded sequentially!

## Basic Report

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, we will be able to print a report
that displays all offers for a property.

![Simple PDF report](pdf_reports/simple_report.png){.align-center}
::::

In our real estate example there are many useful reports that we could
create. One simple report we can create is one that displays all of a
property\'s offers.

### Report Data

Before we do anything we first need some data to populate our reports or
else this tutorial won\'t be very interesting. When creating reports,
you will need some data to test your report code and check that the
resulting look is as expected. It is a good idea to test with data that
will cover most or all of your expected use cases. A good representation
set for our simple report is:

- At least 3 properties where 1 is \"sold\", 1 is \"offer received\" and
  1 is \"new\".
- At least 2-3 offers for our \"sold\" and \"offer received\" properties

If you don\'t have a set of data like this already, you can either:

- Complete the `define_module_data`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
  tutorial (if you haven\'t done so already) and add the extra cases to
  your demo data (you may need to create a new database to load in the
  demo data).
- Manually create the data in your database.
- Copy this [data
  file](https://github.com/odoo/technical-training-solutions/blob/{BRANCH}-J_reports/estate/data/estate_demo.xml)
  into a new directory (data) in your estate module and copy [these
  lines](https://github.com/odoo/technical-training-solutions/blob/{BRANCH}-J_reports/estate/__manifest__.py#L21-L23)
  into your \_\_manifest\_\_.py file (you may need to create a new
  database to load in the demo data).

Before continuing, click through your data in your database and make
sure your data is as expected. Of course you can add the data after you
write your report code, but then you will not be able to incrementally
test portions of your code as you write it. This can make checking for
mistakes and debugging your code more difficult in the long run for
complicated reports.

### Minimal Template

A minimal viable template is viewable under the \"Minimal viable
template\" section of the
`reference/reports/templates`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
documentation. We can modify this example to build our minimal property
offers template file:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<odoo>
    <template id="report_property_offers">
        <t t-foreach="docs" t-as="property">
            <t t-call="web.html_container">
                <t t-call="web.external_layout">
                    <div class="page">
                        <h2>
                            <span t-field="property.name"/>
                        </h2>
                        <div>
                            <strong>Expected Price: </strong>
                            <span t-field="property.expected_price"/>
                        </div>
                        <table class="table">
                            <thead>
                                <tr>
                                    <th>Price</th>
                                </tr>
                            </thead>
                            <tbody>
                                <t t-set="offers" t-value="property.mapped('offer_ids')"/>
                                <tr t-foreach="offers" t-as="offer">
                                    <td>
                                        <span t-field="offer.price"/>
                                    </td>
                                </tr>
                            </tbody>
                        </table>
                    </div>
                </t>
            </t>
        </t>
    </template>
</odoo>
```

Most of the Odoo specific (i.e. non-HTML) items in our file are
explained in the minimal viable template section. Some additional
features in our template are:

- The use of the `class="table"` attribute, so our table has some nice
  formatting. Twitter Bootstrap (we\'re using its table class in this
  case), and Font Awesome (useful for adding icons) classes can be used
  in your report template.
- The use of `t-set`, `t-value`, `t-foreach`, and `t-as` so that we can
  loop over all the `offer_ids`.

If you are already familiar with website templating engines, then the
QWeb directives (i.e. the [t-]{.title-ref} commands) probably don\'t
need much explanation and you can just look at its
`documentation <reference/qweb>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and skip
ahead to the next subsection.

Otherwise you are encouraged to read more about them (
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor) has a good
high level description), but the general idea is that QWeb provides the
ability to dynamically generate web code based on Odoo data and simple
commands. I.e. QWeb can access recordset data (and methods) and process
simple programming operations such as setting and accessing temporary
variables. For example, in the above example:

- `t-set` creates a temporary variable called \"offers\" that has its
  value set by `t-value` to the current `estate.property` recordset\'s
  `offer_ids`.
- The `t-foreach` and `t-as` usage is the equivalent to the Python:

``` Python
for offer in offers:
```

### Report Action

Now that we have a template, we need to make it accessible in our app
via a `ir.actions.report`. A practical example of `ir.actions.report` is
[here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/0e12fa135882cd5095dbf15fe2f64231c6a84336/addons/event/report/event_event_reports.xml#L20-L30)
corresponding to [this
template](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/0e12fa135882cd5095dbf15fe2f64231c6a84336/addons/event/report/event_event_templates.xml#L5).
Its contents are all explained in
`the documentation <reference/actions/report>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

An `ir.actions.report` is primarily used via the Print menu of a
model\'s view. In the practical example, the `binding_model_id`
specifies which model\'s views the report should show, and Odoo will
auto-magically add it for you. Another common use case of the report
action is to link it to a button as we learned in
`server_framework_101/09_actions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. This is
handy for reports that only make sense under specific conditions. For
example, if we wanted to make a \"Final Sale\" report, then we can link
it to a \"Print Sale Info\" button that appears in the form view only
when the property is \"Sold\".

![Print Menu Button](pdf_reports/print_menu.png){.align-center}

You may have noticed or are wondered why our report template loops
through a recordset. When our template is passed more than one record,
it can produce one PDF report for all the records. Using the Print menu
in the list view with multiple records selected will demonstrate this.

### Make a Report

Finally, you now know where to create your files and how the content of
the files should look. Happy report making!

::: exercise
Make a report.

- Add the property offers report from the minimal template subsection to
  the Print menu of the Property views.
- Improve the report by adding more data. Refer to the **Goal** of this
  section to see what additional data you can add and feel free to add
  even more.
- Bonus: Make an extra flexible report by adding in some logic so that
  when there are no offers on a property then we don\'t create a table
  and instead write something about how there are no offers yet. Hint:
  you will need to use `t-if` and `t-else`.

Remember to check that your PDF reports match your data as expected.
:::

## Sub-templates

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, we will have a sub-template that
we use in 2 reports.

![Report using a subtemplate](pdf_reports/report_subtemplate.png){.align-center}
::::

There are two main reasons for using sub-templates. One is to make the
code easier to read when working with extra-long or complicated
templates. The other is to reuse code where possible. Our simple
property offers report is useful, but listing property offers
information can be useful for more than just one report template. One
example is a report that lists all of a salesman\'s properties\' offers.

See if you can understand how to call a sub-template by reading the
`documentation <reference/qweb/sub-templates>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} on it and/or by looking at an
[example](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/0e12fa135882cd5095dbf15fe2f64231c6a84336/addons/portal/static/src/xml/portal_chatter.xml#L147-L160)
(remember QWeb uses the same control flows regardless if it is for a
report or a view in Odoo.)

::: exercise
Create and use a sub-template.

- Split the table portion of the offers into its own template. Remember
  to check that your original report still prints correctly afterwards.

- Add a new report for `res.users` that allows you to print all of the
  Real Estate Properties that are visible in their form view (i.e. in
  the \"Settings\" app). Include the offers for each of those saleman\'s
  properties in the same report. Hint: since the `binding_model_id` in
  this case will not be within the estate module, you will need to use
  `ref="base.model_res_users"`.

  Your end result should look similar to the image in the **Goal** of
  this section.

Remember to check that your reports match your data as expected!
:::

## Report Inheritance

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, we will inherit the property
report in the `estate_account` module.

![An inherited report](pdf_reports/inherited_report.png){.align-center}
::::

Inheritance in QWeb uses the same `xpath` elements as
`views inheritance <reference/view_records/inheritance>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. A QWeb template refers to its parent template in a
different way though. It is even easier to do by just adding the
`inherit_id` attribute to the `template` element and setting it equal to
the *module.parent_template_id*.

We didn\'t add any new fields to any of the estate models in
[estate_account]{.title-ref}, but we can still add information to our
existing property report. For example, we know that any \"Sold\"
properties will already have an invoice created for them, so we can add
this information to our report.

::: exercise
Inherit a report.

- Extend the property report to include some information about the
  invoice. You can look at the **Goal** of this section for inspiration
  (i.e. print a line when the property is Done, otherwise print
  nothing).

Again, remember to check that your reports match your data as expected!
:::

## Additional Features

All the following extra features are described further in the
`reference/reports/report`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} documentation,
including how to implement each of them.

### Translations

We all know Odoo is used in multiple languages thanks to automated and
manual translating. QWeb reports are no exception! Note that sometimes
the translations do not work properly if there are unnecessary spaces in
your template\'s text content, so try to avoid them when possible
(especially leading spaces).

### Reports are web pages

You probably are tired of hearing that QWeb creates HTML, but we\'re
saying it again! One of the neat features of reports being written in
QWeb is they can be viewed within the web browser. This can be useful if
you want to embed a hyperlink that leads to a specific report. Note that
the usual security checks will still apply to prevent unauthorized users
from accessing the reports.

### Barcodes

Odoo has a built-in barcode image creator that allows for barcodes to be
embedded in your reports. Check out the corresponding
[code](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/0e12fa135882cd5095dbf15fe2f64231c6a84336/addons/web/controllers/main.py#L2044-L2046)
to see all the supported barcode types.

# Restrict access to data

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

This tutorial is an extension of the
`server_framework_101`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} tutorial. Make sure
you have completed it and use the [estate]{.title-ref} module you have
built as a base for the exercises in this tutorial.
::::

So far we have mostly concerned ourselves with implementing useful
features. However in most business scenarios *security* quickly becomes
a concern: currently,

- Any employee (which is what `group_user` stands for) can create, read,
  update or delete properties, property types, or property tags.
- If `estate_account` is installed then only agents allowed to interact
  with invoicing can confirm sales as that\'s necessary to `create an
  invoice <tutorials/server_framework_101/13_other_module/create>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

However:

- We do not want third parties to be able to access properties directly.
- Not all our employees may be real-estate agents (e.g. administrative
  personnel, property managers, \...), we don\'t want non-agents to see
  the available properties.
- Real-estate agents don\'t need or get to decide what property types or
  tags are *available*.
- Real-estate agents can have *exclusive* properties, we do not want one
  agent to be able to manage another\'s exclusives.
- All real-estate agents should be able to confirm the sale of a
  property they can manage, but we do not want them to be able to
  validate or mark as paid any invoice in the system.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

We may actually be fine with some or most of these for a small business.

Because it\'s easier for users to disable unnecessary security rules
than it is to create them from nothing, it\'s better to err on the side
of caution and limit access: users can relax that access if necessary or
convenient.
::::

## Groups

::: seealso
The documentation related to this topic can be found in `the security
reference <reference/security>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

`/contributing/development/coding_guidelines`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} document the format and location of master data items.
:::

::: admonition
**Goal**

At the end of this section,

- We can make employees *real-estate agents* or *real-estate managers*.
- The `admin` user is a real-estate manager.
- We have a new *real-estate agent* employee with no access to invoicing
  or administration.
:::

It would not be practical to attach individual security rules to
employees any time we need a change so *groups* link security rules and
users. They correspond to roles that can be assigned to employees.

For most Odoo applications[^1] a good baseline is to have *user* and
*manager* (or administrator) roles: the manager can change the
configuration of the application and oversee the entirety of its use
while the user can well, use the application[^2].

This baseline seems sufficient for us:

- Real estate managers can configure the system (manage available types
  and tags) as well as oversee every property in the pipeline.
- Real estate agents can manage the properties under their care, or
  properties which are not specifically under the care of any agent.

In keeping with Odoo\'s data-driven nature, a group is no more than a
record of the `res.groups` model. They are normally part of a module\'s
`master data
<define_module_data>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, defined in one of
the module\'s data files.

As simple example [can be found

::::::: exercise
1.  Create the `security.xml` file in the appropriate folder and add it
    to the `__manifest__.py` file.
2.  If not already, add a `'category'` field to your `__manifest__.py`
    with value `Real Estate/Brokerage`.
3.  Add a record creating a group with the id `estate_group_user`, the
    name \"Agent\" and the category
    `base.module_category_real_estate_brokerage`.
4.  Below that, add a record creating a group with the id
    `estate_group_manager`, the name \"Manager\" and the category
    `base.module_category_real_estate_brokerage`. The
    `estate_group_manager` group needs to imply `estate_group_user`.

:::: note

Where does that **category** comes from ? It\'s a *module category*.
Here we used the category id
`base.module_category_real_estate_brokerage` which was automatically
generated by Odoo based on the [category]{.title-ref} set in the
`__manifest__.py` of the module. You can also find here the list of
[default module
categories](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/71da80deb044852a2af6b111d695f94aad7803ac/odoo/addons/base/data/ir_module_category_data.xml)

estate application, and possibly the Discuss (chat) application:

## Access Rights

::: seealso
The documentation related to this topic can be found at
`reference/security/acl`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
:::

::: admonition
**Goal**

At the end of this section,

- Employees who are not at least real-estate agents will not see the
  real-estate application.
- Real-estate agents will not be able to update the property types or
  tags.
:::

Access rights were first introduced in
`server_framework_101/04_securityintro`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

Access rights are a way to give users access to models *via* groups:
associate an access right to a group, then all users with that group
will have the access.

For instance we don\'t want real-estate agents to be able to modify what
property types are available, so we would not link that access to the
\"user\" group.

Access rights can only give access, they can\'t remove it: when access
is checked, the system looks to see if *any* access right associated
with the user (via any group) grants that access.

  ------- -------- ------ -------- --------
  group   create   read   update   delete
  A       X        X               
  B                X               
  C                       X        
  ------- -------- ------ -------- --------

A user with the groups A and C will be able to do anything but delete
the object while one with B and C will be able to read and update it,
but not create or delete it.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

- The group of an access right can be omitted, this means the ACL
  applies to *every user*, this is a useful but risky fallback as
  depending on the applications installed it can grant even non-users
  access to the model.
- If no access right applies to a user, they are not granted access
  (default-deny).
- If a menu item points to a model to which a user doesn\'t have access
  and has no submenus which the user can see, the menu will not be
  displayed.
::::

::::: exercise
Update the access rights file to:

- Give full access to all objects to your Real Estate Manager group.
- Give agents (real estate users) only read access to types and tags.
- Give nobody the right to delete properties.
- Check that your agent user is not able to alter types or tags, or to
  delete properties, but that they can otherwise create or update
  properties.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Remember to give different xids to your `ir.model.access` records
otherwise they will overwrite one another.
::::
:::::

Since the \"demo\" user was not made a real-estate agent or manager,
they should not even be able to see the real-estate application. Use a
private tab or window to check for this (the \"demo\" user has the
password \"demo\").

## Record Rules

::: seealso
The documentation related to this topic can be found at
`reference/security/rules`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
:::

::: admonition
**Goal**

At the end of this section, agents will not be able to see the
properties exclusive to their colleagues; but managers will still be
able to see everything.
:::

Access rights can grant access to an entire model but often we need to
be more specific: while an agent can interact with properties in general
we may not want them to update or even see properties managed by one of
their colleagues.

Record *rules* provide that precision: they can grant or reject access
to individual records:

``` xml
<record id="rule_id" model="ir.rule">
    <field name="name">A description of the rule's role</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="model_to_manage"/>
    <field name="perm_read" eval="False"/>
    <field name="groups" eval="[Command.link(ref('base.group_user'))]"/>
    <field name="domain_force">[
        '|', ('user_id', '=', user.id),
             ('user_id', '=', False)
    ]</field>
</record>
```

The `reference/orm/domains`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is how access
is managed: if the record passes then access is granted, otherwise
access is rejected.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Because rules tends to be rather complex and not created in bulk,
they\'re usually created in XML rather than the CSV used for access
rights.
::::

The rule above:

- Only applies to the \"create\", \"update\" (write) and \"delete\"
  (unlink) operations: here we want every employee to be able to see
  other users\' records but only the author / assignee can update a
  record.
- Is `non-global <reference/security/rules/global>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} so we can provide an additional rule for e.g. managers.
- Allows the operation if the current user (`user.id`) is set (e.g.
  created, or is assigned) on the record, or if the record has no
  associated user at all.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If no rule is defined or applies to a model and operation, then the
operation is allowed (*default-allow*), this can have odd effects if
access rights are not set up correctly (are too permissive).
::::

::: exercise
Define a rule which limits agents to only being able to see or modify
properties which have no salesperson, or for which they are the
salesperson.

You may want to create a second real-estate agent user, or create a few
properties for which the salesperson is a manager or some other user.

Verify that your real estate manager(s) can still see all properties. If
not, why not? Remember:

> The `estate_group_manager` group needs to imply `estate_group_user`.
:::

## Security Override

### Bypassing Security

::: admonition
**Goal**

At the end of this section, agents should be able to confirm property
sales without needing invoicing access.
:::

If you try to mark a property as \"sold\" as the real estate agent, you
should get an access error:

![](restrict_data_access/error.png)

This happens because `estate_account` tries to create an invoice during
the process, but creating an invoice requires the right to all invoice
management.

We want agents to be able to confirm a sale without them having full
invoicing access, which means we need to *bypass* the normal security
checks of Odoo in order to create an invoice *despite* the current user
not having the right to do so.

There are two main ways to bypass existing security checks in Odoo,
either wilfully or as a side-effect:

- The `sudo()` method will create a new recordset in \"sudo mode\", this
  ignores all access rights and record rules (although hard-coded group
  and user checks may still apply).
- Performing raw SQL queries will bypass access rights and record rules
  as a side-effect of bypassing the ORM itself.

::: exercise
Update `estate_account` to bypass access rights and rules when creating
the invoice.
:::

:::: danger
::: title
Danger
:::

These features should generally be avoided, and only used with extreme
care, after having checked that the current user and operation should be
able to bypass normal access rights validation.

Operations performed in such modes should also rely on user input as
little as possible, and should validate it to the maximum extent they
can.
::::

### Programmatically checking security

::: admonition
**Goal**

At the end of this section, the creation of the invoice should be
resilient to security issues regardless to changes to `estate`.
:::

In Odoo, access rights and record rules are only checked *when
performing data access via the ORM* e.g. creating, reading, searching,
writing, or unlinking a record via ORM methods. Other methods do *not*
necessarily check against any sort of access rights.

In the previous section, we bypassed the record rules when creating the
invoice in `action_sold`. This bypass can be reached by any user without
any access right being checked:

- Add a print to `action_sold` in `estate_account` before the creation
  of the invoice (as creating the invoice accesses the property,
  therefore triggers an ACL check) e.g.:

      print(" reached ".center(100, '='))

You should see `reached` in your Odoo log, followed by an access error.

:::: danger
::: title
Danger
:::

Just because you\'re already in Python code does not mean any access
right or rule has or will be checked.
::::

*Currently* the accesses are implicitly checked by accessing data on
`self` as well as calling `super()` (which does the same and *updates*
`self`), triggering access errors and cancelling the transaction
\"uncreating\" our invoice.

*However* if this changes in the future, or we add side-effects to the
method (e.g. reporting the sale to a government agency), or bugs are
introduced in `estate`, \... it would be possible for non-agents to
trigger operations they should not have access to.

Therefore when performing non-CRUD operations, or legitimately bypassing
the ORM or security, or when triggering other side-effects, it is
extremely important to perform *explicit security checks*.

Explicit security checks can be performed by:

- Checking who the current user is (`self.env.user`) and match them
  against specific models or records.
- Checking that the current user has specific groups hard-coded to allow
  or deny an operation (`self.env.user.has_group`).
- Calling `check_access(operations)` on a recordset, this verifies that
  the current user is allowed to perform the operation on *every* record
  of the set. As a special case, when the recordset is empty, it
  verifies that the current user has some access rights to perform the
  operation on the model in general.

::: exercise
Before creating the invoice, use `check_access` to ensure that the
current user can update the property the invoice is for.

Re-run the bypass script, check that the error occurs before the print.
:::

## Multi-company security {#tutorials/restrict_data_access/multicompany}

::: seealso
`reference/howtos/company`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for an overview
of multi-company facilities in general, and
`multi-company security rules <howto/company/security>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} in particular.

Documentation on rules in general can, again, be found at
`reference/security/rules`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
:::

::: admonition
**Goal**

At the end of this section, agents should only have access to properties
of their agency (or agencies).
:::

For one reason or another we might need to manage our real-estate
business as multiple companies e.g. we might have largely autonomous
agencies, a franchise setup, or multiple brands (possibly from having
acquired other real-estate businesses) which remain legally or
financially separate from one another.

Odoo can be used to manage multiple companies inside the same system,
however the actual handling is up to individual modules: Odoo itself
provides the tools to manage the issue of company-dependent fields and
*multi-company rules*, which is what we\'re going to concern ourselves
with.

We want different agencies to be \"siloed\" from one another, with
properties belonging to a given agency and users (whether agents or
managers) only able to see properties linked to their agency.

As before, because this is based on non-trivial records it\'s easier for
a user to relax rules than to tighten them so it makes sense to default
to a relatively stronger security model.

Multi-company rules are simply record rules based on the `company_ids`
or `company_id` fields:

- `company_ids` is all the companies to which the current user has
  access
- `company_id` is the currently active company (the one the user is
  currently working in / for).

Multi-company rules will *usually* use the former i.e. check if the
record is associated with *one* of the companies the user has access to:

``` xml
<record model="ir.rule" id="hr_appraisal_plan_comp_rule">
    <field name="name">Appraisal Plan multi-company</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="model_hr_appraisal_plan"/>
    <field name="domain_force">[
        '|', ('company_id', '=', False),
             ('company_id', 'in', company_ids)
    ]</field>
</record>
```

:::: danger
::: title
Danger
:::

Multi-company rules are usually
`global <reference/security/rules/global>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, otherwise there is a high risk that additional rules would
allow bypassing the multi-company rules.
::::

::: exercise
- Add a `company_id` field to `estate.property`, it should be required
  (we don\'t want agency-less properties), and should default to the
  current user\'s current company.
- Create a new company, with a new estate agent in that company.
- The manager should be a member of both companies.
- The old agent should only be a member of the old company.
- Create a few properties in each company (either use the company
  selector as the manager or use the agents). Unset the default salesman
  to avoid triggering *that* rule.
- All agents can see all companies, which is not desirable, add the
  record rule restricting this behaviour.

::::

## Visibility != security

::: admonition
**Goal**

At the end of this section, real-estate agents should not see the
Settings menu of the real-estate application, but should still be able
to set the property type or tags.
:::

Specific Odoo models can be associated directly with groups (or
companies, or users). It is important to figure out whether this
association is a *security* or a *visibility* feature before using it:

- *Visibility* features mean a user can still access the model or record
  otherwise, either through another part of the interface or by
  `performing
  operations remotely using RPC <../reference/external_api>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, things might just not be visible in the web interface in
  some contexts.
- *Security* features mean a user can not access records, fields or
  operations.

Here are some examples:

- Groups on *model fields* (in Python) are a security feature, users
  outside the group will not be able to retrieve the field, or even know
  it exists.

  Example: in server actions, [only system users can see or update
  Python
  code](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/7058e338a980268df1c502b8b2860bdd8be9f727/odoo/addons/base/models/ir_actions.py#L414-L417).

- Groups on *view elements* (in XML) are a visibility feature, users
  outside the group will not be able to see the element or its content
  in the form but they will otherwise be able to interact with the
  object (including that field).

  Example: [only managers have an immediate filter to see their teams\'
  leaves](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/8e19904bcaff8300803a7b596c02ec45fcf36ae6/addons/hr_holidays/report/hr_leave_reports.xml#L16).

- Groups on menus and actions are visibility features, the menu or
  action will not be shown in the interface but that doesn\'t prevent
  directly interacting with the underlying object.

  Example: [only system administrators can see the elearning settings
  menu](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/ff828a3e0c5386dc54e6a46fd71de9272ef3b691/addons/website_slides/views/website_slides_menu_views.xml#L64-L69).

::: exercise
Real Estate agents can not add property types or tags, but can see their
options from the Property form view when creating it.

The Settings menu just adds noise to their interface, make it only
visible to managers.
:::

Despite not having access to the Property Types and Property Tags menus
anymore, agents can still access the underlying objects since they can
still select tags or a type to set on their properties.

[^1]: An Odoo Application is a group of related modules covering a
    business area or field, usually composed of a base module and a
    number of expansions on that base to add optional or specific
    features, or link to other business areas.

[^2]: For applications which would be used by most or every employees,
    the \"application user\" role might be done away with and its
    abilities granted to all employees directly e.g. generally all
    employees can submit expenses or take time off.

# Chapter 1: Architecture Overview {#tutorials/server_framework_101/01_architecture}

## Multitier application

Odoo follows a [multitier
architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture),
meaning that the presentation, the business logic and the data storage
are separated. More specifically, it uses a three-tier architecture
(image from Wikipedia):

![Three-tier architecture](01_architecture/three_tier.svg){.align-center}

The presentation tier is a combination of HTML5, JavaScript and CSS. The
logic tier is exclusively written in Python, while the data tier only
supports PostgreSQL as an RDBMS.

Depending on the scope of your module, Odoo development can be done in
any of these tiers. Therefore, before going any further, it may be a
good idea to refresh your memory if you don\'t have an intermediate
level in these topics.

In order to go through this tutorial, you will need a very basic
knowledge of HTML and an intermediate level of Python. Advanced topics
will require more knowledge in the other subjects. There are plenty of
tutorials freely accessible, so we cannot recommend one over another
since it depends on your background.

For reference this is the official [Python
tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Since version 15.0, Odoo is actively transitioning to using its own
in-house developed [OWL framework](https://odoo.github.io/owl/) as part
of its presentation tier. The legacy JavaScript framework is still
supported but will be deprecated over time. This will be discussed
further in advanced topics.
::::

## Odoo modules

Both server and client extensions are packaged as *modules* which are
optionally loaded in a *database*. A module is a collection of functions
and data that target a single purpose.

Odoo modules can either add brand new business logic to an Odoo system
or alter and extend existing business logic. One module can be created
to add your country\'s accounting rules to Odoo\'s generic accounting
support, while a different module can add support for real-time
visualisation of a bus fleet.

Everything in Odoo starts and ends with modules.

Terminology: developers group their business features in Odoo *modules*.
The main user-facing modules are flagged and exposed as *Apps*, but a
majority of the modules aren\'t Apps. *Modules* may also be referred to
as *addons* and the directories where the Odoo server finds them form
the `addons_path`.

### Composition of a module

An Odoo module **can** contain a number of elements:

`Business objects <reference/orm>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

:   A business object (e.g. an invoice) is declared as a Python class.
    The fields defined in these classes are automatically mapped to
    database columns thanks to the
    `ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
    layer.

`Object views <../../reference/user_interface/view_architectures>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}

:   Define UI display

`Data files <reference/data>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

:   XML or CSV files declaring the model data:

    - `views <../../reference/user_interface/view_architectures>`{.interpreted-text
      role="doc"} or `reports <reference/reports>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"},
    - configuration data (modules parametrization,
      `security rules <reference/security>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"}),
    - demonstration data
    - and more

`Web controllers <reference/controllers>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

:   Handle requests from web browsers

Static web data

:   Images, CSS or JavaScript files used by the web interface or website

None of these elements are mandatory. Some modules may only add data
files (e.g. country-specific accounting configuration), while others may
only add business objects. During this training, we will create business
objects, object views and data files.

### Module structure

Each module is a directory within a *module directory*. Module
directories are specified by using the
`--addons-path <odoo-bin --addons-path>`{.interpreted-text
role="option"} option.

An Odoo module is declared by its
`manifest <reference/module/manifest>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

When an Odoo module includes business objects (i.e. Python files), they
are organized as a [Python
package](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages) with
a `__init__.py` file. This file contains import instructions for various
Python files in the module.

Here is a simplified module directory:

``` bash
module
├── models
│   ├── *.py
│   └── __init__.py
├── data
│   └── *.xml
├── __init__.py
└── __manifest__.py
```

## Odoo Editions

Odoo is available in [two versions](https://www.odoo.com/page/editions):
Odoo Enterprise (licensed & shared sources) and Odoo Community
(open-source). In addition to services such as support or upgrades, the
Enterprise version provides extra functionalities to Odoo. From a
technical point-of-view, these functionalities are simply new modules
installed on top of the modules provided by the Community version.

Ready to start? It is now time to
`write your own application <02_newapp>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}!




--- SOURCE: developer/tutorials/server_framework_101/02_newapp.md ---

# Chapter 2: A New Application

The purpose of this chapter is to lay the foundation for the creation of
a completely new Odoo module. We will start from scratch with the
minimum needed to have our module recognized by Odoo. In the upcoming
chapters, we will progressively add features to build a realistic
business case.

## The Real Estate Advertisement module

Our new module will cover a business area which is very specific and
therefore not included in the standard set of modules: real estate. It
is worth noting that before developing a new module, it is good practice
to verify that Odoo doesn\'t already provide a way to answer the
specific business case.

Here is an overview of the main list view containing some
advertisements:

![List view 01](02_newapp/overview_list_view_01.png){.align-center}

The top area of the form view summarizes important information for the
property, such as the name, the property type, the postcode and so on.
The first tab contains information describing the property: bedrooms,
living area, garage, garden\...

![Form view 01](02_newapp/overview_form_view_01.png){.align-center}

The second tab lists the offers for the property. We can see here that
potential buyers can make offers above or below the expected selling
price. It is up to the seller to accept an offer.

![Form view 02](02_newapp/overview_form_view_02.png){.align-center}

Here is a quick video showing the workflow of the module.

Hopefully, this video will be recorded soon :-)

## Prepare the addon directory

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`manifest <reference/module/manifest>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: the goal of this section is to have Odoo recognize our new
module, which will be an empty shell for now. It will be listed in the
Apps:

![The new module appears in the list](02_newapp/app_in_list.png){.align-center}
::::

The first step of module creation is to create its directory. In the
[tutorials]{.title-ref} directory, add a new directory
`estate`{.interpreted-text role="file"}.

A module must contain at least 2 files: the `__manifest__.py` file and a
`__init__.py` file. The `__init__.py` file can remain empty for now and
we\'ll come back to it in the next chapter. On the other hand, the
`__manifest__.py` file must describe our module and cannot remain empty.
Its only required field is the `name`, but it usually contains much more
information.

Take a look at the [CRM
file](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/67a952f30731fc00941587ae165b7a885da0e77e/addons/crm/__manifest__.py)
as an example. In addition to providing the description of the module
(`name`, `category`, `summary`, `website`\...), it lists its
dependencies (`depends`). A dependency means that the Odoo framework
will ensure that these modules are installed before our module is
installed. Moreover, if one of these dependencies is uninstalled, then
our module and **any other that depends on it will also be
uninstalled**. Think about your favorite Linux distribution package
manager (`apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`\...): Odoo works in the same way.

::: exercise
Create the required addon files.

Create the following folders and files:

- `/home/$USER/src/tutorials/estate/__init__.py`
- `/home/$USER/src/tutorials/estate/__manifest__.py`

The `__manifest__.py` file should only define the name and the
dependencies of our modules. The only necessary framework module for now
is `base`.
:::

Restart the Odoo server and go to Apps. Click on Update Apps List,
search for `estate` and\... tadaaa, your module appears! Did it not
appear? Maybe try removing the default \'Apps\' filter ;-)

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Remember to enable the
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} as
explained in the previous chapter. You won\'t see the
`Update Apps List`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button otherwise.
::::

::: exercise
Make your module an \'App\'.

Add the appropriate key to your `__manifest__.py` so that the module
appears when the \'Apps\' filter is on.
:::

You can even install the module! But obviously it\'s an empty shell, so
no menu will appear.

All good? If yes, then let\'s
`create our first model <03_basicmodel>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}!




--- SOURCE: developer/tutorials/server_framework_101/03_basicmodel.md ---

# Chapter 3: Models And Basic Fields

At the end of the `previous chapter <02_newapp>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, we were able to create an Odoo module. However, at this
point it is still an empty shell which doesn\'t allow us to store any
data. In our real estate module, we want to store the information
related to the properties (name, description, price, living area\...) in
a database. The Odoo framework provides tools to facilitate database
interactions.

Before moving forward in the exercise, make sure the `estate` module is
installed, i.e. it must appear as \'Installed\' in the Apps list.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Do not use mutable global variables.

A single Odoo instance can run several databases in parallel within the
same python process. Distinct modules might be installed on each of
these databases, therefore we cannot rely on global variables that would
be updated depending on installed modules.

::::

A key component of Odoo is the
[ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) layer.
This layer avoids having to manually write most
[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) and provides extensibility and
security services[^1].

Business objects are declared as Python classes extending
`~odoo.models.Model`{.interpreted-text role="class"}, which integrates
them into the automated persistence system.

Models can be configured by setting attributes in their definition. The
most important attribute is `~odoo.models.Model._name`{.interpreted-text
role="attr"}, which is required and defines the name for the model in
the Odoo system. Here is a minimum definition of a model:

    from odoo import models

    class TestModel(models.Model):
        _name = "test_model"

This definition is enough for the ORM to generate a database table named
[test_model]{.title-ref}. By convention all models are located in a
[models]{.title-ref} directory and each model is defined in its own
Python file.

Take a look at how the `crm_recurring_plan` table is defined and how the
corresponding Python file is imported:

1.  The model is defined in the file `crm/models/crm_recurring_plan.py`
    (see
    [here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/e80911aaead031e7523173789e946ac1fd27c7dc/addons/crm/models/crm_recurring_plan.py#L1-L9))
2.  The file `crm_recurring_plan.py` is imported in
    `crm/models/__init__.py` (see
    [here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/e80911aaead031e7523173789e946ac1fd27c7dc/addons/crm/models/__init__.py#L15))
3.  The folder `models` is imported in `crm/__init__.py` (see
    [here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/e80911aaead031e7523173789e946ac1fd27c7dc/addons/crm/__init__.py#L5))

::: exercise
Define the real estate properties model.

Based on example given in the CRM module, create the appropriate files
and folder for the `estate_property` table.

When the files are created, add a minimum definition for the
`estate.property` model.
:::

Any modification of the Python files requires a restart of the Odoo
server. When we restart the server, we will add the parameters `-d` and
`-u`:

``` console
$ ./odoo-bin --addons-path=addons,../enterprise/,../tutorials/ -d rd-demo -u estate
```

`-u estate` means we want to upgrade the `estate` module, i.e. the ORM
will apply database schema changes. In this case it creates a new table.
`-d rd-demo` means that the upgrade should be performed on the `rd-demo`
database. `-u` should always be used in combination with `-d`.

During the startup you should see the following warnings:

``` text
...
WARNING rd-demo odoo.models: The model estate.property has no _description
...
WARNING rd-demo odoo.modules.loading: The model estate.property has no access rules, consider adding one...
...
```

If this is the case, then you should be good! To be sure, double check
with `psql` as demonstrated in the **Goal**.

::: exercise
Add a description.

Add a `_description` to your model to get rid of one of the warnings.
:::

## Model fields

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
the `reference/orm/fields`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} API.

Fields are used to define what the model can store and where they are
stored. Fields are defined as attributes in the model class:

    from odoo import fields, models

    class TestModel(models.Model):
        _name = "test_model"
        _description = "Test Model"

        name = fields.Char()

The `name` field is a `~odoo.fields.Char`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} which will be represented as a Python unicode `str` and a
SQL `VARCHAR`.

### Types

:::: note
::: title

:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, several basic fields should have
been added to the table `estate_property`:

``` text
$ psql -d rd-demo

    "estate_property_write_uid_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (write_uid) REFERENCES res_users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
```
::::

There are two broad categories of fields: \'simple\' fields, which are
atomic values stored directly in the model\'s table, and \'relational\'
fields, which link records (of the same or different models).

Simple field examples are `~odoo.fields.Boolean`{.interpreted-text
role="class"}, `~odoo.fields.Float`{.interpreted-text role="class"},
`~odoo.fields.Char`{.interpreted-text role="class"},
`~odoo.fields.Text`{.interpreted-text role="class"},
`~odoo.fields.Date`{.interpreted-text role="class"} and
`~odoo.fields.Selection`{.interpreted-text role="class"}.

::: exercise
Add basic fields to the Real Estate Property table.

Add the following basic fields to the table:

  Field                Type
  -------------------- -----------
  name                 Char
  description          Text
  postcode             Char
  date_availability    Date
  expected_price       Float
  selling_price        Float
  bedrooms             Integer
  living_area          Integer
  facades              Integer
  garage               Boolean
  garden               Boolean
  garden_area          Integer
  garden_orientation   Selection

The `garden_orientation` field must have 4 possible values: \'North\',
\'South\', \'East\' and \'West\'. The selection list is defined as a
list of tuples, see
[here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/b0e0035b585f976e912e97e7f95f66b525bc8e43/addons/crm/report/crm_activity_report.py#L31-L34)
for an example.
:::

When the fields are added to the model, restart the server with
`-u estate`

``` console
$ ./odoo-bin --addons-path=addons,../enterprise/,../tutorials/ -d rd-demo -u estate
```

Connect to `psql` and check the structure of the table
`estate_property`. You\'ll notice that a couple of extra fields were
also added to the table. We will revisit them later.

### Common Attributes

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, the columns `name` and
`expected_price` should be not nullable in the table `estate_property`:

``` console
rd-demo=# \d estate_property;
                                            Table "public.estate_property"
    Column       |            Type             | Collation | Nullable |                   Default
--------------------+-----------------------------+-----------+----------+---------------------------------------------
...
name               | character varying           |           | not null |
...
expected_price     | double precision            |           | not null |
...
```
::::

Much like the model itself, fields can be configured by passing
configuration attributes as parameters:

    name = fields.Char(required=True)

Some attributes are available on all fields, here are the most common
ones:

`~odoo.fields.Field.string`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`str`, default: field\'s name)

:   The label of the field in UI (visible by users).

`~odoo.fields.Field.required`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`bool`, default: `False`)

:   If `True`, the field can not be empty. It must either have a default
    value or always be given a value when creating a record.

`~odoo.fields.Field.help`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`str`, default: `''`)

:   Provides long-form help tooltip for users in the UI.

`~odoo.fields.Field.index`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`bool`, default: `False`)

:   Requests that Odoo create a [database
    index](https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/preface) on the column.

::: exercise
Set attributes for existing fields.

Add the following attributes:

  Field            Attribute
  ---------------- -----------
  name             required
  expected_price   required

After restarting the server, both fields should be not nullable.
:::

### Automatic Fields

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`reference/fields/automatic`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

You may have noticed your model has a few fields you never defined. Odoo
creates a few fields in all models[^2]. These fields are managed by the
system and can\'t be written to, but they can be read if useful or
necessary:

`~odoo.fields.Model.id`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`~odoo.fields.Id`{.interpreted-text role="class"})

:   The unique identifier for a record of the model.

`~odoo.fields.Model.create_date`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`~odoo.fields.Datetime`{.interpreted-text role="class"})

:   Creation date of the record.

`~odoo.fields.Model.create_uid`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"})

:   User who created the record.

`~odoo.fields.Model.write_date`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`~odoo.fields.Datetime`{.interpreted-text role="class"})

:   Last modification date of the record.

`~odoo.fields.Model.write_uid`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} (`~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"})

:   User who last modified the record.

Now that we have created our first model, let\'s
`add some security <04_securityintro>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}!

[^1]: writing raw SQL queries is possible, but requires caution as this
    bypasses all Odoo authentication and security mechanisms.

[^2]: it is possible to `disable the automatic creation of some
    fields <reference/fields/automatic/log_access>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}




--- SOURCE: developer/tutorials/server_framework_101/04_securityintro.md ---

# Chapter 4: Security - A Brief Introduction

In the `previous chapter <03_basicmodel>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"},
we created our first table intended to store business data. In a
business application such as Odoo, one of the first questions to
consider is who[^1] can access the data. Odoo provides a security
mechanism to allow access to the data for specific groups of users.

The topic of security is covered in more detail in
`../restrict_data_access`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. This chapter
aims to cover the minimum required for our new module.

## Data Files (CSV)

Odoo is a highly data driven system. Although behavior is customized
using Python code, part of a module\'s value is in the data it sets up
when loaded. One way to load data is through a CSV file. One example is
the [list of country
states]({GITHUB_PATH}/odoo/addons/base/data/res.country.state.csv) which
is loaded at installation of the [base]{.title-ref} module.

``` text
"id","country_id:id","name","code"
state_au_1,au,"Australian Capital Territory","ACT"
state_au_2,au,"New South Wales","NSW"
state_au_3,au,"Northern Territory","NT"
state_au_4,au,"Queensland","QLD"
...
```

- `id` is an `external identifier`{.interpreted-text role="term"}. It
  can be used to refer to the record (without knowing its in-database
  identifier).
- `country_id:id` refers to the country by using its
  `external identifier`{.interpreted-text role="term"}.
- `name` is the name of the state.
- `code` is the code of the state.

These three fields are
[defined](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/2ad2f3d6567b6266fc42c6d2999d11f3066b282c/odoo/addons/base/models/res_country.py#L108-L111)
in the `res.country.state` model.

By convention, a file importing data is located in the `data` folder of
a module. When the data is related to security, it is located in the
`security` folder. When the data is related to views and actions (we
will cover this later), it is located in the `views` folder.
Additionally, all of these files must be declared in the `data` list
within the `__manifest__.py` file. Our example file is defined [in the
manifest of the base
module](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/e8697f609372cd61b045c4ee2c7f0fcfb496f58a/odoo/addons/base/__manifest__.py#L29).

Also note that the content of the data files is only loaded when a
module is installed or updated.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

The data files are sequentially loaded following their order in the
`__manifest__.py` file. This means that if data `A` refers to data `B`,
you must make sure that `B` is loaded before `A`.

In the case of the country states, you will note that the [list of
countries](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/e8697f609372cd61b045c4ee2c7f0fcfb496f58a/odoo/addons/base/__manifest__.py#L22)
is loaded **before** the [list of country
states](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/e8697f609372cd61b045c4ee2c7f0fcfb496f58a/odoo/addons/base/__manifest__.py#L29).
This is because the states refer to the countries.
::::

Why is all this important for security? Because all the security
configuration of a model is loaded through data files, as we\'ll see in
the next section.

## Access Rights

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`reference/security/acl`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, the following warning should not
appear anymore:

``` text
WARNING rd-demo odoo.modules.loading: The models ['estate.property'] have no access rules...
```
::::

When no access rights are defined on a model, Odoo determines that no
users can access the data. It is even notified in the log:

``` text
WARNING rd-demo odoo.modules.loading: The models ['estate.property'] have no access rules in module estate, consider adding some, like:
id,name,model_id:id,group_id:id,perm_read,perm_write,perm_create,perm_unlink
```

Access rights are defined as records of the model `ir.model.access`.
Each access right is associated with a model, a group (or no group for
global access) and a set of permissions: create, read, write and
unlink[^2]. Such access rights are usually defined in a CSV file named
`ir.model.access.csv`.

Here is an example for our previous \`test_model\`:

``` text
id,name,model_id/id,group_id/id,perm_read,perm_write,perm_create,perm_unlink
access_test_model,access_test_model,model_test_model,base.group_user,1,0,0,0
```

- `id` is an `external identifier`{.interpreted-text role="term"}.
- `name` is the name of the `ir.model.access`.
- `model_id/id` refers to the model which the access right applies to.
  The standard way to refer to the model is `model_<model_name>`, where
  `<model_name>` is the `_name` of the model with the `.` replaced by
  `_`. Seems cumbersome? Indeed it is\...
- `group_id/id` refers to the group which the access right applies to.
- `perm_read,perm_write,perm_create,perm_unlink`: read, write, create
  and unlink permissions

::: exercise
Add access rights.

Create the `ir.model.access.csv` file in the appropriate folder and
define it in the `__manifest__.py` file.

Give the read, write, create and unlink permissions to the group
`base.group_user`.

Tip: the warning message in the log gives you most of the solution ;-)
:::

Restart the server and the warning message should have disappeared!

It\'s now time to finally
`interact with the UI <05_firstui>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}!

[^1]: meaning which Odoo user (or group of users)

[^2]: \'unlink\' is the equivalent of \'delete\'




--- SOURCE: developer/tutorials/server_framework_101/05_firstui.md ---

# Chapter 5: Finally, Some UI To Play With

Now that we\'ve created our new
`model <03_basicmodel>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and its
corresponding `access rights <04_securityintro>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, it is time to interact with the user interface.

At the end of this chapter, we will have created a couple of menus in
order to access a default list and form view.

## Data Files (XML)

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`reference/data`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

In `04_securityintro`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, we added data
through a CSV file. The CSV format is convenient when the data to load
has a simple format. When the format is more complex (e.g. load the
structure of a view or an email template), we use the XML format. For
example, this [help
field](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/09c59012bf80d2ccbafe21c39e604d6cfda72924/addons/crm/views/crm_lost_reason_views.xml#L61-L69)
contains HTML tags. While it would be possible to load such data through
a CSV file, it is more convenient to use an XML file.

The XML files must be added to the same folders as the CSV files and
defined similarly in the `__manifest__.py`. The content of the data
files is also sequentially loaded when a module is installed or updated,
therefore all remarks made for CSV files hold true for XML files. When
the data is linked to views, we add them to the `views` folder.

In this chapter, we will load our first action and menus through an XML
file. Actions and menus are standard records in the database.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When performance is important, the CSV format is preferred over the XML
format. This is the case in Odoo where loading a CSV file is faster than
loading an XML file.
::::

In Odoo, the user interface (actions, menus and views) is largely
defined by creating and composing records defined in an XML file. A
common pattern is Menu \> Action \> View. To access records the user
navigates through several menu levels; the deepest level is an action
which triggers the opening of a list of the records.

## Actions

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`../../reference/backend/actions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, an action should be loaded in the
system. We won\'t see anything yet in the UI, but the file should be
loaded in the log:

``` text
INFO rd-demo odoo.modules.loading: loading estate/views/estate_property_views.xml
```
::::

Actions can be triggered in three ways:

1.  by clicking on menu items (linked to specific actions)
2.  by clicking on buttons in views (if these are connected to actions)
3.  as contextual actions on object

We will only cover the first case in this chapter. The second case will
be covered in a `later chapter <09_actions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} while the last is the focus of an advanced topic. In our
Real Estate example, we would like to link a menu to the
`estate.property` model, so we are able to create a new record. The
action can be viewed as the link between the menu and the model.

A basic action for our [test_model]{.title-ref} is:

``` xml
<record id="test_model_action" model="ir.actions.act_window">
    <field name="name">Test action</field>
    <field name="res_model">test_model</field>
    <field name="view_mode">list,form</field>
</record>
```

- `id` is an `external identifier`{.interpreted-text role="term"}. It
  can be used to refer to the record (without knowing its in-database
  identifier).
- `model` has a fixed value of `ir.actions.act_window`
  (`reference/actions/window`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).
- `name` is the name of the action.
- `res_model` is the model which the action applies to.
- `view_mode` are the views that will be available; in this case they
  are the list and form views. We\'ll see
  `later <14_qwebintro>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} that there can be
  other view modes.

Examples can be found everywhere in Odoo, but
[this](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/09c59012bf80d2ccbafe21c39e604d6cfda72924/addons/crm/views/crm_lost_reason_views.xml#L57-L70)
is a good example of a simple action. Pay attention to the structure of
the XML data file since you will need it in the following exercise.

::: exercise
Add an action.

Create the `estate_property_views.xml` file in the appropriate folder
and define it in the `__manifest__.py` file.

Create an action for the model `estate.property`.
:::

Restart the server and you should see the file loaded in the log.

## Menus

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`reference/data/shortcuts`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, three menus should be created and
the default view is displayed:

![Root menus](05_firstui/estate_menu_root.png){.align-center}

![First level and action menus](05_firstui/estate_menu_action.png){.align-center}

![Default form view](05_firstui/estate_form_default.png){.align-center}
::::

To reduce the complexity in declaring a menu (`ir.ui.menu`) and
connecting it to the corresponding action, we can use the `<menuitem>`
shortcut .

A basic menu for our `test_model_action` is:

``` xml
<menuitem id="test_model_menu_action" action="test_model_action"/>
```

The menu `test_model_menu_action` is linked to the action
`test_model_action`, and the action is linked to the model
[test_model]{.title-ref}. As previously mentioned, the action can be
seen as the link between the menu and the model.

However, menus always follow an architecture, and in practice there are
three levels of menus:

1.  The root menu, which is displayed in the App switcher (the Odoo
    Community App switcher is a dropdown menu)

2.  The first level menu, displayed in the top bar

3.  The action menus

    ![Root menus](05_firstui/menu_01.png){.align-center}

    ![First level and action menus](05_firstui/menu_02.png){.align-center}

The easiest way to define the structure is to create it in the XML file.
A basic structure for our `test_model_action` is:

``` xml
<menuitem id="test_menu_root" name="Test">
    <menuitem id="test_first_level_menu" name="First Level">
        <menuitem id="test_model_menu_action" action="test_model_action"/>
    </menuitem>
</menuitem>
```

The name for the third menu is taken from the name of the `action`.

::: exercise
Add menus.

Create the `estate_menus.xml` file in the appropriate folder and define
it in the `__manifest__.py` file. Remember the sequential loading of the
data files ;-)

Create the three levels of menus for the `estate.property` action
created in the previous exercise. Refer to the **Goal** of this section
for the expected result.
:::

Restart the server and **refresh the browser**[^1]. You should now see
the menus, and you\'ll even be able to create your first real estate
property advertisement!

**Goal**: at the end of this section, the selling price should be
read-only and the number of bedrooms and the availability date should
have default values. Additionally the selling price and availability
date values won\'t be copied when the record is duplicated.

![Interaction between model and view](05_firstui/attribute_and_default.gif){.align-center}

The reserved fields `active` and `state` are added to the
`estate.property` model.
::::

So far we have only used the generic view for our real estate property
advertisements, but in most cases we want to fine tune the view. There
are many fine-tunings possible in Odoo, but usually the first step is to
make sure that:

- some fields have a default value
- some fields are read-only
- some fields are not copied when duplicating the record

In our real estate business case, we would like the following:

- The selling price should be read-only (it will be automatically filled
  in later)
- The availability date and the selling price should not be copied when
  duplicating a record
- The default number of bedrooms should be 2
- The default availability date should be in 3 months

### Some New Attributes

Before moving further with the view design, let\'s step back to our
model definition. We saw that some attributes, such as `required=True`,
impact the table schema in the database. Other attributes will impact
the view or provide default values.

::: exercise
Add new attributes to the fields.

Find the appropriate attributes (see
`~odoo.fields.Field`{.interpreted-text role="class"}) to:

- set the selling price as read-only
- prevent copying of the availability date and the selling price values
:::

Restart the server and refresh the browser. You should not be able to
set any selling prices. When duplicating a record, the availability date
should be empty.

### Default Values

Any field can be given a default value. In the field definition, add the
option `default=X` where `X` is either a Python literal value (boolean,
integer, float, string) or a function taking a model and returning a
value:

    name = fields.Char(default="Unknown")
    last_seen = fields.Datetime("Last Seen", default=fields.Datetime.now)

The `name` field will have the value \'Unknown\' by default while the
`last_seen` field will be set as the current time.

::: exercise
Set default values.

Add the appropriate default attributes so that:

- the default number of bedrooms is 2
- the default availability date is in 3 months

Tip: this might help you: `~odoo.fields.Date.today`{.interpreted-text
role="meth"}
:::

Check that the default values are set as expected.

### Reserved Fields

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`reference/orm/fields/reserved`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

A few field names are reserved for pre-defined behaviors. They should be
defined on a model when the related behavior is desired.

::: exercise
Add active field.

Add the `active` field to the `estate.property` model.
:::

Restart the server, create a new property, then come back to the list
view\... The property will not be listed! `active` is an example of a
reserved field with a specific behavior: when a record has
`active=False`, it is automatically removed from any search. To display
the created property, you will need to specifically search for inactive
records.

![Inactive records](05_firstui/inactive.gif){.align-center}

::: exercise
Set a default value for active field.

Set the appropriate default value for the `active` field so it doesn\'t
disappear anymore.
:::

Note that the default `active=False` value was assigned to all existing
records.

::: exercise
Add state field.

Add a `state` field to the `estate.property` model. Five values are
possible: New, Offer Received, Offer Accepted, Sold and Cancelled. It
must be required, should not be copied and should have its default value
set to \'New\'.

Make sure to use the correct type!
:::

The `state` will be used later on for several UI enhancements.

Now that we are able to interact with the UI thanks to the default
views, the next step is obvious: we want to define
`our own views <06_basicviews>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

[^1]: A refresh is needed since the web client keeps a cache of the
    various menus and views for performance reasons.




--- SOURCE: developer/tutorials/server_framework_101/06_basicviews.md ---

# Chapter 6: Basic Views

We have seen in the `previous chapter <05_firstui>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} that Odoo is able to generate default views for a given
model. In practice, the default view is **never** acceptable for a
business application. Instead, we should at least organize the various
fields in a logical manner.

Views are defined in XML files with actions and menus. They are
instances of the `ir.ui.view` model.

In our real estate module, we need to organize the fields in a logical
way:

- in the list view, we want to display more than just the name.
- in the form view, the fields should be grouped.
- in the search view, we must be able to search on more than just the
  name. Specifically, we want a filter for the \'Available\' properties
  and a shortcut to group by postcode.

## List

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`reference/view_architectures/list`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, the list view should look like
this:

![List view](06_basicviews/list.png){.align-center}
::::

List views, also called list views, display records in a tabular form.

Their root element is `<list>`. The most basic version of this view
simply lists all the fields to display in the table (where each field is
a column):

``` xml
<list string="Tests">
    <field name="name"/>
    <field name="last_seen"/>
</list>
```

A simple example can be found
[here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/18.0/addons/crm/views/crm_lost_reason_views.xml#L45-L53).

::: exercise
Add a custom list view.

Define a list view for the `estate.property` model in the appropriate
XML file. Check the **Goal** of this section for the fields to display.

Tips:

- do not add the `editable="bottom"` attribute that you can find in the
  example above. We\'ll come back to it later.
- some field labels may need to be adapted to match the reference.
:::

As always, you need to restart the server (do not forget the `-u`
option) and refresh the browser to see the result.

You will probably use some copy-paste in this chapter, therefore always

::::

## Form

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`reference/view_architectures/form`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, the form view should look like
this:

![Form view](06_basicviews/form.png){.align-center}
::::

Forms are used to create and edit single records.

Their root element is `<form>`. They are composed of high-level
structure elements (groups and notebooks) and interactive elements
(buttons and fields):

``` xml
<form string="Test">
    <sheet>
        <group>
            <group>
                <field name="name"/>
            </group>
            <group>
                <field name="last_seen"/>
            </group>
        </group>
        <notebook>
            <page string="Description">
                <field name="description"/>
            </page>
        </notebook>
    </sheet>
</form>
```

It is possible to use regular HTML tags such as `div` and `h1` as well
as the the `class` attribute (Odoo provides some built-in classes) to
fine-tune the look.

A simple example can be found
[here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/6da14a3aadeb3efc40f145f6c11fc33314b2f15e/addons/crm/views/crm_lost_reason_views.xml#L16-L44).

::: exercise
Add a custom form view.

Define a form view for the `estate.property` model in the appropriate
XML file. Check the **Goal** of this section for the expected final
design of the page.
:::

This might require some trial and error before you get to the expected
result ;-) It is advised that you add the fields and the tags one at a
time to help understand how it works.

In order to avoid relaunching the server every time you do a
modification to the view, it can be convenient to use the `--dev xml`
parameter when launching the server:

``` console
$ ./odoo-bin --addons-path=addons,../enterprise/,../tutorials/ -d rd-demo -u estate --dev xml
```

This parameter allows you to just refresh the page to view your view
modifications.

## Search

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`reference/view_architectures/search`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, the search view should look like
this:

![Search fields](06_basicviews/search_01.png){.align-center}

![Filter](06_basicviews/search_02.png){.align-center}

![Group By](06_basicviews/search_03.png){.align-center}
::::

Search views are slightly different from the list and form views since
they don\'t display *content*. Although they apply to a specific model,
they are used to filter other views\' content (generally aggregated
views such as `reference/view_architectures/list`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}). Beyond the difference in use case, they are defined the
same way.

Their root element is `<search>`. The most basic version of this view
simply lists all the fields for which a shortcut is desired:

``` xml
<search string="Tests">
    <field name="name"/>
    <field name="last_seen"/>
</search>
```

The default search view generated by Odoo provides a shortcut to filter
by `name`. It is very common to add the fields which the user is likely
to filter on in a customized search view.

::: exercise
Add a custom search view.

Define a search view for the `estate.property` model in the appropriate
XML file. Check the first image of this section\'s **Goal** for the list
of fields.
:::

After restarting the server, it should be possible to filter on the
given fields.

Search views can also contain `<filter>` elements, which act as toggles
for predefined searches. Filters must have one of the following
attributes:

- `domain`: adds the given domain to the current search
- `context`: adds some context to the current search; uses the key
  `group_by` to group results on the given field name

A simple example can be found
[here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/715a24333bf000d5d98b9ede5155d3af32de067c/addons/delivery/views/delivery_view.xml#L30-L44).

Before going further in the exercise, it is necessary to introduce the
\'domain\' concept.

### Domains

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`reference/orm/domains`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

In Odoo, a domain encodes conditions on records: a domain is a list of
criteria used to select a subset of a model\'s records. Each criterion
is a triplet with a *field name*, an *operator* and a *value*. A record
satisfies a criterion if the specified field meets the condition of the
operator applied to the value.

For instance, when used on the *Product* model the following domain
selects all *services* with a unit price greater than *1000*:

    [('product_type', '=', 'service'), ('unit_price', '>', 1000)]

By default criteria are combined with an implicit AND, meaning *every*
criterion needs to be satisfied for a record to match a domain. The
logical operators `&` (AND), `|` (OR) and `!` (NOT) can be used to
explicitly combine criteria. They are used in prefix position (the
operator is inserted before its arguments rather than between). For
instance, to select products \'which are services *OR* have a unit price
which is *NOT* between 1000 and 2000\':

    ['|',
        ('product_type', '=', 'service'),
        '!', '&',
            ('unit_price', '>=', 1000),
            ('unit_price', '<', 2000)]

::::: note
::: title
Note
:::

XML does not allow `<` and `&` to be used inside XML elements. To avoid
parsing errors, entity references should be used: `&lt;` for `<` and
`&amp;` for `&`. Other entity references (`&gt;`, `&apos;` & `&quot;`)
are optional.

::: example
.. code-block:: xml

\<filter name=\"negative\" domain=\"\[(\'test_val\', \'&lt;\', 0)\]\"/\>
:::
:::::

::: exercise
Add filter and Group By.

The following should be added to the previously created search view:

- a filter which displays available properties, i.e. the state should be
  \'New\' or \'Offer Received\'.
- the ability to group results by postcode.
:::

Looking good? At this point we are already able to create models and
design a user interface which makes sense business-wise. However, a key
component is still missing: the
`link between models <07_relations>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.




--- SOURCE: developer/tutorials/server_framework_101/07_relations.md ---

# Chapter 7: Relations Between Models

The `previous chapter <06_basicviews>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
covered the creation of custom views for a model containing basic
fields. However, in any real business scenario we need more than one
model. Moreover, links between models are necessary. One can easily
imagine one model containing the customers and another one containing
the list of users. You might need to refer to a customer or a user on
any existing business model.

In our real estate module, we want the following information for a
property:

- the customer who bought the property
- the real estate agent who sold the property
- the property type: house, apartment, penthouse, castle\...
- a list of tags characterizing the property: cozy, renovated\...
- a list of the offers received

## Many2one

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section:

- a new `estate.property.type` model should be created with the
  corresponding menu, action and views.

![Property type](07_relations/property_type.png){.align-center}

- three Many2one fields should be added to the `estate.property` model:
  property type, buyer and seller.

![Property](07_relations/property_many2one.png){.align-center}
::::

In our real estate module, we want to define the concept of property
type. A property type is, for example, a house or an apartment. It is a
standard business need to categorize properties according to their type,
especially to refine filtering.

A property can have **one** type, but the same type can be assigned to
**many** properties. This is supported by the **many2one** concept.

A many2one is a simple link to another object. For example, in order to
define a link to the `res.partner` in our test model, we can write:

    partner_id = fields.Many2one("res.partner", string="Partner")

By convention, many2one fields have the `_id` suffix. Accessing the data
in the partner can then be easily done with:

    print(my_test_object.partner_id.name)

::: seealso
[foreign keys](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/tutorial-fk.html)
:::

In practice a many2one can be seen as a dropdown list in a form view.

::: exercise
Add the Real Estate Property Type table.

- Create the `estate.property.type` model and add the following field:

  Field   Type   Attributes
  ------- ------ ------------
  name    Char   required

- Add the menus as displayed in this section\'s **Goal**
- Add the field `property_type_id` into your `estate.property` model and
  its form, list and search views

This exercise is a good recap of the previous chapters: you need to
create a `model <03_basicmodel>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, set the
`model <04_securityintro>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, add an
`action and a menu <05_firstui>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, and
`create a view <06_basicviews>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

Tip: do not forget to import any new Python files in `__init__.py`, add
new data files in `__manifest.py__` or add the access rights ;-)
:::

Once again, restart the server and refresh to see the results!

In the real estate module, there are still two missing pieces of
information we want on a property: the buyer and the salesperson. The
buyer can be any individual, but on the other hand the salesperson must
be an employee of the real estate agency (i.e. an Odoo user).

In Odoo, there are two models which we commonly refer to:

- `res.partner`: a partner is a physical or legal entity. It can be a
  company, an individual or even a contact address.
- `res.users`: the users of the system. Users can be \'internal\', i.e.
  they have access to the Odoo backend. Or they can be \'portal\', i.e.
  they cannot access the backend, only the frontend (e.g. to access
  their previous orders in eCommerce).

::: exercise
Add the buyer and the salesperson.

Add a buyer and a salesperson to the `estate.property` model using the
two common models mentioned above. They should be added in a new tab of
the form view, as depicted in this section\'s **Goal**.

The default value for the salesperson must be the current user. The
buyer should not be copied.

Tip: to get the default value, check the note below or look at an
example
[here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/5bb8b927524d062be32f92eb326ef64091301de1/addons/crm/models/crm_lead.py#L92).
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The object `self.env` gives access to request parameters and other
useful things:

- `self.env.cr` or `self._cr` is the database *cursor* object; it is
  used for querying the database
- `self.env.uid` or `self._uid` is the current user\'s database id
- `self.env.user` is the current user\'s record
- `self.env.context` or `self._context` is the context dictionary
- `self.env.ref(xml_id)` returns the record corresponding to an XML id
- `self.env[model_name]` returns an instance of the given model
::::

Now let\'s have a look at other types of links.

## Many2many

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`~odoo.fields.Many2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section:

- a new `estate.property.tag` model should be created with the
  corresponding menu and action.

![Property tag](07_relations/property_tag.png){.align-center}

- tags should be added to the `estate.property` model:

![Property](07_relations/property_many2many.png){.align-center}
::::

In our real estate module, we want to define the concept of property
tags. A property tag is, for example, a property which is \'cozy\' or
\'renovated\'.

A property can have **many** tags and a tag can be assigned to **many**
properties. This is supported by the **many2many** concept.

A many2many is a bidirectional multiple relationship: any record on one
side can be related to any number of records on the other side. For
example, in order to define a link to the `account.tax` model on our
test model, we can write:

    tax_ids = fields.Many2many("account.tax", string="Taxes")

By convention, many2many fields have the `_ids` suffix. This means that
several taxes can be added to our test model. It behaves as a list of
records, meaning that accessing the data must be done in a loop:

    for tax in my_test_object.tax_ids:
        print(tax.name)

A list of records is known as a *recordset*, i.e. an ordered collection
of records. It supports standard Python operations on collections, such
as `len()` and `iter()`, plus extra set operations like `recs1 | recs2`.

::: exercise
Add the Real Estate Property Tag table.

- Create the `estate.property.tag` model and add the following field:

  Field   Type   Attributes
  ------- ------ ------------
  name    Char   required

- Add the menus as displayed in this section\'s **Goal**
- Add the field `tag_ids` to your `estate.property` model and in its
  form and list views

Tip: in the view, use the `widget="many2many_tags"` attribute as
demonstrated
[here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/5bb8b927524d062be32f92eb326ef64091301de1/addons/crm_iap_lead_website/views/crm_reveal_views.xml#L36).
The `widget` attribute will be explained in detail in
`a later chapter of the training <11_sprinkles>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. For now, you can try adding and removing it and see the
result ;-)
:::

## One2many

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`~odoo.fields.One2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section:

- a new `estate.property.offer` model should be created with the
  corresponding form and list view.
- offers should be added to the `estate.property` model:

![Property offers](07_relations/property_offer.png){.align-center}
::::

In our real estate module, we want to define the concept of property
offers. A property offer is an amount a potential buyer offers to the
seller. The offer can be lower or higher than the expected price.

An offer applies to **one** property, but the same property can have
**many** offers. The concept of **many2one** appears once again.
However, in this case we want to display the list of offers for a given
property so we will use the **one2many** concept.

A one2many is the inverse of a many2one. For example, we defined on our
test model a link to the `res.partner` model thanks to the field
`partner_id`. We can define the inverse relation, i.e. the list of test
models linked to our partner:

    test_ids = fields.One2many("test_model", "partner_id", string="Tests")

The first parameter is called the `comodel` and the second parameter is
the field we want to inverse.

By convention, one2many fields have the `_ids` suffix. They behave as a
list of records, meaning that accessing the data must be done in a loop:

    for test in partner.test_ids:
        print(test.name)

:::: danger
::: title
Danger
:::

Because a `~odoo.fields.One2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"} is a
virtual relationship, there *must* be a
`~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text role="class"} field defined in
the comodel.
::::

::: exercise
Add the Real Estate Property Offer table.

- Create the `estate.property.offer` model and add the following fields:

  Field         Type                           Attributes   Values
  ------------- ------------------------------ ------------ -------------------
  price         Float                                       
  status        Selection                      no copy      Accepted, Refused
  partner_id    Many2one (`res.partner`)       required     
  property_id   Many2one (`estate.property`)   required     

- Create a list view and a form view with the `price`, `partner_id` and
  `status` fields. No need to create an action or a menu.
- Add the field `offer_ids` to your `estate.property` model and in its
  form view as depicted in this section\'s **Goal**.
:::

There are several important things to notice here. First, we don\'t need
an action or a menu for all models. Some models are intended to be
accessed only through another model. This is the case in our exercise:
an offer is always accessed through a property.

Second, despite the fact that the `property_id` field is required, we
did not include it in the views. How does Odoo know which property our
offer is linked to? Well that\'s part of the magic of using the Odoo
framework: sometimes things are defined implicitly. When we create a
record through a one2many field, the corresponding many2one is populated
automatically for convenience.

Still alive? This chapter is definitely not the easiest one. It
introduced a couple of new concepts while relying on everything that was
introduced before. The
`next chapter <08_compute_onchange>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} will
be lighter, don\'t worry ;-)




--- SOURCE: developer/tutorials/server_framework_101/08_compute_onchange.md ---

# Chapter 8: Computed Fields And Onchanges

The `relations between models <07_relations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} are a key component of any Odoo module. They are necessary
for the modelization of any business case. However, we may want links
between the fields within a given model. Sometimes the value of one
field is determined from the values of other fields and other times we
want to help the user with data entry.

These cases are supported by the concepts of computed fields and
onchanges. Although this chapter is not technically complex, the
semantics of both concepts is very important. This is also the first
time we will write Python logic. Until now we haven\'t written anything
other than class definitions and field declarations.

## Computed Fields

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`reference/fields/compute`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section:

- In the property model, the total area and the best offer should be
  computed:

![Compute fields](08_compute_onchange/compute.gif){.align-center}

- In the property offer model, the validity date should be computed and
  can be updated:

![Compute field with inverse](08_compute_onchange/compute_inverse.gif){.align-center}
::::

In our real estate module, we have defined the living area as well as
the garden area. It is then natural to define the total area as the sum
of both fields. We will use the concept of a computed field for this,
i.e. the value of a given field will be computed from the value of other
fields.

So far fields have been stored directly in and retrieved directly from
the database. Fields can also be *computed*. In this case, the field\'s
value is not retrieved from the database but computed on-the-fly by
calling a method of the model.

To create a computed field, create a field and set its attribute
`~odoo.fields.Field.compute`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} to the name
of a method. The computation method should set the value of the computed
field for every record in `self`.

By convention, `~odoo.fields.Field.compute`{.interpreted-text
role="attr"} methods are private, meaning that they cannot be called
from the presentation tier, only from the business tier (see
`tutorials/server_framework_101/01_architecture`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}). Private methods have a name starting with an underscore
`_`.

### Dependencies

The value of a computed field usually depends on the values of other
fields in the computed record. The ORM expects the developer to specify
those dependencies on the compute method with the decorator
`~odoo.api.depends`{.interpreted-text role="func"}. The given
dependencies are used by the ORM to trigger the recomputation of the
field whenever some of its dependencies have been modified:

    from odoo import api, fields, models

    class TestComputed(models.Model):
        _name = "test.computed"

        total = fields.Float(compute="_compute_total")
        amount = fields.Float()

        @api.depends("amount")
        def _compute_total(self):
            for record in self:
                record.total = 2.0 * record.amount

:::: {.note .aphorism}
::: title
Note

`self` is a collection.

The object `self` is a *recordset*, i.e. an ordered collection of
records. It supports the standard Python operations on collections, e.g.
`len(self)` and `iter(self)`, plus extra set operations such as
`recs1 | recs2`.

Iterating over `self` gives the records one by one, where each record is
itself a collection of size 1. You can access/assign fields on single
records by using the dot notation, e.g. `record.name`.
::::

Many examples of computed fields can be found in Odoo.
[Here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/713dd3777ca0ce9d121d5162a3d63de3237509f4/addons/account/models/account_move.py#L3420-L3423)
is a simple one.

::: exercise
Compute the total area.

- Add the `total_area` field to `estate.property`. It is defined as the
  sum of the `living_area` and the `garden_area`.
- Add the field in the form view as depicted on the first image of this
  section\'s **Goal**.
:::

For relational fields it\'s possible to use paths through a field as a
dependency:

    description = fields.Char(compute="_compute_description")
    partner_id = fields.Many2one("res.partner")

    @api.depends("partner_id.name")
    def _compute_description(self):
        for record in self:
            record.description = "Test for partner %s" % record.partner_id.name

The example is given with a `~odoo.fields.Many2one`{.interpreted-text
role="class"}, but it is valid for
`~odoo.fields.Many2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"} or a
`~odoo.fields.One2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"}. An example can
be found

Let\'s try it in our module with the following exercise!

::: exercise
Compute the best offer.

- Add the `best_price` field to `estate.property`. It is defined as the
  highest (i.e. maximum) of the offers\' `price`.
- Add the field to the form view as depicted in the first image of this
  section\'s **Goal**.

Tip: you might want to try using the
`~odoo.models.BaseModel.mapped`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} method.

for a simple example.
:::

### Inverse Function

You might have noticed that computed fields are read-only by default.
This is expected since the user is not supposed to set a value.

In some cases, it might be useful to still be able to set a value
directly. In our real estate example, we can define a validity duration
for an offer and set a validity date. We would like to be able to set
either the duration or the date with one impacting the other.

To support this Odoo provides the ability to use an `inverse` function:

    from odoo import api, fields, models

    class TestComputed(models.Model):
        _name = "test.computed"

        total = fields.Float(compute="_compute_total", inverse="_inverse_total")
        amount = fields.Float()

        @api.depends("amount")
        def _compute_total(self):
            for record in self:
                record.total = 2.0 * record.amount

        def _inverse_total(self):
            for record in self:
                record.amount = record.total / 2.0

An example can be found
[here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/2ccf0bd0dcb2e232ee894f07f24fdc26c51835f7/addons/crm/models/crm_lead.py#L308-L317).

A compute method sets the field while an inverse method sets the
field\'s dependencies.

Note that the `inverse` method is called when saving the record, while
the `compute` method is called at each change of its dependencies.

::: exercise
Compute a validity date for offers.

- Add the following fields to the `estate.property.offer` model:

  Field           Type      Default
  --------------- --------- ---------
  validity        Integer   7
  date_deadline   Date      

Where `date_deadline` is a computed field which is defined as the sum of
two fields from the offer: the `create_date` and the `validity`. Define
an appropriate inverse function so that the user can set either the date
or the validity.

Tip: the `create_date` is only filled in when the record is created,
therefore you will need a fallback to prevent crashing at time of
creation.

- Add the fields in the form view and the list view as depicted on the
  second image of this section\'s **Goal**.
:::

### Additional Information

Computed fields are **not stored** in the database by default. Therefore
it is **not possible** to search on a computed field unless a `search`
method is defined. This topic is beyond the scope of this training, so
we won\'t cover it. An example can be found
[here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/f011c9aacf3a3010c436d4e4f408cd9ae265de1b/addons/event/models/event_event.py#L188).

Another solution is to store the field with the `store=True` attribute.
While this is usually convenient, pay attention to the potential
computation load added to your model. Lets re-use our example:

    description = fields.Char(compute="_compute_description", store=True)
    partner_id = fields.Many2one("res.partner")

    @api.depends("partner_id.name")
    def _compute_description(self):
        for record in self:
            record.description = "Test for partner %s" % record.partner_id.name

Every time the partner `name` is changed, the `description` is
automatically recomputed for **all the records** referring to it! This
can quickly become prohibitive to recompute when millions of records
need recomputation.

It is also worth noting that a computed field can depend on another
computed field. The ORM is smart enough to correctly recompute all the
dependencies in the right order\... but sometimes at the cost of
degraded performance.

In general performance must always be kept in mind when defining
computed fields. The more complex is your field to compute (e.g. with a
lot of dependencies or when a computed field depends on other computed
fields), the more time it will take to compute. Always take some time to
evaluate the cost of a computed field beforehand. Most of the time it is
only when your code reaches a production server that you realize it
slows down a whole process. Not cool :-(

## Onchanges

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`~odoo.api.onchange`{.interpreted-text role="func"}:

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, enabling the garden will set a
default area of 10 and an orientation to North.

![Onchange](08_compute_onchange/onchange.gif){.align-center}
::::

In our real estate module, we also want to help the user with data
entry. When the \'garden\' field is set, we want to give a default value
for the garden area as well as the orientation. Additionally, when the
\'garden\' field is unset we want the garden area to reset to zero and
the orientation to be removed. In this case, the value of a given field
modifies the value of other fields.

The \'onchange\' mechanism provides a way for the client interface to
update a form without saving anything to the database whenever the user
has filled in a field value. To achieve this, we define a method where
`self` represents the record in the form view and decorate it with
`~odoo.api.onchange`{.interpreted-text role="func"} to specify which
field it is triggered by. Any change you make on `self` will be
reflected on the form:

    from odoo import api, fields, models

    class TestOnchange(models.Model):
        _name = "test.onchange"

        name = fields.Char(string="Name")
        description = fields.Char(string="Description")
        partner_id = fields.Many2one("res.partner", string="Partner")

        @api.onchange("partner_id")
        def _onchange_partner_id(self):
            self.name = "Document for %s" % (self.partner_id.name)
            self.description = "Default description for %s" % (self.partner_id.name)

In this example, changing the partner will also change the name and the
description values. It is up to the user whether or not to change the
name and description values afterwards. Also note that we do not loop on
`self`, this is because the method is only triggered in a form view,
where `self` is always a single record.

::: exercise
Set values for garden area and orientation.

Create an `onchange` in the `estate.property` model in order to set
values for the garden area (10) and orientation (North) when garden is
set to True. When unset, clear the fields.
:::

### Additional Information

Onchanges methods can also return a non-blocking warning message
([example](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/cd9af815ba591935cda367d33a1d090f248dd18d/addons/payment_authorize/models/payment.py#L34-L36)).

## How to use them?

There is no strict rule for the use of computed fields and onchanges.

In many cases, both computed fields and onchanges may be used to achieve
the same result. Always prefer computed fields since they are also
triggered outside of the context of a form view. Never ever use an
onchange to add business logic to your model. This is a **very bad**
idea since onchanges are not automatically triggered when creating a
record programmatically; they are only triggered in the form view.

The usual pitfall of computed fields and onchanges is trying to be \'too
smart\' by adding too much logic. This can have the opposite result of
what was expected: the end user is confused from all the automation.

Computed fields tend to be easier to debug: such a field is set by a
given method, so it\'s easy to track when the value is set. Onchanges,
on the other hand, may be confusing: it is very difficult to know the
extent of an onchange. Since several onchange methods may set the same
fields, it easily becomes difficult to track where a value is coming
from.

When using stored computed fields, pay close attention to the
dependencies. When computed fields depend on other computed fields,
changing a value can trigger a large number of recomputations. This
leads to poor performance.

In the `next chapter <09_actions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, we\'ll
see how we can trigger some business logic when buttons are clicked.




--- SOURCE: developer/tutorials/server_framework_101/09_actions.md ---

# Chapter 9: Ready For Some Action?

So far we have mostly built our module by declaring fields and views. We
just introduced business logic in the
`previous chapter <08_compute_onchange>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
thanks to computed fields and onchanges. In any real business scenario,
we would want to link some business logic to action buttons. In our real
estate example, we would like to be able to:

- cancel or set a property as sold
- accept or refuse an offer

One could argue that we can already do these things by changing the
state manually, but this is not really convenient. Moreover, we want to
add some extra processing: when an offer is accepted we want to set the
selling price and the buyer for the property.

## Object Type

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`../../reference/backend/actions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
`reference/exceptions`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section:

- You should be able to cancel or set a property as sold:

![Cancel and set to sold](09_actions/property.gif){.align-center}

A cancelled property cannot be sold and a sold property cannot be
cancelled. For the sake of clarity, the `state` field has been added on
the view.

- You should be able to accept or refuse an offer:

![Accept or refuse an offer](09_actions/offer_01.gif){.align-center}

- Once an offer is accepted, the selling price and the buyer should be
  set:

![Accept an offer](09_actions/offer_02.gif){.align-center}
::::

In our real estate module, we want to link business logic with some
buttons. The most common way to do this is to:

- Add a button in the view, for example in the `header` of the view:

``` xml
<form>
    <header>
        <button name="action_do_something" type="object" string="Do Something"/>
    </header>
    <sheet>
        <field name="name"/>
    </sheet>
</form>
```

- and link this button to business logic:

``` python
from odoo import fields, models

class TestAction(models.Model):
    _name = "test.action"

    name = fields.Char()

    def action_do_something(self):
        for record in self:
            record.name = "Something"
        return True
```

By assigning `type="object"` to our button, the Odoo framework will
execute a Python method with `name="action_do_something"` on the given
model.

The first important detail to note is that our method name isn\'t
prefixed with an underscore (`_`). This makes our method a **public**
method, which can be called directly from the Odoo interface (through an
RPC call). Until now, all methods we created (compute, onchange) were
called internally, so we used **private** methods prefixed by an
underscore. You should always define your methods as private unless they
need to be called from the user interface.

Also note that we loop on `self`. Always assume that a method can be
called on multiple records; it\'s better for reusability.

Finally, a public method should always return something so that it can
be called through XML-RPC. When in doubt, just `return True`.

There are hundreds of examples in the Odoo source code. One example is
this [button in a
view](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/cd9af815ba591935cda367d33a1d090f248dd18d/addons/crm/views/crm_lead_views.xml#L9-L11)
and its [corresponding Python
method](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/cd9af815ba591935cda367d33a1d090f248dd18d/addons/crm/models/crm_lead.py#L746-L760)

::: exercise
Cancel and set a property as sold.

- Add the buttons \'Cancel\' and \'Sold\' to the `estate.property`
  model. A cancelled property cannot be set as sold, and a sold property
  cannot be cancelled.

  Refer to the first image of the **Goal** for the expected result.

  Tip: in order to raise an error, you can use the
  `UserError<reference/exceptions>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  function. There are plenty of examples in the Odoo source code ;-)

- Add the buttons \'Accept\' and \'Refuse\' to the
  `estate.property.offer` model.

  Refer to the second image of the **Goal** for the expected result.

  Tip: to use an icon as a button, have a look [at this
  example](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/cd9af815ba591935cda367d33a1d090f248dd18d/addons/event/views/event_views.xml#L521).

- When an offer is accepted, set the buyer and the selling price for the
  corresponding property.

  Refer to the third image of the **Goal** for the expected result.

  Pay attention: in real life only one offer can be accepted for a given
  property!
:::

## Action Type

In `05_firstui`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, we created an action that
was linked to a menu. You may be wondering if it is possible to link an
action to a button. Good news, it is! One way to do it is:

``` xml
<button type="action" name="%(test.test_model_action)d" string="My Action"/>
```

We use `type="action"` and we refer to the
`external identifier`{.interpreted-text role="term"} in the `name`.

In the `next chapter <10_constraints>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
we\'ll see how we can prevent encoding incorrect data in Odoo.




--- SOURCE: developer/tutorials/server_framework_101/10_constraints.md ---

# Chapter 10: Constraints

The `previous chapter <09_actions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
introduced the ability to add some business logic to our model. We can
now link buttons to business code, but how can we prevent users from
entering incorrect data? For example, in our real estate module nothing
prevents users from setting a negative expected price.

Odoo provides two ways to set up automatically verified invariants:
`Python constraints <odoo.api.constrains>`{.interpreted-text
role="func"} and
`SQL constraints <odoo.models.Constraint>`{.interpreted-text
role="attr"}.

## SQL

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`reference/orm/models`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and in the
[PostgreSQL\'s
documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/ddl-constraints.html).

**Goal**: at the end of this section:

- Property types and tags should have a unique name

![Constraints on names](10_constraints/sql_02.gif){.align-center}
::::

SQL objects are defined through
`~odoo.models.Constraint`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} attributes.

Simple example:

``` python
_check_percentage = models.Constraint(
    'CHECK(percentage >= 0 AND percentage <= 100)',
    'The percentage of an analytic distribution should be between 0 and 100.',
)
```

::: exercise
Add SQL constraints.

Add the following constraints to their corresponding models:

- A property expected price must be strictly positive
- A property selling price must be positive
- An offer price must be strictly positive
- A property tag name and property type name must be unique

Tip: search for the `unique` keyword in the Odoo codebase for examples
of unique names.
:::

Restart the server with the `-u estate` option to see the result. Note
that you might have data that prevents a SQL constraint from being set.
An error message similar to the following might pop up:

``` text
ERROR rd-demo odoo.schema: Table 'estate_property_offer': unable to add constraint 'estate_property_offer_check_price' as CHECK(price > 0)
```

For example, if some offers have a price of zero, then the constraint
can\'t be applied. You can delete the problematic data in order to apply
the new constraints.

## Python

`~odoo.api.constrains`{.interpreted-text role="func"}.

::::

SQL constraints are an efficient way of ensuring data consistency.
However it may be necessary to make more complex checks which require
Python code. In this case we need a Python constraint.

A Python constraint is defined as a method decorated with
`~odoo.api.constrains`{.interpreted-text role="func"} and is invoked on
a recordset. The decorator specifies which fields are involved in the
constraint. The constraint is automatically evaluated when any of these
fields are modified . The method is expected to raise an exception if
its invariant is not satisfied:

    from odoo.exceptions import ValidationError

    ...

    @api.constrains('date_end')
    def _check_date_end(self):
        for record in self:
            if record.date_end < fields.Date.today():
                raise ValidationError("The end date cannot be set in the past")
        # all records passed the test, don't return anything

::::: exercise
Add Python constraints.

Add a constraint so that the selling price cannot be lower than 90% of
the expected price.

Tip: the selling price is zero until an offer is validated. You will
need to fine tune your check to take this into account.

floats!

:::::

SQL constraints are usually more efficient than Python constraints. When
performance matters, always prefer SQL over Python constraints.

Our real estate module is starting to look good. We added some business
logic, and now we make sure the data is consistent. However, the user
interface is still a bit rough. Let\'s see how we can improve it in the
`next chapter <11_sprinkles>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.




--- SOURCE: developer/tutorials/server_framework_101/11_sprinkles.md ---

# Chapter 11: Add The Sprinkles

Our real estate module now makes sense from a business perspective. We
created `specific views <06_basicviews>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"},
added several `action buttons <09_actions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and `constraints <10_constraints>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. However our user interface is still a bit rough. We would
like to add some colors to the list views and make some fields and
buttons conditionally disappear. For example, the \'Sold\' and
\'Cancel\' buttons should disappear when the property is sold or
cancelled since it is no longer allowed to change the state at this
point.

This chapter covers a very small subset of what can be done in the
views. Do not hesitate to read the reference documentation for a more
complete overview.

**Reference**: the documentation related to this chapter can be found in
`../../reference/user_interface/view_records`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and
`../../reference/user_interface/view_architectures`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

## Inline Views

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, a specific list of properties
should be added to the property type view:

![Inline list view](11_sprinkles/inline_view.png){.align-center}
::::

In the real estate module we added a list of offers for a property. We
simply added the field `offer_ids` with:

``` xml
<field name="offer_ids"/>
```

The field uses the specific view for `estate.property.offer`. In some
cases we want to define a specific list view which is only used in the
context of a form view. For example, we would like to display the list
of properties linked to a property type. However, we only want to
display 3 fields for clarity: name, expected price and state.

To do this, we can define *inline* list views. An inline list view is
defined directly inside a form view. For example:

``` python
from odoo import fields, models

class TestModel(models.Model):
    _name = "test_model"
    _description = "Test Model"

    description = fields.Char()
    line_ids = fields.One2many("test_model_line", "model_id")


class TestModelLine(models.Model):
    _name = "test_model_line"
    _description = "Test Model Line"

    model_id = fields.Many2one("test_model")
    field_1 = fields.Char()
    field_2 = fields.Char()
    field_3 = fields.Char()
```

``` xml
<form>
    <field name="description"/>
    <field name="line_ids">
        <list>
            <field name="field_1"/>
            <field name="field_2"/>
        </list>
    </field>
</form>
```

In the form view of the [test_model]{.title-ref}, we define a specific
list view for [test_model_line]{.title-ref} with fields `field_1` and
`field_2`.

An example can be found
[here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/0e12fa135882cd5095dbf15fe2f64231c6a84336/addons/event/views/event_tag_views.xml#L27-L33).

::: exercise
Add an inline list view.

- Add the `One2many` field `property_ids` to the `estate.property.type`
  model.
- Add the field in the `estate.property.type` form view as depicted in
  the **Goal** of this section.

## Widgets

**Reference**: the documentation related to this section can be found in
`reference/js/widgets`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, the state of the property should
be displayed using a specific widget:

![Statusbar widget](11_sprinkles/widget.png){.align-center}

Four states are displayed: New, Offer Received, Offer Accepted and Sold.
::::

Whenever we\'ve added fields to our models, we\'ve (almost) never had to
worry about how these fields would look like in the user interface. For
example, a date picker is provided for a `Date` field and a `One2many`
field is automatically displayed as a list. Odoo chooses the right
\'widget\' depending on the field type.

However, in some cases, we want a specific representation of a field
which can be done thanks to the `widget` attribute. We already used it
for the `tag_ids` field when we used the `widget="many2many_tags"`
attribute. If we hadn\'t used it, then the field would have displayed as
a list.

Each field type has a set of widgets which can be used to fine tune its
display. Some widgets also take extra options. An exhaustive list can be
found in `reference/js/widgets`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

::: exercise
Use the status bar widget.

Use the `statusbar` widget in order to display the `state` of the
`estate.property` as depicted in the **Goal** of this section.

Same field multiple times in a view

## List Order

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, all lists should display by
default in a deterministic order. Property types can be ordered
manually.
::::

During the previous exercises, we created several list views. However,
at no point did we specify which order the records had to be listed in
by default. This is a very important thing for many business cases. For
example, in our real estate module we would want to display the highest
offers on top of the list.

### Model

Odoo provides several ways to set a default order. The most common way
is to define the `_order` attribute directly in the model. This way, the
retrieved records will follow a deterministic order which will be
consistent in all views including when records are searched
programmatically. By default there is no order specified, therefore the
records will be retrieved in a non-deterministic order depending on
PostgreSQL.

The `_order` attribute takes a string containing a list of fields which
will be used for sorting. It will be converted to an
[order_by](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/queries-order.html) clause
in SQL. For example:

``` python
from odoo import fields, models

class TestModel(models.Model):
    _name = "test_model"
    _description = "Test Model"
    _order = "id desc"

    description = fields.Char()
```

Our records are ordered by descending `id`, meaning the highest comes
first.

Add model ordering.

Define the following orders in their corresponding models:

  Model                     Order
  ------------------------- ------------------
  `estate.property`         Descending ID
  `estate.property.offer`   Descending Price
  `estate.property.tag`     Name
  `estate.property.type`    Name
:::

### View

Ordering is possible at the model level. This has the advantage of a
consistent order everywhere a list of records is retrieved. However, it
is also possible to define a specific order directly in a view thanks to
the `default_order` attribute
([example](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/892dd6860733c46caf379fd36f57219082331b66/addons/crm/report/crm_activity_report_views.xml#L30)).

### Manual

Both model and view ordering allow flexibility when sorting records, but
there is still one case we need to cover: the manual ordering. A user
may want to sort records depending on the business logic. For example,
in our real estate module we would like to sort the property types
manually. It is indeed useful to have the most used types appear at the
top of the list. If our real estate agency mainly sells houses, it is
more convenient to have \'House\' appear before \'Apartment\'.

To do so, a `sequence` field is used in combination with the `handle`
widget. Obviously the `sequence` field must be the first field in the
`_order` attribute.

::: exercise
Add manual ordering.

- Add the following field:

  Model                    Field      Type
  ------------------------ ---------- ---------
  `estate.property.type`   Sequence   Integer

- Add the sequence to the `estate.property.type` list view with the
  correct widget.

Tip: you can find an example here:
[model](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/892dd6860733c46caf379fd36f57219082331b66/addons/crm/models/crm_stage.py#L36)
and
[view](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/892dd6860733c46caf379fd36f57219082331b66/addons/crm/views/crm_stage_views.xml#L23).
:::

## Attributes and options

It would be prohibitive to detail all the available features which allow
fine tuning of the look of a view. Therefore, we\'ll stick to the most
common ones.

### Form

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, the property form view will have:

- Conditional display of buttons and fields
- Tag colors

![Form view with sprinkles](11_sprinkles/form.gif){.align-center}
::::

In our real estate module, we want to modify the behavior of some
fields. For example, we don\'t want to be able to create or edit a
property type from the form view. Instead we expect the types to be
handled in their appropriate menu. We also want to give tags a color. In
order to add these behavior customizations, we can add the `options`
attribute to several field widgets.

::: exercise
Add widget options.

- Add the appropriate option to the `property_type_id` field to prevent
  the creation and the editing of a property type from the property form
  view. Have a look at the
  `Many2one widget documentation <reference/js/widgets>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} for more info.
- Add the following field:

  Model                   Field   Type
  ----------------------- ------- ---------
  `estate.property.tag`   Color   Integer

Then add the appropriate option to the `tag_ids` field to add a color
picker on the tags. Have a look at the
`FieldMany2ManyTags widget documentation <reference/js/widgets>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for more info.
:::

In `05_firstui`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, we saw that reserved
fields were used for specific behaviors. For example, the `active` field
is used to automatically filter out inactive records. We added the
`state` as a reserved field as well. It\'s now time to use it! A `state`
field can be used in combination with an `invisible` attribute in the
view to display buttons conditionally.

::: exercise
Add conditional display of buttons.

Use the `invisible` attribute to display the header buttons
conditionally as depicted in this section\'s **Goal** (notice how the
\'Sold\' and \'Cancel\' buttons change when the state is modified).

Tip: do not hesitate to search for `invisible=` in the Odoo XML files
for some examples.
:::

More generally, it is possible to make a field `invisible`, `readonly`
or `required` based on the value of other fields. Note that `invisible`
can also be applied to other elements of the view such as `button` or
`group`.

[invisible]{.title-ref}, [readonly]{.title-ref} and
[required]{.title-ref} can have any Python expression as value. The
expression gives the condition in which the property applies. For
example:

``` xml
<form>
    <field name="description" invisible="not is_partner"/>
</form>
```

This means that the `description` field is invisible when `is_partner`
is `False`. It is important to note that a field used in `invisible`
**must** be present in the view. If it should not be displayed to the
user, we can use the `invisible` attribute to hide it.

::: exercise
Use `invisible`.

- Make the garden area and orientation invisible in the
  `estate.property` form view when there is no garden.
- Make the \'Accept\' and \'Refuse\' buttons invisible once the offer
  state is set.
- Do not allow adding an offer when the property state is \'Offer
  Accepted\', \'Sold\' or \'Cancelled\'. To do this use the `readonly`
  attribute.
:::

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Using a (conditional) `readonly` attribute in the view can be useful to
prevent data entry errors, but keep in mind that it doesn\'t provide any
level of security! There is no check done server-side, therefore it\'s
always possible to write on the field through a RPC call.
::::

### List

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, the property and offer list views
should have color decorations. Additionally, offers and tags will be
editable directly in the list, and the availability date will be hidden
by default.

![List view with decorations and optional field](11_sprinkles/decoration.png){.align-center}

![Editable list](11_sprinkles/editable_list.gif){.align-center}
::::

When the model only has a few fields, it can be useful to edit records
directly through the list view and not have to open the form view. In
the real estate example, there is no need to open a form view to add an
offer or create a new tag. This can be achieved thanks to the `editable`
attribute.

::: exercise
Make list views editable.

Make the `estate.property.offer` and `estate.property.tag` list views
editable.
:::

On the other hand, when a model has a lot of fields it can be tempting
to add too many fields in the list view and make it unclear. An
alternative method is to add the fields, but make them optionally
hidden. This can be achieved thanks to the `optional` attribute.

::: exercise
Make a field optional.

Make the field `date_availability` on the `estate.property` list view
optional and hidden by default.
:::

Finally, color codes are useful to visually emphasize records. For
example, in the real estate module we would like to display refused
offers in red and accepted offers in green. This can be achieved thanks
to the `decoration-{$name}` attribute (see
`reference/js/widgets`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for a complete
list):

``` xml
<list decoration-success="is_partner==True">
    <field name="name"/>
</list>
```

The records where `is_partner` is `True` will be displayed in green.

::: exercise
Add some decorations.

On the `estate.property` list view:

- Properties with an offer received are green
- Properties with an offer accepted are green and bold
- Properties sold are muted

On the `estate.property.offer` list view:

- Refused offers are red
- Accepted offers are green
- The state should not be visible anymore

Tips:

- Keep in mind that **all** fields used in attributes must be in the
  view!
- If you want to test the color of the \"Offer Received\" and \"Offer
  Accepted\" states, add the field in the form view and change it
  manually (we\'ll implement the business logic for this later).
:::

### Search

**Reference**: the documentation related to this section can be found in
`reference/view_architectures/search`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`reference/view_architectures/search/defaults`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, the available properties will be
filtered by default, and searching on the living area returns results
where the area is larger than the given number.

![Default filters and domains](11_sprinkles/search.gif){.align-center}
::::

Last but not least, there are some tweaks we would like to apply when
searching. First of all, we want to have our \'Available\' filter
applied by default when we access the properties. To make this happen,
we need to use the `search_default_{$name}` action context, where
`{$name}` is the filter name. This means that we can define which
filter(s) will be activated by default at the action level.

Here is an example of an
[action](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/6decc32a889b46947db6dd4d42ef995935894a2a/addons/crm/report/crm_opportunity_report_views.xml#L115)
with its [corresponding
filter](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/6decc32a889b46947db6dd4d42ef995935894a2a/addons/crm/report/crm_opportunity_report_views.xml#L68).

::: exercise
Add a default filter.

Make the \'Available\' filter selected by default in the
`estate.property` action.
:::

Another useful improvement in our module would be the ability to search
efficiently by living area. In practice, a user will want to search for
properties of \'at least\' the given area. It is unrealistic to expect
users would want to find a property of an exact living area. It is
always possible to make a custom search, but that\'s inconvenient.

Search view `<field>` elements can have a `filter_domain` that overrides
the domain generated for searching on the given field. In the given
domain, `self` represents the value entered by the user. In the example
below, it is used to search on both `name` and `description` fields.

``` xml
<search string="Test">
    <field name="description" string="Name and description"
           filter_domain="['|', ('name', 'ilike', self), ('description', 'ilike', self)]"/>
</search>
```

::: exercise
Change the living area search.

Add a `filter_domain` to the living area to include properties with an
area equal to or greater than the given value.
:::

## Stat Buttons

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, there will be a stat button on the
property type form view which shows the list of all offers related to
properties of the given type when it is clicked on.

![Stat button](11_sprinkles/stat_button.gif){.align-center}
::::

If you\'ve already used some functional modules in Odoo, you\'ve
probably already encountered a \'stat button\'. These buttons are
displayed on the top right of a form view and give a quick access to
linked documents. In our real estate module, we would like to have a
quick link to the offers related to a given property type as depicted in
the **Goal** of this section.

At this point of the tutorial we have already seen most of the concepts
to do this. However, there is not a single solution and it can still be
confusing if you don\'t know where to start from. We\'ll describe a
step-by-step solution in the exercise. It can always be useful to find
some examples in the Odoo codebase by looking for `oe_stat_button`.

The following exercise might be a bit more difficult than the previous
ones since it assumes you are able to search for examples in the source
code on your own. If you are stuck there is probably someone nearby who
can help you ;-)

The exercise introduces the concept of
`reference/fields/related`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. The easiest
way to understand it is to consider it as a specific case of a computed
field. The following definition of the `description` field:

``` python
...

partner_id = fields.Many2one("res.partner", string="Partner")
description = fields.Char(related="partner_id.name")
```

is equivalent to:

``` python
...

partner_id = fields.Many2one("res.partner", string="Partner")
description = fields.Char(compute="_compute_description")

@api.depends("partner_id.name")
def _compute_description(self):
    for record in self:
        record.description = record.partner_id.name
```

Every time the partner name is changed, the description is modified.

::: exercise
Add a stat button to property type.

- Add the field `property_type_id` to `estate.property.offer`. We can
  define it as a related field on `property_id.property_type_id` and set
  it as stored.

Thanks to this field, an offer will be linked to a property type when
it\'s created. You can add the field to the list view of offers to make
sure it works.

- Add the field `offer_ids` to `estate.property.type` which is the
  One2many inverse of the field defined in the previous step.
- Add the field `offer_count` to `estate.property.type`. It is a
  computed field that counts the number of offers for a given property
  type (use `offer_ids` to do so).

At this point, you have all the information necessary to know how many
offers are linked to a property type. When in doubt, add `offer_ids` and
`offer_count` directly to the view. The next step is to display the list
when clicking on the stat button.

- Create a stat button on `estate.property.type` pointing to the
  `estate.property.offer` action. This means you should use the
  `type="action"` attribute (go back to the end of
  `09_actions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} if you need a refresher).

At this point, clicking on the stat button should display all offers. We
still need to filter out the offers.

- On the `estate.property.offer` action, add a domain that defines
  `property_type_id` as equal to the `active_id` (= the current record,
  [here is an
  example](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/df37ce50e847e3489eb43d1ef6fc1bac6d6af333/addons/event/views/event_views.xml#L162))
:::

Looking good? If not, don\'t worry, the `next chapter
<12_inheritance>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} doesn\'t require stat
buttons ;-)

# Chapter 12: Inheritance

A powerful aspect of Odoo is its modularity. A module is dedicated to a
business need, but modules can also interact with one another. This is
useful for extending the functionality of an existing module. For
example, in our real estate scenario we want to display the list of a
salesperson\'s properties directly in the regular user view.

But before going through the specific Odoo module inheritance, let\'s
see how we can alter the behavior of the standard CRUD (Create,
Retrieve, Update or Delete) methods.

## Python Inheritance

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section:

- It should not be possible to delete a property which is not new or
  cancelled.

![Unlink](12_inheritance/unlink.gif){.align-center}

- When an offer is created, the property state should change to \'Offer
  Received\'
- It should not be possible to create an offer with a lower price than
  an existing offer

![Create](12_inheritance/create.gif){.align-center}
::::

In our real estate module, we never had to develop anything specific to
be able to do the standard CRUD actions. The Odoo framework provides the
necessary tools to do them. In fact, such actions are already included
in our model thanks to classical Python inheritance:

    from odoo import fields, models

    class TestModel(models.Model):
        _name = "test_model"
        _description = "Test Model"

        ...

Our `class TestModel` inherits from
`~odoo.models.Model`{.interpreted-text role="class"} which provides
`~odoo.models.Model.create`{.interpreted-text role="meth"},
`~odoo.models.Model.read`{.interpreted-text role="meth"},
`~odoo.models.Model.write`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} and
`~odoo.models.Model.unlink`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}.

These methods (and any other method defined on
`~odoo.models.Model`{.interpreted-text role="class"}) can be extended to
add specific business logic:

    from odoo import fields, models

    class TestModel(models.Model):
        _name = "test_model"
        _description = "Test Model"

        ...

        @api.model
        def create(self, vals_list):
            # Do some business logic, modify vals...
            ...
            # Then call super to execute the parent method
            return super().create(vals_list)

The decorator `~odoo.api.model`{.interpreted-text role="func"} is
necessary for the `~odoo.models.Model.create`{.interpreted-text
role="meth"} method because the content of the recordset `self` is not
relevant in the context of creation, but it is not necessary for the
other CRUD methods.

It is also important to note that even though we can directly override
the `~odoo.models.Model.unlink`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} method,
you will almost always want to write a new method with the decorator
`~odoo.api.ondelete`{.interpreted-text role="func"} instead. Methods
marked with this decorator will be called during
`~odoo.models.Model.unlink`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} and avoids
some issues that can occur during uninstalling the model\'s module when
`~odoo.models.Model.unlink`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} is directly
overridden.

In Python 3, `super()` is equivalent to `super(TestModel, self)`. The
latter may be necessary when you need to call the parent method with a
modified recordset.

:::: danger
::: title
Danger
:::

- It is very important to **always** call `super()` to avoid breaking
  the flow. There are only a few very specific cases where you don\'t
  want to call it.
- Make sure to **always** return data consistent with the parent method.
  For example, if the parent method returns a `dict()`, your override
  must also return a `dict()`.
::::

::: exercise
Add business logic to the CRUD methods.

- Prevent deletion of a property if its state is not \'New\' or
  \'Cancelled\'

Tip: create a new method with the `~odoo.api.ondelete`{.interpreted-text
role="func"} decorator and remember that `self` can be a recordset with
more than one record.

- At offer creation, set the property state to \'Offer Received\'. Also
  raise an error if the user tries to create an offer with a lower
  amount than an existing offer.

Tip: the `property_id` field is available in the `vals`, but it is an
`int`. To instantiate an `estate.property` object, use
`self.env[model_name].browse(value)`
([example](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/136e4f66cd5cafe7df450514937c7218c7216c93/addons/gamification/models/badge.py#L57))
:::

## Model Inheritance

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`reference/orm/inheritance`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

In our real estate module, we would like to display the list of
properties linked to a salesperson directly in the Settings / Users &
Companies / Users form view. To do this, we need to add a field to the
`res.users` model and adapt its view to show it.

Odoo provides two *inheritance* mechanisms to extend an existing model
in a modular way.

The first inheritance mechanism allows modules to modify the behavior of
a model defined in an another module by:

- adding fields to the model,
- overriding the definition of fields in the model,
- adding constraints to the model,
- adding methods to the model,
- overriding existing methods in the model.

The second inheritance mechanism (delegation) allows every record of a
model to be linked to a parent model\'s record and provides transparent
access to the fields of this parent record.

![Inheritance Methods](12_inheritance/inheritance_methods.png){.align-center}

In Odoo, the first mechanism is by far the most used. In our case, we
want to add a field to an existing model, which means we will use the
first mechanism. For example:

    from odoo import fields, models

    class InheritedModel(models.Model):
        _inherit = ["inherited.model"]

        new_field = fields.Char(string="New Field")

A practical example where two fields are added to a model can be found
[here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/60e9410e9aa3be4a9db50f6f7534ba31fea3bc29/addons/account_fleet/models/account_move.py#L39-L47).

By convention, each inherited model is defined in its own Python file.
In our example, it would be `models/inherited_model.py`.

::: exercise
Add a field to Users.

- Add the following field to `res.users`:

  Field          Type
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  property_ids   One2many inverse of the field that references the salesperson in `estate.property`

- Add a domain to the field so it only lists the available properties.
:::

In the next section let\'s add the field to the view and check that
everything is working well!

## View Inheritance

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`reference/view_records/inheritance`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section, the list of available properties
linked to a salesperson should be displayed in their user form view

![Users](12_inheritance/users.png){.align-center}
::::

Instead of modifying existing views in place (by overwriting them), Odoo
provides view inheritance where children \'extension\' views are applied
on top of root views. These extension can both add and remove content
from their parent view.

An extension view references its parent using the `inherit_id` field.
Instead of a single view, its `arch` field contains a number of `xpath`
elements that select and alter the content of their parent view:

``` xml
<record id="inherited_model_view_form" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">inherited.model.form.inherit.test</field>
    <field name="model">inherited.model</field>
    <field name="inherit_id" ref="inherited.inherited_model_view_form"/>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <!-- find field description and add the field
             new_field after it -->
        <xpath expr="//field[@name='description']" position="after">
          <field name="new_field"/>
        </xpath>
    </field>
</record>
```

`expr`

:   An [XPath](https://w3.org/TR/xpath) expression selecting a single
    element in the parent view. Raises an error if it matches no element
    or more than one

`position`

:   Operation to apply to the matched element:

    `inside`

    :   appends `xpath`\'s body to the end of the matched element

    `replace`

    :   replaces the matched element with the `xpath`\'s body, replacing
        any `$0` node occurrence in the new body with the original
        element

    `before`

    :   inserts the `xpath`\'s body as a sibling before the matched
        element

    `after`

    :   inserts the `xpaths`\'s body as a sibling after the matched
        element

    `attributes`

    :   alters the attributes of the matched element using the special
        `attribute` elements in the `xpath`\'s body

When matching a single element, the `position` attribute can be set
directly on the element to be found. Both inheritances below have the
same result.

``` xml
<xpath expr="//field[@name='description']" position="after">
    <field name="idea_ids" />
</xpath>

<field name="description" position="after">
    <field name="idea_ids" />
</field>
```

An example of a view inheritance extension can be found
[here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/691d1f087040f1ec7066e485d19ce3662dfc6501/addons/account_fleet/views/account_move_views.xml#L3-L17).

Inheritance is extensively used in Odoo due to its modular concept. Do
not hesitate to read the corresponding documentation for more info!

In the `next chapter <13_other_module>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"},
we will learn how to interact with other modules.




--- SOURCE: developer/tutorials/server_framework_101/13_other_module.md ---

# Chapter 13: Interact With Other Modules

In the `previous chapter <12_inheritance>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, we used inheritance to modify the behavior of a module. In
our real estate scenario, we would like to go a step further and be able
to generate invoices for our customers. Odoo provides an Invoicing
module, so it would be neat to create an invoice directly from our real
estate module, i.e. once a property is set to \'Sold\', an invoice is
created in the Invoicing application.

## Concrete Example: Account Move

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section:

- A new module `estate_account` should be created
- When a property is sold, an invoice should be issued for the buyer

![Invoice creation](13_other_module/create_inv.gif){.align-center}
::::

Any time we interact with another module, we need to keep in mind the
modularity. If we intend to sell our application to real estate
agencies, some may want the invoicing feature but others may not want
it.

### Link Module

The common approach for such use cases is to create a \'link\' module.
In our case, the module would depend on `estate` and `account` and would
include the invoice creation logic of the estate property. This way the
real estate and the accounting modules can be installed independently.
When both are installed, the link module provides the new feature.

::: exercise
Create a link module.

Create the `estate_account` module, which depends on the `estate` and
`account` modules. For now, it will be an empty shell.

Tip: you already did this at the
`beginning of the tutorial <02_newapp>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
The process is very similar.
:::

When the `estate_account` module appears in the list, go ahead and
install it! You\'ll notice that the Invoicing application is installed
as well. This is expected since your module depends on it. If you
uninstall the Invoicing application, your module will be uninstalled as
well.

### Invoice Creation {#tutorials/server_framework_101/13_other_module/create}

It\'s now time to generate the invoice. We want to add functionality to
the `estate.property` model, i.e. we want to add some extra logic for
when a property is sold. Does that sound familiar? If not, it\'s a good
idea to go back to the
`previous chapter <12_inheritance>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} since
you might have missed something ;-)

As a first step, we need to extend the action called when pressing the
`'Sold' button <09_actions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} on a
property. To do so, we need to create a
`model inheritance <12_inheritance>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} in
the [estate_account]{.title-ref} module for the `estate.property` model.
For now, the overridden action will simply return the `super` call.
Maybe an example will make things clearer:

    from odoo import models

    class InheritedModel(models.Model):
        _inherit = ["inherited.model"]

        def inherited_action(self):
            return super().inherited_action()

A practical example can be found
[here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/f1f48cdaab3dd7847e8546ad9887f24a9e2ed4c1/addons/event_sale/models/account_move.py#L7-L16).

::: exercise
Add the first step of invoice creation.

- Create a `estate_property.py` file in the correct folder of the
  `estate_account` module.
- `_inherit` the `estate.property` model.
- Override the `action_sold` method (you might have named it
  differently) to return the `super` call.

Tip: to make sure it works, add a `print` or a debugger breakpoint in
the overridden method.
:::

Is it working? If not, maybe check that all Python files are correctly
imported.

If the override is working, we can move forward and create the invoice.
Unfortunately, there is no easy way to know how to create any given
object in Odoo. Most of the time, it is necessary to have a look at its
model to find the required fields and provide appropriate values.

A good way to learn is to look at how other modules already do what you
want to do. For example, one of the basic flows of Sales is the creation
of an invoice from a sales order. This looks like a good starting point
since it does exactly what we want to do. Take some time to read and
understand the
[\_create_invoices](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/f1f48cdaab3dd7847e8546ad9887f24a9e2ed4c1/addons/sale/models/sale.py#L610-L717)
method. When you are done crying because this simple task looks awfully
complex, we can move forward in the tutorial.

To create an invoice, we need the following information:

- a `partner_id`: the customer
- a `move_type`: it has several [possible
  values](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/f1f48cdaab3dd7847e8546ad9887f24a9e2ed4c1/addons/account/models/account_move.py#L138-L147)
- a `journal_id`: the accounting journal

This is enough to create an empty invoice.

::: exercise
Add the second step of invoice creation.

Create an empty `account.move` in the override of the `action_sold`
method:

- the `partner_id` is taken from the current `estate.property`
- the `move_type` should correspond to a \'Customer Invoice\'

Tips:

- to create an object, use `self.env[model_name].create(values)`, where
  `values` is a `dict`.
- the `create` method doesn\'t accept recordsets as field values.
:::

When a property is set to \'Sold\', you should now have a new customer
invoice created in Invoicing / Customers / Invoices.

Obviously we don\'t have any invoice lines so far. To create an invoice
line, we need the following information:

- `name`: a description of the line
- `quantity`
- `price_unit`

Moreover, an invoice line needs to be linked to an invoice. The easiest
and most efficient way to link a line to an invoice is to include all
lines at invoice creation. To do this, the `invoice_line_ids` field is
included in the `account.move` creation, which is a
`~odoo.fields.One2many`{.interpreted-text role="class"}. One2many and
Many2many use special \'commands\' which have been made human readable
with the `~odoo.fields.Command`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
namespace. This namespace represents a triplet command to execute on a
set of records. The triplet was originally the only option to do these
commands, but it is now standard to use the namespace instead. The
format is to place them in a list which is executed sequentially. Here
is a simple example to include a One2many field `line_ids` at creation
of a `test_model`:

    from odoo import Command

    def inherited_action(self):
        self.env["test_model"].create(
            {
                "name": "Test",
                "line_ids": [
                    Command.create({
                        "field_1": "value_1",
                        "field_2": "value_2",
                    })
                ],
            }
        )
        return super().inherited_action()

::: exercise
Add the third step of invoice creation.

Add two invoice lines during the creation of the `account.move`. Each
property sold will be invoiced following these conditions:

- 6% of the selling price
- an additional 100.00 from administrative fees

Tip: Add the `invoice_line_ids` at creation following the example above.
For each line, we need a `name`, `quantity` and `price_unit`.
:::

This chapter might be one of the most difficult that has been covered so
far, but it is the closest to what Odoo development will be in practice.
In the `next chapter
<14_qwebintro>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, we will introduce the
templating mechanism used in Odoo.




--- SOURCE: developer/tutorials/server_framework_101/14_qwebintro.md ---

# Chapter 14: A Brief History Of QWeb

So far the interface design of our real estate module has been rather
limited. Building a list view is straightforward since only the list of
fields is necessary. The same holds true for the form view: despite the
use of a few tags such as `<group>` or `<page>`, there is very little to
do in terms of design.

However, if we want to give a unique look to our application, it is
necessary to go a step further and be able to design new views.
Moreover, other features such as PDF reports or website pages need
another tool to be created with more flexibility: a
[templating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor) engine.

You might already be familiar with existing engines such as Jinja
(Python), ERB (Ruby) or Twig (PHP). Odoo comes with its own built-in
engine: `reference/qweb`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. QWeb is the
primary templating engine used by Odoo. It is an XML templating engine
and used mostly to generate HTML fragments and pages.

You probably already have come across the [kanban
board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) in Odoo where the
records are displayed in a card-like structure. We will build such a
view for our real estate module.

## Concrete Example: A Kanban View

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`reference/view_architectures/kanban`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Goal**: at the end of this section a Kanban view of the properties
should be created:

![Kanban view](14_qwebintro/kanban.png){.align-center}
::::

In our estate application, we would like to add a Kanban view to display
our properties. Kanban views are a standard Odoo view (like the form and
list views), but their structure is much more flexible. In fact, the
structure of each card is a mix of form elements (including basic HTML)
and QWeb. The definition of a Kanban view is similar to the definition
of the list and form views, except that their root element is
`<kanban>`. In its simplest form, a Kanban view looks like:

``` xml
<kanban>
    <templates>
        <t t-name="kanban-card">
            <div>
                <field name="name"/>
            </div>
        </t>
    </templates>
</kanban>
```

Let\'s break down this example:

- `<templates>`: defines a list of `reference/qweb`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} templates. Kanban views *must* define at least one root
  template `kanban-card`, which will be rendered once for each record.
- `<t t-name="kanban-card">`: `<t>` is a placeholder element for QWeb
  directives. In this case, it is used to set the `name` of the template
  to `kanban-card`
- `<field name="name"/>`: this will add the `name` field to the view.

::: exercise
Make a minimal kanban view.

Using the simple example provided, create a minimal Kanban view for the
properties. The only field to display is the `name`.

Tip: you must add `kanban` in the `view_mode` of the corresponding
`ir.actions.act_window`.
:::

Once the Kanban view is working, we can start improving it. If we want
to display an element conditionally, we can use the `t-if` directive
(see `reference/qweb/conditionals`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).

``` xml
<kanban>
    <field name="state"/>
    <templates>
        <t t-name="kanban-card">
            <div>
                <field name="name"/>
                <div t-if="record.state.raw_value == 'new'">
                    This is new!
                </div>
            </div>
        </t>
    </templates>
</kanban>
```

We added a few things:

- `t-if`: the `<div>` element is rendered if the condition is true.
- `record`: an object with all the requested fields as its attributes.
  Each field has two attributes `value` and `raw_value`. The former is
  formatted according to current user parameters and the latter is the
  direct value from a `~odoo.models.Model.read`{.interpreted-text
  role="meth"}.

In the above example, the field `name` was added in the `<templates>`
element, but `state` is outside of it. When we need the value of a field
but don\'t want to display it in the view, it is possible to add it
outside of the `<templates>` element.

::: exercise
Improve the Kanban view.

Add the following fields to the Kanban view: expected price, best price,
selling price and tags. Pay attention: the best price is only displayed
when an offer is received, while the selling price is only displayed
when an offer is accepted.

Refer to the **Goal** of the section for a visual example.
:::

Let\'s give the final touch to our view: the properties must be grouped
by type by default. You might want to have a look at the various options
described in `reference/view_architectures/kanban`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

::: exercise
Add default grouping.

Use the appropriate attribute to group the properties by type by
default. You must also prevent drag and drop.

Refer to the **Goal** of the section for a visual example.
:::

Kanban views are a typical example of how it is always a good idea to
start from an existing view and fine tune it instead of starting from
scratch. There are many options and classes available, so\... read and
learn!

## Coding guidelines

We will start refactoring the code to match to the Odoo coding
guidelines. The guidelines aim to improve the quality of the Odoo Apps
code.

**Reference**: you will find the Odoo coding guidelines in
`/contributing/development/coding_guidelines`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

::: exercise
Polish your code.

Refactor your code to respect the coding guidelines. Don\'t forget to
run your linter and respect the module structure, the variable names,
the method name convention, the model attribute order and the xml ids.

## Test on the runbot

Odoo has its own `CI (Continuous integration)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} server named [runbot](https://runbot.odoo.com/). All
commits, branches and PR will be tested to avoid regressions or breaking
of the stable versions. All the runs that pass the tests are deployed on
their own server with demo data.

Welcome to the Server framework 101 tutorial! If you reached this page
that means you are interested in the development of your own Odoo
module. It might also mean that you recently joined the Odoo company for
a rather technical position. In any case, your journey to the technical
side of Odoo starts here.

The goal of this tutorial is for you to get an insight of the most
important parts of the Odoo development framework while developing your
own Odoo module to manage real estate assets. The chapters should be
followed in their given order since they cover the development of a new
Odoo application from scratch in an incremental way. In other words,
each chapter depends on the previous one.

# Setup guide

Depending on the intended use case, there are multiple ways to install
Odoo. For developers of the Odoo community and Odoo employees alike, the
preferred way is to perform a source install
(`running Odoo from the source code`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}).

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Follow the `contributing/development/setup`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} section of the contributing guide to prepare your
environment for pushing local changes to the Odoo repositories.
::::

## Adapt the environment for the tutorials

By now, you should have downloaded the source code into two local
repositories, one for [odoo/odoo]{.title-ref} and one for
[odoo/enterprise]{.title-ref}. These repositories are set up to push
changes to pre-defined forks on GitHub. This will prove to be convenient
when you start contributing to the codebase, but in the scope of
following a tutorial, we want to avoid polluting them with training
material. Let\'s then push your changes in a third repository:
[odoo/tutorials]{.title-ref}. Like the first two repositories, it will
be part of the [addons-path]{.title-ref} that references all directories
containing Odoo modules.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Depending on the tutorial that you are following, you might not need to
install all the modules that this repository contains.
::::

1.  Following the same process as with the [odoo/odoo]{.title-ref} and
    [odoo/enterprise]{.title-ref} repositories, clone the
    [odoo/tutorials]{.title-ref} repository on your machine with:

    ``` console
    $ git clone git@github.com:odoo/tutorials.git
    ```

2.  Configure your fork and Git to push changes to your fork rather than
    to the main codebase. If you work at Odoo, configure Git to push
    changes to the shared fork created on the account **odoo-dev**.

    ::::: tabs
    ::: tab
    Link Git with your fork

    1.  Visit
        [github.com/odoo/tutorials](https://github.com/odoo/tutorials)
        and click the `Fork`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
        to create a fork of the repository on your account.

    2.  In the command below, replace
        [\<your_github_account\>]{.title-ref} with the name of the
        GitHub account on which you created the fork.

        ``` console
        $ cd /TutorialsPath
        $ git remote add dev git@github.com:<your_github_account>/tutorials.git
        ```
    :::

    ::: tab
    Link Git with odoo-dev

    ``` console
    $ cd /tutorials
    $ git remote add dev git@github.com:odoo-dev/tutorials.git
    $ git remote set-url --push origin you_should_not_push_on_this_repository
    ```
    :::
    :::::

That\'s it! Your environment is now prepared to run Odoo from the
sources, and you have successfully created a repository to serve as an
addons directory. This will allow you to push your work to GitHub.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

**For Odoo employees only:**

1.  Make sure to read very carefully
    `contributing/development/first-contribution`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}. In particular, your branch name must follow our
    conventions.

2.  Once you have pushed your first change to the shared fork on
    **odoo-dev**, create a `PR (Pull Request)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"}. Please put your quadrigram in the PR title (e.g.,
    \"abcd - Technical Training\").

    This will enable you to share your upcoming work and receive
    feedback from your coaches. To ensure a continuous feedback loop, we
    recommend pushing a new commit as soon as you complete a chapter of
    the tutorial. Note that the PR is automatically updated with commits
    you push to **odoo-dev**, you don\'t need to open multiple PRs.

3.  At Odoo we use [Runbot](https://runbot.odoo.com) extensively for our
    `CI (Continuous
    Integration)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} tests. When you push
    your changes to **odoo-dev**, Runbot creates a new build and test
    your code. Once logged in, you will be able to see your branches
    [Tutorials project](https://runbot.odoo.com/runbot/tutorials-12).
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The specific location of the repositories on your file system is not
crucial. However, for the sake of simplicity, we will assume that you
have cloned all the repositories under the same directory. If this is
not the case, make sure to adjust the following commands accordingly,
providing the appropriate relative path from the [odoo/odoo]{.title-ref}
repository to the [odoo/tutorials]{.title-ref} repository.
::::

## Run the server

### Launch with [odoo-bin]{.title-ref}

Once all dependencies are set up, Odoo can be launched by running
[odoo-bin]{.title-ref}, the command-line interface of the server.

``` console
$ cd $HOME/src/odoo/
$ ./odoo-bin --addons-path="addons/,../enterprise/,../tutorials" -d rd-demo
```

There are multiple
`command-line arguments <reference/cmdline/server>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} that you can use to run the server. In this training you
will only need some of them.

::: option

`-d <database>`

:   

The database that is going to be used.
:::

::: option

`--addons-path <directories>`

:   

A comma-separated list of directories in which modules are stored. These
directories are scanned for modules.
:::

::: option

`--limit-time-cpu <limit>`

:   

Prevent the worker from using more than \<limit\> CPU seconds for each
request.
:::

::: option

`--limit-time-real <limit>`

:   

Prevent the worker from taking longer than \<limit\> seconds to process
a request.
:::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- The `--limit-time-cpu`{.interpreted-text role="option"} and
`--limit-time-real`{.interpreted-text role="option"} arguments can be
used to prevent the worker from being killed when debugging the source
code. - \| You may face an error similar to [AttributeError: module
\'\<MODULE_NAME\>\' has no attribute \'\<\$ATTRIBUTE\'\>]{.title-ref}.
In this case, you may need to re-install the module with `$ pip
install --upgrade --force-reinstall <MODULE_NAME>`{.interpreted-text
role="command"}. \| If this error occurs with more than one module, you
may need to re-install all the requirements with
`$ pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt`{.interpreted-text
role="command"}. \| You can also clear the python cache to solve the
issue:

``` console
$ cd $HOME/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/
$ find -name '*.pyc' -type f -delete
```

- Other commonly used arguments are:

\- `-i <odoo-bin --init>`{.interpreted-text role="option"}: Install some
modules before running the server (comma-separated list). This is
equivalent to going to `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
user interface, and installing the module from there. -
`-u <odoo-bin --update>`{.interpreted-text role="option"}: Update some
modules before running the server (comma-separated list). This is
equivalent to going to `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
user interface, selecting a module, and upgrading it from there.
::::

### Log in to Odoo

Open <http://localhost:8069/> on your browser. We recommend using
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/),
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/), or any other browser
with development tools.

To log in as the administrator user, use the following credentials:

- email: [admin]{.title-ref}
- password: [admin]{.title-ref}

## Enable the developer mode

The developer or debug mode is useful for training as it gives access to
additional (advanced) tools.
`Enable the developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} now. Choose the method that you prefer; they are all
equivalent.

## Extra tools

### Useful Git commands

Here are some useful Git commands for your day-to-day work.

- | Switch branches:
  | When you switch branches, both repositories (odoo and enterprise)
    must be synchronized, i.e. both need to be in the same branch.

  ``` console
  $ cd $HOME/src/odoo
  $ git switch {BRANCH}

  $ cd $HOME/src/enterprise
  $ git switch {BRANCH}
  ```

- Fetch and rebase:

  ``` console
  $ cd $HOME/src/odoo
  $ git fetch --all --prune
  $ git rebase --autostash odoo/{BRANCH}

  $ cd $HOME/src/enterprise
  $ git fetch --all --prune
  $ git rebase --autostash enterprise/{BRANCH}
  ```

### Code Editor

If you are working at Odoo, many of your colleagues are using
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com),
[VSCodium](https://vscodium.com) (the open source equivalent),
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=linux), or
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com). However, you are free to
choose your preferred editor.

It is important to configure your linters correctly. Using a linter
helps you by showing syntax and semantic warnings or errors. Odoo source
code tries to respect Python\'s and JavaScript\'s standards, but some of
them can be ignored.

For Python, we use PEP8 with these options ignored:

- \`E501\`: line too long
- \`E301\`: expected 1 blank line, found 0
- \`E302\`: expected 2 blank lines, found 1

For JavaScript, we use ESLint and you can find a [configuration file
example
here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/wiki/Javascript-coding-guidelines#use-a-linter).

### Administrator tools for PostgreSQL

You can manage your PostgreSQL databases using the command line as
demonstrated earlier or using a GUI application such as
[pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-apt/) or
[DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/).

To connect the GUI application to your database we recommend you connect
using the Unix socket.

- Host name/address: [/var/run/postgresql]{.title-ref}
- Port: [5432]{.title-ref}
- Username: [\$USER]{.title-ref}

### Python Debugging

When facing a bug or trying to understand how the code works, simply
printing things out can go a long way, but a proper debugger can save a
lot of time.

You can use a classic Python library debugger
([pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html),
[pudb](https://pypi.org/project/pudb/) or
[ipdb](https://pypi.org/project/ipdb/)), or you can use your editor\'s
debugger.

In the following example we use ipdb, but the process is similar with
other libraries.

1.  Install the library:

    ``` console
    pip install ipdb
    ```

2.  Place a trigger (breakpoint):

    ``` python
    import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()
    ```

    ::: example
    ``` {.python emphasize-lines="2"}
    def copy(self, default=None):
        import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()
        self.ensure_one()
        chosen_name = default.get('name') if default else ''
        new_name = chosen_name or _('%s (copy)') % self.name
        default = dict(default or {}, name=new_name)
        return super(Partner, self).copy(default)
    ```
    :::

Here is a list of commands:

::: option
h(elp) \[command\]

Print the list of available commands if not argument is supplied. With a
command as an argument, print the help about that command.
:::

::: option
pp expression

The value of the [expression]{.title-ref} is pretty-printed using the
[pprint]{.title-ref} module.
:::

::: option
w(here)

Print a stack trace with the most recent frame at the bottom.
:::

::: option
d(own)

Move the current frame one level down in the stack trace (to a newer
frame).
:::

::: option
u(p)

Move the current frame one level up in the stack trace (to an older
frame).
:::

::: option
n(ext)

Continue the execution until the next line in the current function is
reached or it returns.
:::

::: option
c(ontinue)

Continue the execution and only stop when a breakpoint is encountered.
:::

::: option
s(tep)

Execute the current line. Stop at the first possible occasion (either in
a function that is called or on the next line in the current function).
:::

::: option
q(uit)

Quit the debugger. The program being executed is aborted.

**Reference**: [Odoo\'s Test Framework: Learn Best
Practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEIscps0OOQ) (Odoo Experience

Writing tests is a necessity for multiple reasons. Here is a
non-exhaustive list:

- Ensure code will not be broken in the future
- Define the scope of your code
- Give examples of use cases
- It is one way to technically document the code
- Help your coding by defining your goal before working towards it

## Running Tests

Before knowing how to write tests, we need to know how to run them.

## Integration Bots

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This section is only for Odoo employees and people that are contributing
to [github.com/odoo]{.title-ref}. We highly recommend having your own CI
otherwise.
::::

When a test is written, it is important to make sure it always passes
when modifications are applied to the source code. To automate this
task, we use a development practice called Continuous Integration (CI).
This is why we have some bots running all the tests at different
moments. Whether you are working at Odoo or not, if you are trying to
merge something inside [odoo/odoo]{.title-ref},
[odoo/enterprise]{.title-ref}, [odoo/upgrade]{.title-ref} or on odoo.sh,
you will have to go through the CI. If you are working on another
project, you should think of adding your own CI.

### Runbot

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
[Runbot FAQ](https://runbot.odoo.com/doc).

Most of the tests are run on [Runbot](https://runbot.odoo.com) every
time a commit is pushed on GitHub.

You can see the state of a commit/branch by filtering on the runbot
dashboard.

A **bundle** is created for each branch. A bundle consists of a
configuration and batches.

A **batch** is a set of builds, depending on the parameters of the
bundle. A batch is green (i.e. passes the tests) if all the builds are
green.

A **build** is when we launch a server. It can be divided in sub-builds.
Usually there are builds for the community version, the enterprise
version (only if there is an enterprise branch but you can force the
build), and the migration of the branch. A build is green if every
sub-build is green.

A **sub-build** only does some parts of what a full build does. It is
used to speed up the CI process. Generally it is used to split the post
install tests in 4 parallel instances. A sub-build is green if all the
tests are passing and there are no errors/warnings logged.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\* All tests are run regardless of the modifications done. Correcting a
typo in an error message or refactoring a whole module triggers the same
tests. All modules will be installed as well. This means something might
not work even if the Runbot is green, i.e. your changes depend on a
module that the module the changes are in doesn\'t depend on. \* The
localization modules (i.e. country-specific modules) are not installed
on Runbot (except the generic one). Some modules with external
dependencies can also be excluded. \* There is a nightly build running
additional tests: module operations, localization, single module
installs, multi-builds for nondeterministic bugs, etc. These are not
kept in the standard CI to shorten the time of execution.
::::

You can also login to a build built by Runbot. There are 3 users usable:
[admin]{.title-ref}, [demo]{.title-ref} and [portal]{.title-ref}. The
password is the same as the login. This is useful to quickly test things
on different versions without having to build it locally. The full logs
are also available; these are used for monitoring.

### Robodoo

You will most likely have to gain a little bit more experience before
having the rights to summon robodoo, but here are a few remarks anyways.

Robodoo is the guy spamming the CI status as tags on your PRs, but he is
also the guy that kindly integrates your commits into the main
repositories.

When the last batch is green, the reviewer can ask robodoo to merge your
PR (it is more a [rebase]{.title-ref} than a [merge]{.title-ref}). It
will then go to the mergebot.

### Mergebot

[Mergebot](https://mergebot.odoo.com) is the last testing phase before
merging a PR.

It will take the commits in your branch not yet present on the target,
stage it and rerun the tests one more time, including the enterprise
version even if you are only changing something in community.

This step can fail with a [Staging failed]{.title-ref} error message.
This could be due to

- a nondeterministic bug that is already on the target. If you are an
  Odoo employee, you can check those here:
  <https://runbot.odoo.com/runbot/errors>
- a nondeterministic bug that you introduced but wasn\'t detected in the
  CI before
- an incompatibility with another commit merged right before and what
  you are trying to merge
- an incompatibility with the enterprise repository if you only did
  changes in the community repo

Always check that the issue does not come from you before asking the
merge bot to retry: rebase your branch on the target and rerun the tests
locally.

## Modules

Because Odoo is modular, the tests need to be also modular. This means
tests are defined in the module that adds the functionality you are
adding in, and tests cannot depend on functionality coming from modules
your module doesn\'t depend on.

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`Special Tags<reference/testing/tags>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

``` python
from odoo.tests.common import TransactionCase
from odoo.tests import tagged

# The CI will run these tests after all the modules are installed,
# not right after installing the one defining it.
@tagged('post_install', '-at_install')  # add `post_install` and remove `at_install`
class PostInstallTestCase(TransactionCase):
    def test_01(self):
        ...

@tagged('at_install')  # this is the default
class AtInstallTestCase(TransactionCase):
    def test_01(self):
        ...
```

If the behavior you want to test can be changed by the installation of
another module, you need to ensure that the tag [at_install]{.title-ref}
is set; otherwise, you can use the tag [post_install]{.title-ref} to
speed up the CI and ensure it is not changed if it shouldn\'t.

## Writing a test

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
[Python unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) and
`Testing Odoo<reference/testing>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Here are a few things to take into consideration before writing a test

- The tests should be independent of the data currently in the database
  (including demo data)
- Tests should not impact the database by leaving/changing residual
  data. This is usually done by the test framework by doing a rollback.
  Therefore, you must never call `cr.commit` in a test (nor anywhere
  else in the business code).
- For a bug fix, the test should fail before applying the fix and pass
  after.
- Don\'t test something that is already tested elsewhere; you can trust
  the ORM. Most of the tests in business modules should only test the
  business flows.
- You shouldn\'t need to flush data into the database.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Remember that `onchange` only applies in the Form views, not by changing
the attributes in python. This also applies in the tests. If you want to
emulate a Form view, you can use `odoo.tests.Form`.
::::

The tests should be in a `tests` folder at the root of your module. Each
test file name should start with [test\_]{.title-ref} and be imported in
the `__init__.py` of the test folder. You shouldn\'t import the test
folder/module in the `__init__.py` of the module.

``` bash
estate
├── models
│   ├── *.py
│   └── __init__.py
├── tests
│   ├── test_*.py
│   └── __init__.py
├── __init__.py
└── __manifest__.py
```

All the tests should extend `odoo.tests.common.TransactionCase`. You
usually define a `setUpClass` and the tests. After writing the
[setUpClass]{.title-ref}, you have an [env]{.title-ref} available in the
class and can start interacting with the ORM.

These test classes are built on top of the `unittest` python module.

``` python
from odoo.tests.common import TransactionCase
from odoo.exceptions import UserError
from odoo.tests import tagged

# The CI will run these tests after all the modules are installed,
# not right after installing the one defining it.
@tagged('post_install', '-at_install')
class EstateTestCase(TransactionCase):

    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        # add env on cls and many other things
        super(EstateTestCase, cls).setUpClass()

        # create the data for each tests. By doing it in the setUpClass instead
        # of in a setUp or in each test case, we reduce the testing time and
        # the duplication of code.
        cls.properties = cls.env['estate.property'].create([...])

    def test_creation_area(self):
        """Test that the total_area is computed like it should."""
        self.properties.living_area = 20
        self.assertRecordValues(self.properties, [
           {'name': ..., 'total_area': ...},
           {'name': ..., 'total_area': ...},
        ])


    def test_action_sell(self):
        """Test that everything behaves like it should when selling a property."""
        self.properties.action_sold()
        self.assertRecordValues(self.properties, [
           {'name': ..., 'state': ...},
           {'name': ..., 'state': ...},
        ])

        with self.assertRaises(UserError):
            self.properties.forbidden_action_on_sold_property()
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

For better readability, split your tests into multiple files depending
on the scope of the tests. You can also have a Common class that most of
the tests should inherit from; this common class can define the whole
setup for the module. For instance, in
[account]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/account/tests/common.py).
::::

::: exercise
Update the code so no one can:

- Create an offer for a sold property
- Sell a property with no accepted offers on it

and create tests for both of these cases. Additionally check that
selling a property that can be sold is correctly marked as sold after
selling it.

This guide assumes knowledge of:

- Javascript basics and good practices
- [jQuery](http://jquery.org)
- [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org)

It also requires
`an installed Odoo </administration/on_premise>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, and [Git](http://git-scm.com).
::::

## A Simple Module

Let\'s start with a simple Odoo module holding basic web component
configuration and letting us test the web framework.

The example module is available online and can be downloaded using the
following command:

``` console
$ git clone http://github.com/odoo/petstore
```

This will create a `petstore` folder wherever you executed the command.
You then need to add that folder to Odoo\'s
`addons path <odoo-bin --addons-path>`{.interpreted-text role="option"},
create a new database and install the `oepetstore` module.

If you browse the `petstore` folder, you should see the following
content:

``` text
oepetstore
|-- images
|   |-- alligator.jpg
|   |-- ball.jpg
|   |-- crazy_circle.jpg
|   |-- fish.jpg
|   `-- mice.jpg
|-- __init__.py
|-- oepetstore.message_of_the_day.csv
|-- __manifest__.py
|-- petstore_data.xml
|-- petstore.py
|-- petstore.xml
`-- static
    `-- src
        |-- css
        |   `-- petstore.css
        |-- js
        |   `-- petstore.js
        `-- xml
            `-- petstore.xml
```

The module already holds various server customizations. We\'ll come back
to these later, for now let\'s focus on the web-related content, in the
`static` folder.

Files used in the \"web\" side of an Odoo module must be placed in a
`static` folder so they are available to a web browser, files outside
that folder can not be fetched by browsers. The `src/css`, `src/js` and
`src/xml` sub-folders are conventional and not strictly necessary.

`oepetstore/static/css/petstore.css`

:   Currently empty, will hold the
    [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) for pet store
    content

`oepetstore/static/xml/petstore.xml`

:   Mostly empty, will hold `reference/qweb`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} templates

`oepetstore/static/js/petstore.js`

:   The most important (and interesting) part, contains the logic of the
    application (or at least its web-browser side) as javascript. It
    should currently look like:

    ``` javascript
    odoo.oepetstore = function(instance, local) {
        var _t = instance.web._t,
            _lt = instance.web._lt;
        var QWeb = instance.web.qweb;

        local.HomePage = instance.Widget.extend({
            start: function() {
                console.log("pet store home page loaded");
            },
        });

        instance.web.client_actions.add(
            'petstore.homepage', 'instance.oepetstore.HomePage');
    }
    ```

Which only prints a small message in the browser\'s console.

The files in the `static` folder, need to be defined within the module
in order for them to be loaded correctly. Everything in `src/xml` is
defined in `__manifest__.py` while the contents of `src/css` and
`src/js` are defined in `petstore.xml`, or a similar file.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

All JavaScript files are concatenated and `minified`{.interpreted-text
role="term"} to improve application load time.

One of the drawback is debugging becomes more difficult as individual
files disappear and the code is made significantly less readable. It is
possible to disable this process by enabling the \"developer mode\": log
into your Odoo instance (user *admin* password *admin* by default) open
the user menu (in the top-right corner of the Odoo screen) and select
`About Odoo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} then `Activate
the developer mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:

![image](web/about_odoo.png){.align-center}

![image](web/devmode.png){.align-center}

This will reload the web client with optimizations disabled, making
development and debugging significantly more comfortable.

## Odoo JavaScript Module

Javascript doesn\'t have built-in modules. As a result variables defined
in different files are all mashed together and may conflict. This has
given rise to various module patterns used to build clean namespaces and
limit risks of naming conflicts.

The Odoo framework uses one such pattern to define modules within web
addons, in order to both namespace code and correctly order its loading.

`oepetstore/static/js/petstore.js` contains a module declaration:

``` javascript
odoo.oepetstore = function(instance, local) {
    local.xxx = ...;
}
```

In Odoo web, modules are declared as functions set on the global `odoo`
variable. The function\'s name must be the same as the addon (in this
case `oepetstore`) so the framework can find it, and automatically
initialize it.

When the web client loads your module it will call the root function and
provide two parameters:

- the first parameter is the current instance of the Odoo web client, it
  gives access to various capabilities defined by the Odoo
  (translations, network services) as well as objects defined by the
  core or by other modules.
- the second parameter is your own local namespace automatically created
  by the web client. Objects and variables which should be accessible
  from outside your module (either because the Odoo web client needs to
  call them or because others may want to customize them) should be set
  inside that namespace.

## Classes

Much as modules, and contrary to most object-oriented languages,
javascript does not build in *classes*[^1] although it provides roughly
equivalent (if lower-level and more verbose) mechanisms.

For simplicity and developer-friendliness Odoo web provides a class
system based on John Resig\'s [Simple JavaScript
Inheritance](http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/).

New classes are defined by calling the
`~odoo.web.Class.extend`{.interpreted-text role="func"} method of
`odoo.web.Class`{.interpreted-text role="class"}:

``` javascript
var MyClass = instance.web.Class.extend({
    say_hello: function() {
        console.log("hello");
    },
});
```

The `~odoo.web.Class.extend`{.interpreted-text role="func"} method takes
a dictionary describing the new class\'s content (methods and static
attributes). In this case, it will only have a `say_hello` method which
takes no parameters.

Classes are instantiated using the `new` operator:

``` javascript
var my_object = new MyClass();
my_object.say_hello();
// print "hello" in the console
```

And attributes of the instance can be accessed via `this`:

``` javascript
var MyClass = instance.web.Class.extend({
    say_hello: function() {
        console.log("hello", this.name);
    },
});

var my_object = new MyClass();
my_object.name = "Bob";
my_object.say_hello();
// print "hello Bob" in the console
```

Classes can provide an initializer to perform the initial setup of the
instance, by defining an `init()` method. The initializer receives the
parameters passed when using the `new` operator:

``` javascript
var MyClass = instance.web.Class.extend({
    init: function(name) {
        this.name = name;
    },
    say_hello: function() {
        console.log("hello", this.name);
    },
});

var my_object = new MyClass("Bob");
my_object.say_hello();
// print "hello Bob" in the console
```

It is also possible to create subclasses from existing (used-defined)
classes by calling `~odoo.web.Class.extend`{.interpreted-text
role="func"} on the parent class, as is done to subclass
`~odoo.web.Class`{.interpreted-text role="class"}:

``` javascript
var MySpanishClass = MyClass.extend({
    say_hello: function() {
        console.log("hola", this.name);
    },
});

var my_object = new MySpanishClass("Bob");
my_object.say_hello();
// print "hola Bob" in the console
```

When overriding a method using inheritance, you can use `this._super()`
to call the original method:

``` javascript
var MySpanishClass = MyClass.extend({
    say_hello: function() {
        this._super();
        console.log("translation in Spanish: hola", this.name);
    },
});

var my_object = new MySpanishClass("Bob");
my_object.say_hello();
// print "hello Bob \n translation in Spanish: hola Bob" in the console
```

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

`_super` is not a standard method, it is set on-the-fly to the next
method in the current inheritance chain, if any. It is only defined
during the *synchronous* part of a method call, for use in asynchronous
handlers (after network calls or in `setTimeout` callbacks) a reference
to its value should be retained, it should not be accessed via `this`:

``` javascript
// broken, will generate an error
say_hello: function () {
    setTimeout(function () {
        this._super();
    }.bind(this), 0);
}

// correct
say_hello: function () {
    // don't forget .bind()
    var _super = this._super.bind(this);
    setTimeout(function () {
        _super();
    }.bind(this), 0);
}
```

## Widgets Basics

The Odoo web client bundles [jQuery](http://jquery.org) for easy DOM
manipulation. It is useful and provides a better API than standard [W3C
DOM](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/)[^2], but insufficient to
structure complex applications leading to difficult maintenance.

Much like object-oriented desktop UI toolkits (e.g.
[Qt](http://qt-project.org),
[Cocoa](https://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/cocoa.html) or
[GTK](http://www.gtk.org)), Odoo Web makes specific components
responsible for sections of a page. In Odoo web, the base for such
components is the `~odoo.Widget`{.interpreted-text role="class"} class,
a component specialized in handling a page section and displaying
information for the user.

### Your First Widget

The initial demonstration module already provides a basic widget:

``` javascript
local.HomePage = instance.Widget.extend({
    start: function() {
        console.log("pet store home page loaded");
    },
});
```

It extends `~odoo.Widget`{.interpreted-text role="class"} and overrides
the standard method `~odoo.Widget.start`{.interpreted-text role="func"},
which --- much like the previous `MyClass` --- does little for now.

This line at the end of the file:

``` javascript
instance.web.client_actions.add(
    'petstore.homepage', 'instance.oepetstore.HomePage');
```

registers our basic widget as a client action. Client actions will be
explained later, for now this is just what allows our widget to be
called and displayed when we select the
`Pet Store --> Pet Store --> Home Page`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} menu.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

because the widget will be called from outside our module, the web
client needs its \"fully qualified\" name, not the local version.
::::

### Display Content

Widgets have a number of methods and features, but the basics are
simple:

- set up a widget
- format the widget\'s data
- display the widget

The `HomePage` widget already has a
`~odoo.Widget.start`{.interpreted-text role="func"} method. That method
is part of the normal widget lifecycle and automatically called once the
widget is inserted in the page. We can use it to display some content.

All widgets have a `~odoo.Widget.$el`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}
which represents the section of page they\'re in charge of (as a
[jQuery](http://jquery.org) object). Widget content should be inserted
there. By default, `~odoo.Widget.$el`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} is
an empty `<div>` element.

A `<div>` element is usually invisible to the user if it has no content
(or without specific styles giving it a size) which is why nothing is
displayed on the page when `HomePage` is launched.

Let\'s add some content to the widget\'s root element, using jQuery:

``` javascript
local.HomePage = instance.Widget.extend({
    start: function() {
        this.$el.append("<div>Hello dear Odoo user!</div>");
    },
});
```

That message will now appear when you open `Pet Store
--> Pet Store --> Home Page`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

to refresh the javascript code loaded in Odoo Web, you will need to
reload the page. There is no need to restart the Odoo server.
::::

The `HomePage` widget is used by Odoo Web and managed automatically. To
learn how to use a widget \"from scratch\" let\'s create a new one:

``` javascript
local.GreetingsWidget = instance.Widget.extend({
    start: function() {
        this.$el.append("<div>We are so happy to see you again in this menu!</div>");
    },
});
```

We can now add our `GreetingsWidget` to the `HomePage` by using the
`GreetingsWidget`\'s `~odoo.Widget.appendTo`{.interpreted-text
role="func"} method:

``` javascript
local.HomePage = instance.Widget.extend({
    start: function() {
        this.$el.append("<div>Hello dear Odoo user!</div>");
        var greeting = new local.GreetingsWidget(this);
        return greeting.appendTo(this.$el);
    },
});
```

- `HomePage` first adds its own content to its DOM root
- `HomePage` then instantiates `GreetingsWidget`
- Finally it tells `GreetingsWidget` where to insert itself, delegating
  part of its `~odoo.Widget.$el`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} to the
  `GreetingsWidget`.

When the `~odoo.Widget.appendTo`{.interpreted-text role="func"} method
is called, it asks the widget to insert itself at the specified position
and to display its content. The `~odoo.Widget.start`{.interpreted-text
role="func"} method will be called during the call to
`~odoo.Widget.appendTo`{.interpreted-text role="func"}.

To see what happens under the displayed interface, we will use the
browser\'s DOM Explorer. But first let\'s alter our widgets slightly so
we can more easily find where they are, by
`adding a class to their root elements
<odoo.Widget.className>`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}:

``` javascript
local.HomePage = instance.Widget.extend({
    className: 'oe_petstore_homepage',
    ...
});
local.GreetingsWidget = instance.Widget.extend({
    className: 'oe_petstore_greetings',
    ...
});
```

If you can find the relevant section of the DOM (right-click on the text
then `Inspect Element`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), it should
look like this:

``` html
<div class="oe_petstore_homepage">
    <div>Hello dear Odoo user!</div>
    <div class="oe_petstore_greetings">
        <div>We are so happy to see you again in this menu!</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

Which clearly shows the two `<div>` elements automatically created by
`~odoo.Widget`{.interpreted-text role="class"}, because we added some
classes on them.

We can also see the two message-holding divs we added ourselves

Finally, note the `<div class="oe_petstore_greetings">` element which
represents the `GreetingsWidget` instance is *inside* the
`<div class="oe_petstore_homepage">` which represents the `HomePage`
instance, since we appended

### Widget Parents and Children

In the previous part, we instantiated a widget using this syntax:

``` javascript
new local.GreetingsWidget(this);
```

The first argument is `this`, which in that case was a `HomePage`
instance. This tells the widget being created which other widget is its
*parent*.

As we\'ve seen, widgets are usually inserted in the DOM by another
widget and *inside* that other widget\'s root element. This means most
widgets are \"part\" of another widget, and exist on behalf of it. We
call the container the *parent*, and the contained widget the *child*.

Due to multiple technical and conceptual reasons, it is necessary for a
widget to know who is its parent and who are its children.

`~odoo.Widget.getParent`{.interpreted-text role="func"}

:   can be used to get the parent of a widget:

    ``` javascript
    local.GreetingsWidget = instance.Widget.extend({
        start: function() {
            console.log(this.getParent().$el );
            // will print "div.oe_petstore_homepage" in the console
        },
    });
    ```

`~odoo.Widget.getChildren`{.interpreted-text role="func"}

:   can be used to get a list of its children:

    ``` javascript
    local.HomePage = instance.Widget.extend({
        start: function() {
            var greeting = new local.GreetingsWidget(this);
            greeting.appendTo(this.$el);
            console.log(this.getChildren()[0].$el);
            // will print "div.oe_petstore_greetings" in the console
        },
    });
    ```

When overriding the `~odoo.Widget.init`{.interpreted-text role="func"}
method of a widget it is *of the utmost importance* to pass the parent
to the `this._super()` call, otherwise the relation will not be set up
correctly:

``` javascript
local.GreetingsWidget = instance.Widget.extend({
    init: function(parent, name) {
        this._super(parent);
        this.name = name;
    },
});
```

Finally, if a widget does not have a parent (e.g. because it\'s the root
widget of the application), `null` can be provided as parent:

``` javascript
new local.GreetingsWidget(null);
```

### Destroying Widgets

If you can display content to your users, you should also be able to
erase it. This is done via the `~odoo.Widget.destroy`{.interpreted-text
role="func"} method:

``` javascript
greeting.destroy();
```

When a widget is destroyed it will first call
`~odoo.Widget.destroy`{.interpreted-text role="func"} on all its
children. Then it erases itself from the DOM. If you have set up
permanent structures in `~odoo.Widget.init`{.interpreted-text
role="func"} or `~odoo.Widget.start`{.interpreted-text role="func"}
which must be explicitly cleaned up (because the garbage collector will
not handle them), you can override
`~odoo.Widget.destroy`{.interpreted-text role="func"}.

:::: danger
::: title
Danger

when overriding `~odoo.Widget.destroy`{.interpreted-text role="func"},
`_super()` *must always* be called otherwise the widget and its children

## The QWeb Template Engine

In the previous section we added content to our widgets by directly
manipulating (and adding to) their DOM:

``` javascript
this.$el.append("<div>Hello dear Odoo user!</div>");
```

This allows generating and displaying any type of content, but gets
unwieldy when generating significant amounts of DOM (lots of
duplication, quoting issues, \...)

As many other environments, Odoo\'s solution is to use a [template
engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system). Odoo\'s
template engine is called `reference/qweb`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

QWeb is an XML-based templating language, similar to
[Genshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genshi_(templating_language)),
[Thymeleaf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymeleaf) or
[Facelets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facelets). It has the following
characteristics:

- It\'s implemented fully in JavaScript and rendered in the browser
- Each template file (XML files) contains multiple templates
- It has special support in Odoo Web\'s `~odoo.Widget`{.interpreted-text
  role="class"}, though it can be used outside of Odoo\'s web client
  (and it\'s possible to use `~odoo.Widget`{.interpreted-text
  role="class"} without relying on QWeb)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The rationale behind using QWeb instead of existing javascript template
engines is the extensibility of pre-existing (third-party) templates,
much like Odoo
`views <../reference/user_interface/view_records>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

Most javascript template engines are text-based which precludes easy
structural extensibility where an XML-based templating engine can be
generically altered using e.g. XPath or CSS and a tree-alteration DSL
(or even just XSLT). This flexibility and extensibility is a core
characteristic of Odoo, and losing it was considered unacceptable.
::::

### Using QWeb

First let\'s define a simple QWeb template in the almost-empty
`oepetstore/static/src/xml/petstore.xml` file:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<templates xml:space="preserve">
    <t t-name="HomePageTemplate">
        <div style="background-color: red;">This is some simple HTML</div>
    </t>
</templates>
```

Now we can use this template inside of the `HomePage` widget. Using the
`QWeb` loader variable defined at the top of the page, we can call to
the template defined in the XML file:

``` javascript
local.HomePage = instance.Widget.extend({
    start: function() {
        this.$el.append(QWeb.render("HomePageTemplate"));
    },
});
```

`QWeb.render`{.interpreted-text role="func"} looks for the specified
template, renders it to a string and returns the result.

However, because `~odoo.Widget`{.interpreted-text role="class"} has
special integration for QWeb the template can be set directly on the
widget via its `~odoo.Widget.template`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}
attribute:

``` javascript
local.HomePage = instance.Widget.extend({
    template: "HomePageTemplate",
    start: function() {
        ...
    },
});
```

Although the result looks similar, there are two differences between
these usages:

- with the second version, the template is rendered right before
  `~odoo.Widget.start`{.interpreted-text role="func"} is called
- in the first version the template\'s content is added to the widget\'s
  root element, whereas in the second version the template\'s root
  element is directly *set as* the widget\'s root element. Which is why
  the \"greetings\" sub-widget also gets a red background

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

templates should have a single non-`t` root element, especially if
they\'re set as a widget\'s `~odoo.Widget.template`{.interpreted-text
role="attr"}. If there are multiple \"root elements\", results are
undefined (usually only the first root element will be used and the
others will be ignored)
::::

#### QWeb Context

QWeb templates can be given data and can contain basic display logic.

For explicit calls to `QWeb.render`{.interpreted-text role="func"}, the
template data is passed as second parameter:

``` javascript
QWeb.render("HomePageTemplate", {name: "Klaus"});
```

with the template modified to:

``` xml
<t t-name="HomePageTemplate">
    <div>Hello <t t-esc="name"/></div>
</t>
```

will result in:

``` html
<div>Hello Klaus</div>
```

When using `~odoo.Widget`{.interpreted-text role="class"}\'s integration
it is not possible to provide additional data to the template. The
template will be given a single `widget` context variable, referencing
the widget being rendered right before
`~odoo.Widget.start`{.interpreted-text role="func"} is called (the
widget\'s state will essentially be that set up by
`~odoo.Widget.init`{.interpreted-text role="func"}):

``` xml
<t t-name="HomePageTemplate">
    <div>Hello <t t-esc="widget.name"/></div>
</t>
```

``` javascript
local.HomePage = instance.Widget.extend({
    template: "HomePageTemplate",
    init: function(parent) {
        this._super(parent);
        this.name = "Mordecai";
    },
    start: function() {
    },
});
```

Result:

``` html
<div>Hello Mordecai</div>
```

#### Template Declaration

We\'ve seen how to *render* QWeb templates, let\'s now see the syntax of
the templates themselves.

A QWeb template is composed of regular XML mixed with QWeb *directives*.
A QWeb directive is declared with XML attributes starting with `t-`.

The most basic directive is `t-name`, used to declare new templates in a
template file:

``` xml
<templates>
    <t t-name="HomePageTemplate">
        <div>This is some simple HTML</div>
    </t>
</templates>
```

`t-name` takes the name of the template being defined, and declares that
it can be called using `QWeb.render`{.interpreted-text role="func"}. It
can only be used at the top-level of a template file.

#### Escaping

The `t-esc` directive can be used to output text:

``` xml
<div>Hello <t t-esc="name"/></div>
```

It takes a Javascript expression which is evaluated, the result of the
expression is then HTML-escaped and inserted in the document. Since
it\'s an expression it\'s possible to provide just a variable name as
above, or a more complex expression like a computation:

``` xml
<div><t t-esc="3+5"/></div>
```

or method calls:

``` xml
<div><t t-esc="name.toUpperCase()"/></div>
```

#### Outputting HTML

To inject HTML in the page being rendered, use `t-raw`. Like `t-esc` it
takes an arbitrary Javascript expression as parameter, but it does not
perform an HTML-escape step.

``` xml
<div><t t-raw="name.link(user_account)"/></div>
```

:::: danger
::: title
Danger
:::

`t-raw` *must not* be used on any data which may contain non-escaped
user-provided content as this leads to [cross-site
scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting)
vulnerabilities
::::

#### Conditionals

QWeb can have conditional blocks using `t-if`. The directive takes an
arbitrary expression, if the expression is falsy (`false`, `null`, `0`
or an empty string) the whole block is suppressed, otherwise it is
displayed.

``` xml
<div>
    <t t-if="true == true">
        true is true
    </t>
    <t t-if="true == false">
        true is not true
    </t>
</div>
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

QWeb doesn\'t have an \"else\" structure, use a second `t-if` with the
original condition inverted. You may want to store the condition in a
local variable if it\'s a complex or expensive expression.
::::

#### Iteration

To iterate on a list, use `t-foreach` and `t-as`. `t-foreach` takes an
expression returning a list to iterate on `t-as` takes a variable name
to bind to each item during iteration.

``` xml
<div>
    <t t-foreach="names" t-as="name">
        <div>
            Hello <t t-esc="name"/>
        </div>
    </t>
</div>
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`t-foreach` can also be used with numbers and objects (dictionaries)
::::

#### Defining attributes

QWeb provides two related directives to define computed attributes:
`t-att-{name}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"} and
`t-attf-{name}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}. In either case, *name*
is the name of the attribute to create (e.g. `t-att-id` defines the
attribute `id` after rendering).

`t-att-` takes a javascript expression whose result is set as the
attribute\'s value, it is most useful if all of the attribute\'s value
is computed:

``` xml
<div>
    Input your name:
    <input type="text" t-att-value="defaultName"/>
</div>
```

`t-attf-` takes a *format string*. A format string is literal text with
interpolation blocks inside, an interpolation block is a javascript
expression between `{{` and `}}`, which will be replaced by the result
of the expression. It is most useful for attributes which are partially
literal and partially computed such as a class:

``` xml
<div t-attf-class="container {{ left ? 'text-left' : '' }} {{ extra_class }}">
    insert content here
</div>
```

#### Calling other templates

Templates can be split into sub-templates (for simplicity,
maintainability, reusability or to avoid excessive markup nesting).

This is done using the `t-call` directive, which takes the name of the
template to render:

``` xml
<t t-name="A">
    <div class="i-am-a">
        <t t-call="B"/>
    </div>
</t>
<t t-name="B">
    <div class="i-am-b"/>
</t>
```

rendering the `A` template will result in:

``` xml
<div class="i-am-a">
    <div class="i-am-b"/>
</div>
```

Sub-templates inherit the rendering context of their caller.

Usage of QWeb in Widgets

Create a widget whose constructor takes two parameters aside from
`parent`: `product_names` and `color`.

- `product_names` should an array of strings, each one the name of a
  product
- `color` is a string containing a color in CSS color format (ie:
  `#000000` for black).

The widget should display the given product names one under the other,
each one in a separate box with a background color with the value of
`color` and a border. You should use QWeb to render the HTML. Any
necessary CSS should be in `oepetstore/static/src/css/petstore.css`.

Use the widget in `HomePage` with half a dozen products.

## Widget Helpers

### `Widget`\'s jQuery Selector

Selecting DOM elements within a widget can be performed by calling the
`find()` method on the widget\'s DOM root:

``` javascript
this.$el.find("input.my_input")...
```

But because it\'s a common operation, `~odoo.Widget`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} provides an equivalent shortcut through the
`~odoo.Widget.$`{.interpreted-text role="func"} method:

``` javascript
local.MyWidget = instance.Widget.extend({
    start: function() {
        this.$("input.my_input")...
    },
});
```

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

The global jQuery function `$()` should *never* be used unless it is
absolutely necessary: selection on a widget\'s root are scoped to the
widget and local to it, but selections with `$()` are global to the
page/application and may match parts of other widgets and views, leading
to odd or dangerous side-effects. Since a widget should generally act
only on the DOM section it owns, there is no cause for global selection.
::::

### Easier DOM Events Binding

We have previously bound DOM events using normal jQuery event handlers
(e.g. `.click()` or `.change()`) on widget elements:

``` javascript
local.MyWidget = instance.Widget.extend({
    start: function() {
        var self = this;
        this.$(".my_button").click(function() {
            self.button_clicked();
        });
    },
    button_clicked: function() {
        ..
    },
});
```

While this works it has a few issues:

1.  it is rather verbose
2.  it does not support replacing the widget\'s root element at runtime
    as the binding is only performed when `start()` is run (during
    widget initialization)
3.  it requires dealing with `this`-binding issues

Widgets thus provide a shortcut to DOM event binding via
`~odoo.Widget.events`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}:

``` javascript
local.MyWidget = instance.Widget.extend({
    events: {
        "click .my_button": "button_clicked",
    },
    button_clicked: function() {
        ..
    }
});
```

`~odoo.Widget.events`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} is an object
(mapping) of an event to the function or method to call when the event
is triggered:

- the key is an event name, possibly refined with a CSS selector in
  which case only if the event happens on a selected sub-element will
  the function or method run: `click` will handle all clicks within the
  widget, but `click .my_button` will only handle clicks in elements
  bearing the `my_button` class

- the value is the action to perform when the event is triggered

  It can be either a function:

  ``` javascript
  events: {
      'click': function (e) { /* code here */ }
  }
  ```

  or the name of a method on the object (see example above).

  In either case, the `this` is the widget instance and the handler is
  given a single parameter, the [jQuery event
  object](http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/) for the
  event.

## Widget Events and Properties

### Events

Widgets provide an event system (separate from the DOM/jQuery event
system described above): a widget can fire events on itself, and other
widgets (or itself) can bind themselves and listen for these events:

``` javascript
local.ConfirmWidget = instance.Widget.extend({
    events: {
        'click button.ok_button': function () {
            this.trigger('user_chose', true);
        },
        'click button.cancel_button': function () {
            this.trigger('user_chose', false);
        }
    },
    start: function() {
        this.$el.append("<div>Are you sure you want to perform this action?</div>" +
            "<button class='ok_button'>Ok</button>" +
            "<button class='cancel_button'>Cancel</button>");
    },
});
```

This widget acts as a facade, transforming user input (through DOM
events) into a documentable internal event to which parent widgets can
bind themselves.

`~odoo.Widget.trigger`{.interpreted-text role="func"} takes the name of
the event to trigger as its first (mandatory) argument, any further
arguments are treated as event data and passed directly to listeners.

We can then set up a parent event instantiating our generic widget and
listening to the `user_chose` event using
`~odoo.Widget.on`{.interpreted-text role="func"}:

``` javascript
local.HomePage = instance.Widget.extend({
    start: function() {
        var widget = new local.ConfirmWidget(this);
        widget.on("user_chose", this, this.user_chose);
        widget.appendTo(this.$el);
    },
    user_chose: function(confirm) {
        if (confirm) {
            console.log("The user agreed to continue");
        } else {
            console.log("The user refused to continue");
        }
    },
});
```

`~odoo.Widget.on`{.interpreted-text role="func"} binds a function to be
called when the event identified by `event_name` is. The `func` argument
is the function to call and `object` is the object to which that
function is related if it is a method. The bound function will be called
with the additional arguments of
`~odoo.Widget.trigger`{.interpreted-text role="func"} if it has any.
Example:

``` javascript
start: function() {
    var widget = ...
    widget.on("my_event", this, this.my_event_triggered);
    widget.trigger("my_event", 1, 2, 3);
},
my_event_triggered: function(a, b, c) {
    console.log(a, b, c);
    // will print "1 2 3"
}
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Triggering events on an other widget is generally a bad idea. The main
exception to that rule is `odoo.web.bus` which exists specifically to
broadcasts evens in which any widget could be interested throughout the
Odoo web application.
::::

### Properties

Properties are very similar to normal object attributes in that they
allow storing data on a widget instance, however they have the
additional feature that they trigger events when set:

``` javascript
start: function() {
    this.widget = ...
    this.widget.on("change:name", this, this.name_changed);
    this.widget.set("name", "Nicolas");
},
name_changed: function() {
    console.log("The new value of the property 'name' is", this.widget.get("name"));
}
```

- `~odoo.Widget.set`{.interpreted-text role="func"} sets the value of a
  property and triggers `change:{propname}`{.interpreted-text
  role="samp"} (where *propname* is the property name passed as first
  parameter to `~odoo.Widget.set`{.interpreted-text role="func"}) and
  `change`
- `~odoo.Widget.get`{.interpreted-text role="func"} retrieves the value
  of a property.

### Exercise

:::: exercise
Widget Properties and Events

Create a widget `ColorInputWidget` that will display 3
`<input type="text">`. Each of these `<input>` is dedicated to type a
hexadecimal number from 00 to FF. When any of these `<input>` is
modified by the user the widget must query the content of the three
`<input>`, concatenate their values to have a complete CSS color code
(ie: `#00FF00`) and put the result in a property named `color`. Please
note the jQuery `change()` event that you can bind on any HTML `<input>`
element and the `val()` method that can query the current value of that
`<input>` could be useful to you for this exercise.

Then, modify the `HomePage` widget to instantiate `ColorInputWidget` and
display it. The `HomePage` widget should also display an empty
rectangle. That rectangle must always, at any moment, have the same
background color as the color in the `color` property of the
`ColorInputWidget` instance.

## Modify existing widgets and classes

The class system of the Odoo web framework allows direct modification of
existing classes using the `~odoo.web.Class.include`{.interpreted-text
role="func"} method:

``` javascript
var TestClass = instance.web.Class.extend({
    testMethod: function() {
        return "hello";
    },
});

TestClass.include({
    testMethod: function() {
        return this._super() + " world";
    },
});

console.log(new TestClass().testMethod());
// will print "hello world"
```

This system is similar to the inheritance mechanism, except it will
alter the target class in-place instead of creating a new class.

In that case, `this._super()` will call the original implementation of a
method being replaced/redefined. If the class already had sub-classes,
all calls to `this._super()` in sub-classes will call the new
implementations defined in the call to
`~odoo.web.Class.include`{.interpreted-text role="func"}. This will also
work if some instances of the class (or of any of its sub-classes) were
created prior to the call to `~odoo.Widget.include`{.interpreted-text
role="func"}.

## Translations

The process to translate text in Python and JavaScript code is very
similar. You could have noticed these lines at the beginning of the
`petstore.js` file:

``` javascript
var _t = instance.web._t,
    _lt = instance.web._lt;
```

These lines are simply used to import the translation functions in the
current JavaScript module. They are used thus:

``` javascript
this.$el.text(_t("Hello user!"));
```

In Odoo, translations files are automatically generated by scanning the
source code. All piece of code that calls a certain function are
detected and their content is added to a translation file that will then
be sent to the translators. In Python, the function is `_()`. In
JavaScript the function is `~odoo.web._t`{.interpreted-text role="func"}
(and also `~odoo.web._lt`{.interpreted-text role="func"}).

`_t()` will return the translation defined for the text it is given. If
no translation is defined for that text, it will return the original
text as-is.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To inject user-provided values in translatable strings, it is
recommended to use
[\_.str.sprintf](http://gabceb.github.io/underscore.string.site/#sprintf)
with named arguments *after* the translation:

``` javascript
this.$el.text(_.str.sprintf(
    _t("Hello, %(user)s!"), {
    user: "Ed"
}));
```

This makes translatable strings more readable to translators, and gives
them more flexibility to reorder or ignore parameters.
::::

`~odoo.web._lt`{.interpreted-text role="func"} (\"lazy translate\") is
similar but somewhat more complex: instead of translating its parameter
immediately, it returns an object which, when converted to a string,
will perform the translation.

It is used to define translatable terms before the translations system
is initialized, for class attributes for instance (as modules are loaded
before the user\'s language is configured and translations are
downloaded).

## Communication with the Odoo Server

### Contacting Models

Most operations with Odoo involve communicating with *models*
implementing business concern, these models will then (potentially)
interact with some storage engine (usually
[PostgreSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL)).

Although [jQuery](http://jquery.org) provides a
[\$.ajax](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) function for network
interactions, communicating with Odoo requires additional metadata whose
setup before every call would be verbose and error-prone. As a result,
Odoo web provides higher-level communication primitives.

To demonstrate this, the file `petstore.py` already contains a small
model with a sample method:

``` python
class message_of_the_day(models.Model):
    _name = "oepetstore.message_of_the_day"

    @api.model
    def my_method(self):
        return {"hello": "world"}

    message = fields.Text(),
    color = fields.Char(size=20),
```

This declares a model with two fields, and a method `my_method()` which
returns a literal dictionary.

Here is a sample widget that calls `my_method()` and displays the
result:

``` javascript
local.HomePage = instance.Widget.extend({
    start: function() {
        var self = this;
        var model = new instance.web.Model("oepetstore.message_of_the_day");
        model.call("my_method", {context: new instance.web.CompoundContext()}).then(function(result) {
            self.$el.append("<div>Hello " + result["hello"] + "</div>");
            // will show "Hello world" to the user
        });
    },
});
```

The class used to call Odoo models is `odoo.Model`{.interpreted-text
role="class"}. It is instantiated with the Odoo model\'s name as first
parameter (`oepetstore.message_of_the_day` here).

`~odoo.web.Model.call`{.interpreted-text role="func"} can be used to
call any (public) method of an Odoo model. It takes the following
positional arguments:

`name`

:   The name of the method to call, `my_method` here

`args`

:   an array of [positional
    arguments](https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-argument) to
    provide to the method. Because the example has no positional
    argument to provide, the `args` parameter is not provided.

    Here is an other example with positional arguments:

    ``` python
    @api.model
    def my_method2(self, a, b, c): ...
    ```

    ``` javascript
    model.call("my_method", [1, 2, 3], ...
    // with this a=1, b=2 and c=3
    ```

`kwargs`

:   a mapping of [keyword
    arguments](https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-argument) to
    pass. The example provides a single named argument `context`.

    ``` python
    @api.model
    def my_method2(self, a, b, c): ...
    ```

    ``` javascript
    model.call("my_method", [], {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, ...
    // with this a=1, b=2 and c=3
    ```

`~odoo.Widget.call`{.interpreted-text role="func"} returns a deferred
resolved with the value returned by the model\'s method as first
argument.

### CompoundContext

The previous section used a `context` argument which was not explained
in the method call:

``` javascript
model.call("my_method", {context: new instance.web.CompoundContext()})
```

The context is like a \"magic\" argument that the web client will always
give to the server when calling a method. The context is a dictionary
containing multiple keys. One of the most important key is the language
of the user, used by the server to translate all the messages of the
application. Another one is the time zone of the user, used to compute
correctly dates and times if Odoo is used by people in different
countries.

The `argument` is necessary in all methods, otherwise bad things could
happen (such as the application not being translated correctly). That\'s
why, when you call a model\'s method, you should always provide that
argument. The solution to achieve that is to use
`odoo.web.CompoundContext`{.interpreted-text role="class"}.

`~odoo.web.CompoundContext`{.interpreted-text role="class"} is a class
used to pass the user\'s context (with language, time zone, etc\...) to
the server as well as adding new keys to the context (some models\'
methods use arbitrary keys added to the context). It is created by
giving to its constructor any number of dictionaries or other
`~odoo.web.CompoundContext`{.interpreted-text role="class"} instances.
It will merge all those contexts before sending them to the server.

``` javascript
model.call("my_method", {context: new instance.web.CompoundContext({'new_key': 'key_value'})})
```

``` python
@api.model
def my_method(self):
    print(self.env.context)
    // will print: {'lang': 'en_US', 'new_key': 'key_value', 'tz': 'Europe/Brussels', 'uid': 1}
```

You can see the dictionary in the argument `context` contains some keys
that are related to the configuration of the current user in Odoo plus
the `new_key` key that was added when instantiating
`~odoo.web.CompoundContext`{.interpreted-text role="class"}.

### Queries

While `~odoo.Model.call`{.interpreted-text role="func"} is sufficient
for any interaction with Odoo models, Odoo Web provides a helper for
simpler and clearer querying of models (fetching of records based on
various conditions): `~odoo.Model.query`{.interpreted-text role="func"}
which acts as a shortcut for the common combination of
`~odoo.models.Model.search`{.interpreted-text role="py:meth"} and
`~odoo.models.Model.read`{.interpreted-text role=":py:meth"}. It
provides a clearer syntax to search and read models:

``` javascript
model.query(['name', 'login', 'user_email', 'signature'])
     .filter([['active', '=', true], ['company_id', '=', main_company]])
     .limit(15)
     .all().then(function (users) {
    // do work with users records
});
```

versus:

``` javascript
model.call('search', [['active', '=', true], ['company_id', '=', main_company]], {limit: 15})
    .then(function (ids) {
        return model.call('read', [ids, ['name', 'login', 'user_email', 'signature']]);
    })
    .then(function (users) {
        // do work with users records
    });
```

- `~odoo.web.Model.query`{.interpreted-text role="func"} takes an
  optional list of fields as parameter (if no field is provided, all
  fields of the model are fetched). It returns a
  `odoo.web.Query`{.interpreted-text role="class"} which can be further
  customized before being executed
- `~odoo.web.Query`{.interpreted-text role="class"} represents the query
  being built. It is immutable, methods to customize the query actually
  return a modified copy, so it\'s possible to use the original and the
  new version side-by-side. See `~odoo.web.Query`{.interpreted-text
  role="class"} for its customization options.

When the query is set up as desired, simply call
`~odoo.web.Query.all`{.interpreted-text role="func"} to execute it and
return a deferred to its result. The result is the same as
`~odoo.models.Model.read`{.interpreted-text role="py:meth"}\'s, an array
of dictionaries where each dictionary is a requested record, with each
requested field a dictionary key.

Pet Toys List

Create a `PetToysList` widget displaying 5 toys (using their name and
their images).

The pet toys are not stored in a new model, instead they\'re stored in
`product.product` using a special category *Pet Toys*. You can see the
pre-generated toys and add new ones by going to
`Pet Store --> Pet Store --> Pet Toys`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. You will probably need to explore
`product.product` to create the right domain to select just pet toys.

In Odoo, images are generally stored in regular fields encoded as
[base64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64), HTML supports displaying
images straight from base64 with
`<img src="data:{mime_type};base64,{base64_image_data}"/>`{.interpreted-text

The `PetToysList` widget should be displayed on the home page on the

## Existing web components

### The Action Manager

In Odoo, many operations start from an
`action <../reference/backend/actions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}:
opening a menu item (to a view), printing a report, \...

Actions are pieces of data describing how a client should react to the
activation of a piece of content. Actions can be stored (and read
through a model) or they can be generated on-the fly (locally to the
client by javascript code, or remotely by a method of a model).

In Odoo Web, the component responsible for handling and reacting to
these actions is the *Action Manager*.

#### Using the Action Manager

The action manager can be invoked explicitly from javascript code by
creating a dictionary describing
`an action <../reference/backend/actions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
of the right type, and calling an action manager instance with it.

`~odoo.Widget.do_action`{.interpreted-text role="func"} is a shortcut of
`~odoo.Widget`{.interpreted-text role="class"} looking up the
\"current\" action manager and executing the action:

``` javascript
instance.web.TestWidget = instance.Widget.extend({
    dispatch_to_new_action: function() {
        this.do_action({
            type: 'ir.actions.act_window',
            res_model: "product.product",
            res_id: 1,
            views: [[false, 'form']],
            target: 'current',
            context: {},
        });
    },
});
```

The most common action `type` is `ir.actions.act_window` which provides
views to a model (displays a model in various manners), its most common
attributes are:

`res_model`

:   The model to display in views

`res_id` (optional)

:   For form views, a preselected record in `res_model`

`views`

:   Lists the views available through the action. A list of
    `[view_id, view_type]`, `view_id` can either be the database
    identifier of a view of the right type, or `false` to use the view
    by default for the specified type. View types can not be present
    multiple times. The action will open the first view of the list by
    default.

`target`

:   Either `current` (the default) which replaces the \"content\"
    section of the web client by the action, or `new` to open the action
    in a dialog box.

`context`

:   Additional context data to use within the action.

### Client Actions {#howtos/web/client_actions}

Throughout this guide, we used a simple `HomePage` widget which the web
client automatically starts when we select the right menu item. But how
did the Odoo web know to start this widget? Because the widget is
registered as a *client action*.

A client action is (as its name implies) an action type defined almost
entirely in the client, in javascript for Odoo web. The server simply
sends an action tag (an arbitrary name), and optionally adds a few
parameters, but beyond that *everything* is handled by custom client
code.

Our widget is registered as the handler for the client action through
this:

``` javascript
instance.web.client_actions.add('petstore.homepage', 'instance.oepetstore.HomePage');
```

`instance.web.client_actions` is a
`~odoo.web.Registry`{.interpreted-text role="class"} in which the action
manager looks up client action handlers when it needs to execute one.
The first parameter of `~odoo.web.Registry.add`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} is the name (tag) of the client action, and the second
parameter is the path to the widget from the Odoo web client root.

When a client action must be executed, the action manager looks up its
tag in the registry, walks the specified path and displays the widget it
finds at the end.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

a client action handler can also be a regular function, in which case
it\'ll be called and its result (if any) will be interpreted as the next
action to execute.
::::

On the server side, we had simply defined an `ir.actions.client` action:

``` xml
<record id="action_home_page" model="ir.actions.client">
    <field name="tag">petstore.homepage</field>
</record>
```

and a menu opening the action:

``` xml
<menuitem id="home_page_petstore_menu" parent="petstore_menu"
          name="Home Page" action="action_home_page"/>
```

### Architecture of the Views

Much of Odoo web\'s usefulness (and complexity) resides in views. Each
view type is a way of displaying a model in the client.

#### The View Manager

When an `ActionManager` instance receive an action of type
`ir.actions.act_window`, it delegates the synchronization and handling
of the views themselves to a *view manager*, which will then set up one
or multiple views depending on the original action\'s requirements:

![image](web/viewarchitecture.png){.align-center width="40.0%"}

#### The Views

Most
`Odoo views <../reference/user_interface/view_records>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} are implemented through a subclass of
`odoo.web.View`{.interpreted-text role="class"} which provides a bit of
generic basic structure for handling events and displaying model
information.

The *search view* is considered a view type by the main Odoo framework,
but handled separately by the web client (as it\'s a more permanent
fixture and can interact with other views, which regular views don\'t
do).

A view is responsible for loading its own description XML (using
`~odoo.models.Model.fields_view_get`{.interpreted-text role="py:class"})
and any other data source it needs. To that purpose, views are provided
with an optional view identifier set as the
`~odoo.web.View.view_id`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} attribute.

Views are also provided with a `~odoo.web.DataSet`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} instance which holds most necessary model information (the
model name and possibly various record ids).

Views may also want to handle search queries by overriding
`~odoo.web.View.do_search`{.interpreted-text role="func"}, and updating
their `~odoo.web.DataSet`{.interpreted-text role="class"} as necessary.

### The Form View Fields

A common need is the extension of the web form view to add new ways of
displaying fields.

All built-in fields have a default display implementation, a new form
widget may be necessary to correctly interact with a new field type
(e.g. a `GIS`{.interpreted-text role="term"} field) or to provide new
representations and ways to interact with existing field types (e.g.
validate `~odoo.fields.Char`{.interpreted-text role="py:class"} fields
which should contain email addresses and display them as email links).

To explicitly specify which form widget should be used to display a
field, simply use the `widget` attribute in the view\'s XML description:

``` xml
<field name="contact_mail" widget="email"/>
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

- the same widget is used in both \"view\" (read-only) and \"edit\"
  modes of a form view, it\'s not possible to use a widget in one and an
  other widget in the other
- and a given field (name) can not be used multiple times in the same
  form
- a widget may ignore the current mode of the form view and remain the
  same in both view and edit modes
::::

::: todo
most of this should probably move to an advanced form view guide
:::

Fields are instantiated by the form view after it has read its XML
description and constructed the corresponding HTML representing that
description. After that, the form view will communicate with the field
objects using some methods. These methods are defined by the
`FieldInterface` interface. Almost all fields inherit the
`AbstractField` abstract class. That class defines some default
mechanisms that need to be implemented by most fields.

Here are some of the responsibilities of a field class:

- The field class must display and allow the user to edit the value of
  the field.
- It must correctly implement the 3 field attributes available in all
  fields of Odoo. The `AbstractField` class already implements an
  algorithm that dynamically calculates the value of these attributes
  (they can change at any moment because their value change according to
  the value of other fields). Their values are stored in *Widget
  Properties* (the widget properties were explained earlier in this
  guide). It is the responsibility of each field class to check these
  widget properties and dynamically adapt depending of their values.
  Here is a description of each of these attributes:
  - `required`: The field must have a value before saving. If `required`
    is `true` and the field doesn\'t have a value, the method
    `is_valid()` of the field must return `false`.
  - `invisible`: When this is `true`, the field must be invisible. The
    `AbstractField` class already has a basic implementation of this
    behavior that fits most fields.
  - `readonly`: When `true`, the field must not be editable by the user.
    Most fields in Odoo have a completely different behavior depending
    on the value of `readonly`. As example, the `FieldChar` displays an
    HTML `<input>` when it is editable and simply displays the text when
    it is read-only. This also means it has much more code it would need
    to implement only one behavior, but this is necessary to ensure a
    good user experience.
- Fields have two methods, `set_value()` and `get_value()`, which are
  called by the form view to give it the value to display and get back
  the new value entered by the user. These methods must be able to
  handle the value as given by the Odoo server when a `read()` is
  performed on a model and give back a valid value for a `write()`.
  Remember that the JavaScript/Python data types used to represent the
  values given by `read()` and given to `write()` is not necessarily the
  same in Odoo. As example, when you read a many2one, it is always a
  tuple whose first value is the id of the pointed record and the second
  one is the name get (ie: `(15, "Agrolait")`). But when you write a
  many2one it must be a single integer, not a tuple anymore.
  `AbstractField` has a default implementation of these methods that
  works well for simple data type and set a widget property named
  `value`.

Please note that, to better understand how to implement fields, you are
strongly encouraged to look at the definition of the `FieldInterface`
interface and the `AbstractField` class directly in the code of the Odoo
web client.

#### Creating a New Type of Field

In this part we will explain how to create a new type of field. The
example here will be to re-implement the `FieldChar` class and
progressively explain each part.

##### Simple Read-Only Field

Here is a first implementation that will only display text. The user
will not be able to modify the content of the field.

``` javascript
local.FieldChar2 = instance.web.form.AbstractField.extend({
    init: function() {
        this._super.apply(this, arguments);
        this.set("value", "");
    },
    render_value: function() {
        this.$el.text(this.get("value"));
    },
});

instance.web.form.widgets.add('char2', 'instance.oepetstore.FieldChar2');
```

In this example, we declare a class named `FieldChar2` inheriting from
`AbstractField`. We also register this class in the registry
`instance.web.form.widgets` under the key `char2`. That will allow us to
use this new field in any form view by specifying `widget="char2"` in
the `<field/>` tag in the XML declaration of the view.

In this example, we define a single method: `render_value()`. All it
does is display the widget property `value`. Those are two tools defined
by the `AbstractField` class. As explained before, the form view will
call the method `set_value()` of the field to set the value to display.
This method already has a default implementation in `AbstractField`
which simply sets the widget property `value`. `AbstractField` also
watch the `change:value` event on itself and calls the `render_value()`
when it occurs. So, `render_value()` is a convenience method to
implement in child classes to perform some operation each time the value
of the field changes.

In the `init()` method, we also define the default value of the field if
none is specified by the form view (here we assume the default value of
a `char` field should be an empty string).

##### Read-Write Field

Read-only fields, which only display content and don\'t allow the user
to modify it can be useful, but most fields in Odoo also allow editing.
This makes the field classes more complicated, mostly because fields are
supposed to handle both editable and non-editable mode, those modes are
often completely different (for design and usability purpose) and the
fields must be able to switch between modes at any moment.

To know in which mode the current field should be, the `AbstractField`
class sets a widget property named `effective_readonly`. The field
should watch for changes in that widget property and display the correct
mode accordingly. Example:

``` javascript
local.FieldChar2 = instance.web.form.AbstractField.extend({
    init: function() {
        this._super.apply(this, arguments);
        this.set("value", "");
    },
    start: function() {
        this.on("change:effective_readonly", this, function() {
            this.display_field();
            this.render_value();
        });
        this.display_field();
        return this._super();
    },
    display_field: function() {
        var self = this;
        this.$el.html(QWeb.render("FieldChar2", {widget: this}));
        if (! this.get("effective_readonly")) {
            this.$("input").change(function() {
                self.internal_set_value(self.$("input").val());
            });
        }
    },
    render_value: function() {
        if (this.get("effective_readonly")) {
            this.$el.text(this.get("value"));
        } else {
            this.$("input").val(this.get("value"));
        }
    },
});

instance.web.form.widgets.add('char2', 'instance.oepetstore.FieldChar2');
```

``` xml
<t t-name="FieldChar2">
    <div class="oe_field_char2">
        <t t-if="! widget.get('effective_readonly')">
            <input type="text"></input>
        </t>
    </div>
</t>
```

In the `start()` method (which is called immediately after a widget has
been appended to the DOM), we bind on the event
`change:effective_readonly`. That allows us to redisplay the field each
time the widget property `effective_readonly` changes. This event
handler will call `display_field()`, which is also called directly in
`start()`. This `display_field()` was created specifically for this
field, it\'s not a method defined in `AbstractField` or any other class.
We can use this method to display the content of the field depending on
the current mode.

From now on the conception of this field is typical, except there is a
lot of verifications to know the state of the `effective_readonly`
property:

- In the QWeb template used to display the content of the widget, it
  displays an `<input type="text" />` if we are in read-write mode and
  nothing in particular in read-only mode.
- In the `display_field()` method, we have to bind on the `change` event
  of the `<input type="text" />` to know when the user has changed the
  value. When it happens, we call the `internal_set_value()` method with
  the new value of the field. This is a convenience method provided by
  the `AbstractField` class. That method will set a new value in the
  `value` property but will not trigger a call to `render_value()`
  (which is not necessary since the `<input type="text" />` already
  contains the correct value).
- In `render_value()`, we use a completely different code to display the
  value of the field depending if we are in read-only or in read-write
  mode.

Create a Color Field

Create a `FieldColor` class. The value of this field should be a string
containing a color code like those used in CSS (example: `#FF0000` for
red). In read-only mode, this color field should display a little block
whose color corresponds to the value of the field. In read-write mode,
you should display an `<input type="color" />`. That type of `<input />`
is an HTML5 component that doesn\'t work in all browsers but works well
in Google Chrome. So it\'s OK to use as an exercise.

You can use that widget in the form view of the `message_of_the_day`
model for its field named `color`. As a bonus, you can change the
`MessageOfTheDay` widget created in the previous part of this guide to
display the message of the day with the background color indicated in
the `color` field.

### The Form View Custom Widgets

Form fields are used to edit a single field, and are intrinsically
linked to a field. Because this may be limiting, it is also possible to
create *form widgets* which are not so restricted and have less ties to
a specific lifecycle.

Custom form widgets can be added to a form view through the `widget`
tag:

``` xml
<widget type="xxx" />
```

This type of widget will simply be created by the form view during the
creation of the HTML according to the XML definition. They have
properties in common with the fields (like the `effective_readonly`
property) but they are not assigned a precise field. And so they don\'t
have methods like `get_value()` and `set_value()`. They must inherit
from the `FormWidget` abstract class.

Form widgets can interact with form fields by listening for their
changes and fetching or altering their values. They can access form
fields through their
`~odoo.web.form.FormWidget.field_manager`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}
attribute:

``` javascript
local.WidgetMultiplication = instance.web.form.FormWidget.extend({
    start: function() {
        this._super();
        this.field_manager.on("field_changed:integer_a", this, this.display_result);
        this.field_manager.on("field_changed:integer_b", this, this.display_result);
        this.display_result();
    },
    display_result: function() {
        var result = this.field_manager.get_field_value("integer_a") *
                     this.field_manager.get_field_value("integer_b");
        this.$el.text("a*b = " + result);
    }
});

instance.web.form.custom_widgets.add('multiplication', 'instance.oepetstore.WidgetMultiplication');
```

`~odoo.web.form.FormWidget`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} is generally
the `~odoo.web.form.FormView`{.interpreted-text role="class"} itself,
but features used from it should be limited to those defined by
`~odoo.web.form.FieldManagerMixin`{.interpreted-text role="class"}, the
most useful being:

- `~odoo.web.form.FieldManagerMixin.get_field_value(field_name)`{.interpreted-text
  role="func"} which returns the value of a field.
- `~odoo.web.form.FieldManagerMixin.set_values(values)`{.interpreted-text
  role="func"} sets multiple field values, takes a mapping of
  `{field_name: value_to_set}`
- An event `field_changed:{field_name}`{.interpreted-text role="samp"}
  is triggered any time the value of the field called `field_name` is
  changed

Get the Current Coordinate

Add a button resetting the product\'s coordinates to the location of the
user, you can get these coordinates using the [javascript geolocation
API](http://diveintohtml5.info/geolocation.html).

Now we would like to display an additional button to automatically set
the coordinates to the location of the current user.

To get the coordinates of the user, an easy way is to use the
geolocation JavaScript API. [See the online documentation to know how to
use it](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp).

Please also note that the user should not be able to click on that
button when the form view is in read-only mode. So, this custom widget
should handle correctly the `effective_readonly` property just like any
field. One way to do this would be to make the button disappear when
`effective_readonly` is true.

# Chapter 1 - Theming

Now that you have Odoo installed and your server is running locally,
it\'s time to create your own theme module for your website.

## Setup {#tutorials/website_theme/theming/setup}

| The first step is to ensure that Odoo is running correctly locally. To
  do this, use a Shell script to run the server.
| In this script, define the database name and install only the
  [website]{.title-ref} module.

::: seealso
See reference documentation on how to
`run Odoo <website_themes/setup/getting_started>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
:::

## Build your module structure {#tutorials/website_theme/theming/module}

Now that we know everything is working properly, let\'s start building
our module.

Based on the following structure, start creating your module that will
be used as a theme. This is where you are going to add your XML pages,
SCSS, JS, ...

::: seealso
See reference documentation on how to structure your
`theming/module`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
:::

| Start with the basics : `/data`{.interpreted-text role="file"},
  `/img`{.interpreted-text role="file"}, `/scss`{.interpreted-text
  role="file"}, `/js`{.interpreted-text role="file"}.
| Don\'t forget to add the `__init__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
  and `__manifest__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"} files.

In your `__manifest__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file, you can
declare your module with the following information:

- name (required)
- description
- category
- version
- author
- license
- depends

## Declare Odoo variables {#tutorials/website_theme/theming/odoo_variables}

In the `primary_variables.scss`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file, you
can override the default Odoo SCSS variables to match your design.

Based on the Airproof design, create your
`primary_variables.scss`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file and define
the following elements:

- Headings font family : Space Grotesk
- Content font family : Lato. For this, use these [2 woff
  files]({GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/fonts).
- The color palette name and the 5 main colors that compose it:
  [#000000]{.title-ref}, [#BBE1FA]{.title-ref}, [#CEF8A1]{.title-ref},
  [#FFFFFF]{.title-ref}, [#0B8EE6]{.title-ref}
- Header & Footer : Use one of the default templates for the moment, we
  will create a custom header later.

::: seealso
See reference documentation on how to use
`primary variables <theming/module/variables>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, as well as a list of all [primary
variables]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/website/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss)
available.
:::

| Restart your script to immediately see the application of your
  changes.
| Don\'t forget to add the path to your manifest in the script and set
  your module as the app to install.

To ensure your changes are applied correctly, log in to your website and
check that your color palette includes your specified colors.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You will need to override more variables to replicate the Airproof
design. Remember to add them throughout the creation of your website.

Solutions

To complete this exercise, you need to:

1.  Create your `primary_variables.scss`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
    file. You can find all the necessary information in the
    [primary_variables.scss]({GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss)
    file from our example module.
2.  Load your custom font in a
    [font.scss]({GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/scss/font.scss)
    file.
3.  Declare the 2 files you just created in
    `__manifest__.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"} as indicated in the
    documentation.
4.  Install your module via your script. In our example, it looks like
    this:

``` xml
./odoo-bin --addons-path=../enterprise,addons,../myprojects --db-filter=theming -d theming
--without-demo=all -i website_airproof --dev=xml
```
:::

## Declare Bootstrap variables {#tutorials/website_theme/theming/bootstrap_variables}

On top of the default Odoo variables, you can also redefine the
Bootstrap variables. Bootstrap is a front-end framework which is
included by default in Odoo.

Based on the Airproof design, define the following elements:

- Headings font sizes :
  - h1 : 3.125rem
  - h2 : 2.5rem
  - h3 : 2rem
  - h4 : 1.75rem
  - h5 : 1.5rem
  - h6 : 1.25rem
  - Display 1 : 6.25rem (Who will be useful for the main title of your
    homepage)
- Inputs border radius : 10px

## Define presets {#tutorials/website_theme/theming/presets}

In addition to the variables we have just covered, you can also activate
specific views to modify the design.

Add your `presets.xml`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file and based on
the Airproof design, activate the appropriate views to meet the
following client requests:

- Deactivate the Call-to-action in the header.
- Deactivate the wishlist feature in the shop but activate it on the
  product page.
- On the shop page, activate the filtering by categories only on the
  left side.

## Add building blocks {#tutorials/website_theme/build_website/building_blocks}

Now, let\'s get into the real work. Start adding content to the pages.

In an Odoo website, we create the content of a page using building
blocks. These can be compared to snippets editable by the user in the
Website Builder. The standard main container for any snippet is a
[section]{.title-ref}.

Based on the Airproof design, add the following elements to the homepage
:

- Create a section with the 3 boxes using the
  `Big boxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} building block.
  - For this section, you don\'t want the future user to be able to edit
    it via the Website Builder.
  - Put an opacity filter on the background image of the 3 boxes.
- Create another section containing a title and icons using the grid
  system.

You can use these
[images]({GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/img/content) and
[icons]({GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/img/content/icons).

some navigation adjustments.

The client has requested the following changes:

- Add the [Airproof
  logo]({GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/img/content/branding/airproof-logo.svg).
  At the same time, set the name and favicon of the website.
- Remove the link to the homepage and the shop.
- Add a link to the future "About us" page.
- Replace the default blog item with a dropdown to display the different
  blogs: "Our latest news" and "Tutorials".

## Add custom SCSS {#tutorials/website_theme/customisation_part1/custom_scss}

You\'ve adjusted Odoo and Bootstrap variables and set presets, yet you
still notice disparities between your website and the client\'s design.
The only solution is to incorporate custom SCSS.

In `theme.scss`{.interpreted-text role="file"}, reproduce the following
design elements:

- Add a **green underline** on active nav items.
- Modify the **arrow** for collapsible nav items.
- Modify the **slider\'s arrows** by adding a green background and
  changing their design.

## Create a custom header {#tutorials/website_theme/customisation_part1/custom_header}

With variables, presets, and custom SCSS in place, it\'s time to refine
the layout and add key cross-page elements, starting with the header.

1.  Based on the Airproof design, create a custom header with the
    following elements:

    - A custom shopping cart icon.
    - A login/user as a button.
    - Navigation text to 14px.

    You can find the [cart

    and [template
    illustration]({GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/img/wbuilder/template-header-opt.svg).

2.  In order for the client to find the mega menu you previously created
    for him, turn it into a template that can be found through the
    website builder.

3.  Place your new header over the content of your homepage.

::: seealso
See reference documentation on how to:

- create
  `custom headers <website_themes/layout/header/custom>`{.interpreted-text

Tip
:::

\- Base yourself on the code of existing header templates that you can
find in
[odoo/addons/website/views/website_templates.xml]({GITHUB_PATH}/addons/website/views/website_templates.xml). -
A good practise should be to create different files to manage your
custom views and templates. For example, everything concerning the
general layout (header, footer\...) in
`website_templates.xml`{.interpreted-text role="file"}, everything
related to blog in `website_blog_templates.xml`{.interpreted-text
role="file"}, to event in
`website_event_templates.xml`{.interpreted-text role="file"}, etc. - \|
To modify the cart icon, you can use an [XPath]{.title-ref}. \| Since
this is linked to eCommerce, place it in a new file called
`website_sale_templates.xml`{.interpreted-text role="file"}. - Don\'t
forget to continue making as many modifications as you can through the
`Bootstrap
variables`{.interpreted-text role="file"} and
`primary variables`{.interpreted-text role="file"} (font, colors,
size\...). You can use them to help you with this exercise.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note

Ensure that you properly call every template in your header (like the
shopping cart, language selector, call to action, etc.), so everything
will remain editable via the website builder and all options will be
available.

## Create a new dynamic snippets template {#tutorials/website_theme/customisation_part1/custom_dynamic_template}

| Dynamic snippets are useful building blocks. These allow you to fetch
  information from the backend and display it on the website according
  to certain filters.
| There are already several layout templates for displaying dynamic
  snippets. However, none of the existing templates fully match your
  client\'s needs.

Based on the Airproof design, create a custom template that you will
apply to a product dynamic snippet on the homepage.

1.  First, create a custom template that will be added to the list of
    dynamic products templates. It has to include the following
    elements:

    - Add a `Discover more`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} link.
    - Add a hover effect on cards.
    - Move the navigation arrows.

    You will find the [icons
    here]({GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/img/content/icons).

## Create a custom background shape {#tutorials/website_theme/customisation_part2/background_shape}

Shapes are decorative elements that can be applied to backgrounds or
images. They are SVG files that can be animated and customized with
different colors.

1.  To better align with the website\'s desired atmosphere, create a
    custom background shape that the client can reuse on different
    blocks.

    Create your custom shape using the following setup:

    - Declare your shape. You can find the original [SVG shape
      here]({GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/shape-waves.svg).
    - Set the base color of the shape to the theme\'s green, and add it
      to the list of available shapes.

::: seealso
See reference documentation on how to add a `custom background shapes
<website_themes/shapes/bg/custom>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Tip
:::

\| **Be careful,** there is a trick! \| In your shape SVG file, you have
to use the colors from the default Odoo palette. \| Here, I want it to
match my primary color 1 ([#CEF8A1]{.title-ref}). Therefore, in the SVG
file, you must use color 3 from Odoo's default palette
([#3AADAA]{.title-ref}).

  and
  [option.xml]({GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/views/snippets/options.xml).
:::

2.  Based on the Airproof design, apply the shape you just added to a
    [Text-Image]{.title-ref} building block on the homepage:
    - Ensure the shape is in the right position.
    - Set its color to the theme\'s light blue.

## Create a custom gradient {#tutorials/website_theme/customisation_part2/custom_gradient}

Next, let\'s add gradients to backgrounds. To enhance the page\'s
dynamism, apply a gradient from blue [rgb(11, 142, 230)]{.title-ref} to
dark blue [rgb(41, 128, 187)]{.title-ref} to your "*Latest products*"
block. But before that, add the gradient to the website builder so that
the client can easily reuse it.

## Animations {#tutorials/website_theme/customisation_part2/animations}

The client loves the overall design but finds the page a bit static.
Enhance page interactivity with animations such as
[fade-in]{.title-ref}, [rotate]{.title-ref}, [bounce]{.title-ref}, etc.
These can be applied to columns, images, texts, buttons...

Based on the airproof design, animate the following elements:

- the text of the first slide of the carousel.
- the sticker and the photo of the drone from the first slide.
- the 4 columns with icons.

Adjust animation delays for smoother transitions.

## Forms {#tutorials/website_theme/customisation_part2/forms}

The forms in Odoo are very powerful. They can send emails directly to a
personal inbox or integrate directly with other Odoo applications. This
is great, as one of your client\'s main priorities is after-sales
service. Therefore, the contact form must be properly configured.

Based on the airproof design, create a contact page. Remember to disable
the default one and add the new page link to the menu. The client has
the following requests for their contact form:

- *Name* and *email address* field.
- *Company name* field.
- *Conditional VAT* field displayed only if *Company name* is filled in.
- All fields should be mandatory, except for *Company name*.
- Form submission must trigger an email.
- After form submission, the [thank-you message]{.title-ref} should
  remain visible on the contact page.

See reference documentation on how to:

- `deactivate default pages <website_themes/pages/default>`{.interpreted-text

## Create a page template {#tutorials/website_theme/customisation_part2/page_template}

You don\'t have the time to create all the service pages for the client.
No worries! Create a template page that the client can use to build
their own service pages.

This page should be composed as follows:

- a `Parallax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} building block,
- a `Key benefits`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} building block
  with the title replaced by \"\*Discover our service\*\",
- a `Call to action`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} building block,
- your custom carousel snippet.

# Chapter 5 - Dynamic templates

## Adapt the shop template {#tutorials/website_theme/dynamic_templates/shop}

Now, let\'s adapt the dynamic sections of the website. As you may know,
some pages such as those for eCommerce are automatically generated.
Pages like the shop, product, and checkout are automatically generated
when the [website_sale]{.title-ref} application is installed. These
template pages pull their displayed information from the backend.

To modify these pages, we need to edit the standard Odoo template. This
can be done using SCSS, presets, and especially XPath. Locate the
standard Odoo template you want to modify and extend it using
[XPath]{.title-ref}. Following the Airproof design, let\'s begin by
modifying the shop view.

1.  First, locate the standard template in Odoo :
    `website_sale --> templates.xml -->
    id="products"`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
2.  Apply all changes in your
    `website_sale_templates.xml`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file.
    Start by:
    - Add a banner.
    - Adapt the filtering on the left.
    - Remove the search bar (you can remove it from both the shop and
      the product pages at the same time).
    - Move the breadcrumb.
    - Hide the list or grid view option.
    - Display only 3 products per row.
    - Create the appropriate design and information for the product
      cards.

![image](05_dynamic_templates/airproof-shop-page.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- Apply your modifications using presets, XPath and SCSS. - To enable
attribute/variant filtering, activate the
`/applications/sales/sales/products_prices/products/variants`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} option in the website backend settings and
`configure attributes and variants
<ecommerce/categories_variants/product-variants>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for the products.

part *shop page*, and
[shop.scss]({GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/scss/pages/shop.scss).
:::

## Adapt the product page template {#tutorials/website_theme/dynamic_templates/product}

The client is thrilled with the shop modifications. Next, let\'s apply
our design to the product pages. Based on the Airproof design below,
adapt a few elements including:

- Remove the search bar (if not done with the previous exercise).
- Move the breadcrumb.
- Remove the quantity selector, Terms and Conditions, and share icons.
- Update the `Add to cart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
  icon.
- Enable the accordion \"\*More information\*\".
- Insert the product specifications (section that only appears when the
  product has just one variant per attribute) into the accordion
  containing the \"\*more information\*\" section.
- Design the appropriate layout for the product images carousel.
- Add a title and apply the previously created product template to the
  [Alternative products]{.title-ref} section (ensure alternative
  products are assigned on the product in the backend for this section
  to appear).
- Implement a new drop zone below product details, visible on all
  products. As a use case, add an [Text-Image]{.title-ref} building
  block using the Website Builder (e.g.: See Airproof product page
  screenshot with "*Six reasons to buy...*").

\- Make your modifications using presets, XPath, and SCSS. Be sure to
comment your code properly so you can find your way around. - The drop
zone will be visible on all products. To create a specific dropzone per
product, you need to add a new field to the product model.

# Chapter 6 - Going live

## Translations {#tutorials/website_theme/going_live/translations}

Congratulations! Your client has a beautifully designed homepage and
contact page, and the eCommerce is fully adapted to the Airproof design.
Amazing!

Now, the client wants the website translated into French. To do so:

1.  Add French to the website in the settings and enable the language
    switcher in the header via presets.
2.  Then for the translation itself, you have two options. We shall
    therefore test both:
    - Translate the content of the homepage carousel through the
      backend.
    - But for the menu, make the translations through the frontend.
3.  Export the French `.po`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file for your
    Airproof module and place it in the `/i18n`{.interpreted-text
    role="file"} translations folder.
4.  If you would like, you can add more translations directly by editing
    the `.po`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file. (Using Poedit
    software, your code editor, or another translation tool.)

::: seealso
See reference documentation on
`website_themes/translations/backend`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`website_themes/translations/frontend`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
translations, and how to
`website_themes/translations/export`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} them.
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Be careful when using Poedit, as it doesn\'t handle tags with styles
well and generates an `.mo`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file. - To
see the changes made directly via the `.po`{.interpreted-text
role="file"} file, you will need to manually import the file.

## Module import {#tutorials/website_theme/going_live/module_import}

Great job! The website is now completely finished and your module is
ready for installation in the client\'s SaaS database.

Just before that, test the import process on a new database.

Tip
:::

\- Ensure the [base_import_module]{.title-ref} is installed on the
database before the module installation. - Verify all required
applications are installed. - Skip the theme installation steps and
start from scratch. - Manually import translations after module
installation, as they won\'t apply automatically.
::::

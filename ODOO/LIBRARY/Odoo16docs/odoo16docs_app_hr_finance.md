To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Online Synchronization`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the institution you want to fetch the
other accounts. Click on *Fetch Accounts* button to start the flow.

Don\'t forget to keep authorization for existing accounts (for all
institutions that you have synchronized with Ponto).

## FAQ

### After my synchronization, no account appears

You selected an institution from the list and did not authorize any
accounts from this institution.

### I have an error about that my authorization has expired

Every **3 months** (90 days) you must re-authorize the connection
between your bank account and Ponto. This must be done from the [Ponto
website](https://myponto.com). If you do not do this, the
synchronization will stop for these accounts.

### I have some errors with my beta institution

Ponto provides institutions in *beta*, these institutions are not
directly supported by Odoo and we advise you to contact Ponto directly.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Using an institution in beta is beneficial for Ponto, it allows them to
have real feedback on the connection with the institution.

## FAQ

### I have an error when I try to delete my synchronization within Odoo

Odoo can\'t permanently delete the connection you have created with the
banking institution. However, it can revoke the consent you gave so that
Odoo won\'t be able to access your account anymore. The error you are
seeing is probably a message telling you that the consent was revoked,
but the record could not be deleted as it still exists within Salt edge.
If you want to remove the connection completely, please connect to your
[Salt Edge account](https://www.saltedge.com/dashboard) and manually
delete your synchronization. Once this is done, you can go back to Odoo
to delete the record.

### I have an error saying that I have already synchronized this account

You have probably already synchronized your bank account with Salt Edge,
please check on your [dashboard](https://www.saltedge.com/dashboard)
that you don\'t already have a connection with the same credentials.

In case you already have a synchronization with the same credentials
present on your Salt Edge dashboard and this synchronization has not
been created with Odoo, please delete it and create it from your Odoo
database.

In case you already have a connection with the same credentials present
on your Salt Edge dashboard and this synchronization was created with
Odoo, you will normally be able to find it by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Online Synchronization`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Please make sure to do an *Update Credentials* to
reactivate the connection.

# Bank synchronization

Odoo can synchronize directly with your bank institution to get all bank
statements imported automatically into your database.

To check if your bank is compatible with Odoo, go to [Odoo Accounting
Features](https://www.odoo.com/page/accounting-features), and click on
`See list of supported institutions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Odoo supports more than 25,000 institutions around the world.

To connect to the banks, Odoo uses multiple web-services:

- **Plaid**: United States of America and Canada
- **Yodlee**: Worldwide
- `Salt Edge <bank_synchronization/saltedge>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: Worldwide
- `Ponto <bank_synchronization/ponto>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}:
  Europe
- `Enable Banking <bank_synchronization/enablebanking>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: Scandinavian countries

::: seealso
`transactions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Configuration

### On-Premise users

To be able to use this service, you need to have a valid Odoo Enterprise
subscription. So make sure that your database is registered with your
Odoo Enterprise contract. We also use a proxy between your database and
the third party provider so, in case of a connection error, please check
that you don\'t have a firewall or a proxy blocking the following
address:

- <https://production.odoofin.com/>

### First synchronization

You can start synchronization either by going to the Accounting app and
`Accounting Dashboard --> Configuration --> Banks: Add a Bank Account`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Now you can search for your bank institution. Select it and follow the
steps to synchronize with it.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If you have any issues during your first synchronization, please verify
that your web browser doesn\'t block pop-ups and that your ad-blocker is
disabled.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When choosing the date for the first bank statement synchronization,
pick the date when you start recording accounting transaction on your
Odoo accounting database. For example, if you import your closing
balance in Odoo on the 31/12/2022 and you start recording accounting
transactions on the 01/01/2023, your synchronization date should be
01/01/2023.
::::

You must provide a phone number during your first synchronization to
secure your account. We ask for such information because we don\'t want
your data falling into the wrong hands. Therefore, if we detect
suspicious activities on your account, we block all requests coming from
your account, and you need to reactivate it using that phone number.

The third-party provider may request more information in order to
connect with your bank institution. This information is not stored on
Odoo\'s servers.

By default, transactions fetched from an online source are grouped
inside the same statement, and one bank statement is created per month.
You can change the bank statement creation periodicity in your journal
settings.

You can find all your synchronizations by going to
`Accounting Dashboard -->
Configuration --> Accounting: Online Synchronization`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

### Synchronize manually

After your first synchronization, the created journals are synchronized
by default every 12 hours. If you wish, you can synchronize manually by
clicking on the `Synchronize Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button on the dashboard.

Or you can go to `Accounting Dashboard --> Configuration -->
Accounting: Online Synchronization`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select your institution and then click on the
`fetch transactions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Some institutions do not allow transactions to be fetched automatically.
For such institutions, during the automatic synchronization of the
account, you receive an error message asking you to disable the
automatic synchronization. This message can be found in the chatter of
your online synchronizations. In this case, make sure to perform manual
synchronizations.
::::

## Issues

### Synchronization in error

To report a connection error to the [Odoo
support](https://www.odoo.com/help), go to
`Accounting Dashboard--> Configuration --> Accounting: Online Synchronization`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select the connection that failed, and copy the
error description and the reference.

### Synchronization disconnected

If your connection with the proxy is disconnected, you can reconnect
with the proxy using the `Fetch Account`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If you are unable to reconnect using the
`Fetch Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, please
contact the [support](https://www.odoo.com/help) directly with your
client id or the reference of the error listed in the chatter.
::::

## Migration process for users having installed Odoo before December 2020 {#MigrationOnlineSync}

If you are on-premise, please first make sure that your source is
up-to-date with the latest version of Odoo.

Users who have created a database before December 2020 need to install
the new module manually to use the new functionalities.

To do so, go to `Apps --> Update Apps List`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, remove the default filter in the search bar and
type [account_online_synchronization]{.title-ref}. You can then click on
`Install`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Finally, make sure all
your users refresh their Odoo page by pressing CTRL+F5.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

- All previous synchronizations are disconnected during the installation
  and won\'t work anymore.
- You can find them directly in the synchronization menu
  (`Accounting Dashboard --> Configuration -->
  Accounting: Online Synchronization`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}). It is not possible to resynchronize these
  connections; you have to make new ones.
- Do not uninstall [account_online_sync]{.title-ref}, which is the
  previous module for online synchronization. The new one overrides it.
- By default, [account_online_synchronization]{.title-ref} is installed
  automatically with Accounting.
::::

## FAQ

### The synchronization is not working in real-time. Is that normal?

The process is not intended to work in real-time as third party
providers synchronize your accounts at different intervals. To force the
synchronization and fetch the statements, go to your
`Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click on
the `Synchronize Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. You can
also synchronize and fetch transactions through
`Accounting Dashboard -->
Configuration --> Accounting: Online Synchronization`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Some providers only allow one refresh per day, so
it is possible that clicking on `Synchronize Now`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} does not get your latest transactions if you already
performed such action earlier in the day.

A transaction can be visible on your bank account but not be fetched if
it has the status `Pending`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Only
transactions with the `Posted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status
will be retrieved. If the transaction is not **Posted** yet, you will
have to wait until the status changes.

### Is the Online Bank Synchronization feature included in my contract?

- **Community Version**: No, this feature is not included in the
  Community Version.
- **Online Version**: Yes, even if you benefit from the One App Free
  contract.
- **Enterprise Version**: Yes, if you have a valid enterprise contract
  linked to your database.

### Some banks have a status \"Beta.\" What does this mean?

This means that banking institutions are not yet fully supported by our
Third Party Provider. Bugs or other problems may arise. Odoo does not
support technical problems that occur with banks in the Beta phase, but
the user may still choose to connect. Connecting with these banks
contributes to the development process since the Provider will have real
data and feedback from the connection.

### Why do my transactions only synchronize when I refresh manually?

Some banks have additional security measures and require extra steps,
such as an SMS/email authentication code or another type of MFA. Because
of this, the integrator cannot pull transactions until the security code
is provided.

### Not all of my past transactions are in Odoo, why?

For some institutions, transactions can only be fetched up to 3 months
in the past.

### Why don\'t I see any transactions?

During your first synchronization, you selected the bank accounts you
decided to synchronize with Odoo. If you didn\'t synchronize any of your
accounts, you can go to
`Accounting Dashboard --> Configuration --> Accounting: Online Synchronization`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to click on the `Fetch Account`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the connection.

There may also be no new transactions.

If your bank account is properly linked to a journal and posted
transactions are not visible in your database, please [submit a support
ticket](https://www.odoo.com/help).

### How can I update my bank credentials?

You can update your credentials by going to `Accounting Dashboard -->
Configuration --> Accounting: Online Synchronization`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"},open the connection you want to update your
credentials and click on the `Update Credentials`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

# Manage a bank account in a foreign currency

In Odoo, every transaction is recorded in the default currency of the
company, and reports are all based on that default currency. When you
have a bank account in a foreign currency, for every transaction, Odoo
stores two values:

- The debit/credit in the currency of the *company*;
- The debit/credit in the currency of the *bank account*.

Currency rates are updated automatically using the web services of a
banking institution. By default, Odoo uses the European Central Bank\'s
web services but other options are available.

## Configuration

### Activate multi-currencies

To work with multiple currencies, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings
--> Currencies`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and tick
`Multi-Currencies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Under
`Post Exchange difference
entries in:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, provide a
`Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
`Gain Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
`Loss Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and then click on
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Configure currencies

Once Odoo is configured to support multiple currencies, they are all
created by default, but not necessarily active. To activate the new
currencies, click on `Activate Other Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} under the `Multi-Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} setting or go to `Accounting --> Configuration
--> Accounting: Currencies`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

When the currencies are activated, you can choose to **automate** the
currency rate update, or leave it on **manual**. To configure the rate
update, go back to `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings --> Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, check
`Automatic Currency Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, set
`Interval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to your desired frequency,
and then click on `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. You also
have the option to choose the `Service`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} you wish to obtain currency rates from.

Click on the Update now button (`🗘`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"})
besides the `Next Run`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
update the currency rates manually.

### Create a new bank account

In the accounting application, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and create a new one. Enter a
`Journal Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and set the
`Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to [Bank]{.title-ref}. In the
`Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, enter a
**short code**, a **currency**, and then finally click on the
`Bank Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to create a new
account. In the pop-up window of the account creation, enter a name, a
code (ex.: 550007), set its type to [Bank and Cash]{.title-ref}, set a
currency type, and save. When you are back on the **journal**, click on
the `Account Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and in
the pop-up window, fill out the `Account Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of your
account, and save.

![Example of a created bank journal.](foreign_currency/foreign-journal.png){.align-center}

Upon creation of the journal, Odoo automatically links the bank account
to the journal. It can be found under
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Accounting: Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

## Vendor bill in a foreign currency

To pay a bill in a foreign currency, simply select the currency next to
the `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field and register the
payment. Odoo automatically creates and posts the foreign **exchange
gain or loss** as a new journal entry.

![How to set a bill currency.](foreign_currency/foreign-bill-currency.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Note that you can pay a foreign bill with another currency. In that
case, Odoo automatically converts between the two currencies.
::::

## Unrealized Currency Gains/Losses Report

This report gives an overview of all unrealized amounts in a foreign
currency on your balance sheet, and allows you to adjust an entry or
manually set an exchange rate. To access this report, go to
`Reporting --> Management: Unrealized Currency Gains/Losses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. From here, you have access to all open entries in
your **balance sheet**.

![View of the Unrealized Gains/Losses journal.](foreign_currency/foreign-gains-losses.png){.align-center}

If you wish to use a different currency rate than the one set in
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings --> Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click the `Exchange Rates`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button and change the rate of the foreign currencies in
the report.

![Menu to manually change exchange rates.](foreign_currency/foreign-exchange-rates.png){.align-center}

When manually changing **exchange rates**, a yellow banner appears
allowing you to reset back to Odoo\'s rate. To do so, simply click on
`Reset to Odoo's Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Banner to reset back to Odoo\'s rates.](foreign_currency/foreign-reset-rates.png){.align-center}

In order to update your **balance sheet** with the amount of the
`adjustment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, click on the
`Adjustment Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. In the
pop-up window, select a `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Expense Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Income Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to calculate and
process the **unrealized gains and losses**.

You can set the date of the report in the `Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. Odoo automatically reverses the booking entry to
the date set in `Reversal Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Once posted, the `adjustment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column
should indicate [0.00]{.title-ref}, meaning all **unrealized
gains/losses** have been adjusted.

# Bank reconciliation

**Bank reconciliation** is the process of matching your
`bank transactions <transactions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} with
your business records, such as
`customer invoices <../customer_invoices>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, `vendor bills
<../vendor_bills>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, and
`payments <../payments>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. Not only is this
compulsory for most businesses, but it also offers several benefits,
such as reduced risk of errors in financial reports, detection of
fraudulent activities, and improved cash flow management.

Thanks to the bank
`reconciliation models <reconciliation_models>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, Odoo pre-selects the matching entries automatically.

reconciliation](https://www.odoo.com/slides/slide/bank-reconciliation-6562) -

`transactions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Bank reconciliation view

To access a bank journal\'s **reconciliation view**, go to your
`Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and either:

- click the journal name (e.g., `Bank`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}) to display all transactions, including those
  previously reconciled or
- click the `Reconcile items`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
  to display all transactions Odoo pre-selected for reconciliation. You
  can remove the `Not Matched`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter
  from the search bar to include previously reconciled transactions.

![Reaching the bank reconciliation tool from your accounting dashboard](reconciliation/bank-card.png)

The bank reconciliation view is structured into three distinct sections:
transactions, counterpart entries, and resulting entry.

![The user interface of the reconciliation view of a bank journal.](reconciliation/user-interface.png)

Transactions

:   The transactions section on the left shows all bank transactions,
    with the newest displayed first. Click a transaction to select it.

Counterpart entries

:   The counterpart entries section on the bottom right displays the
    options to match the selected bank transaction. Multiple tabs are
    available, including
    `reconciliation/existing-entries`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
    `reconciliation/batch-payments`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
    `reconciliation/manual-operations`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
    and `Discuss`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which contains the
    chatter for the selected bank transaction.

Resulting entry

:   The resulting entry section on the top right displays the selected
    bank transaction matched with the counterpart entries and includes
    any remaining debits or credits. In this section, you can validate
    the reconciliation or mark it as `To Check`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}. Any `reconciliation model
    buttons <reconciliation/button>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are
    also available in the resulting entry section.

## Reconcile transactions

Transactions can be matched automatically with the use of
`reconciliation models
<reconciliation_models>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, or they can be
matched with `existing entries
<reconciliation/existing-entries>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`batch payments <reconciliation/batch-payments>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`manual operations <reconciliation/manual-operations>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and `reconciliation model buttons
<reconciliation/button>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

1.  Select a transaction among unmatched bank transactions.
2.  Define the counterpart. There are several options for defining a
    counterpart, including
    `matching existing entries <reconciliation/existing-entries>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, `manual operations
    <reconciliation/manual-operations>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
    `batch payments <reconciliation/batch-payments>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, and
    `reconciliation model buttons <reconciliation/button>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
3.  If the resulting entry isn\'t fully balanced, balance it by adding
    another existing counterpart entry or writing it off with a
    `manual operation <reconciliation/manual-operations>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
4.  Click the `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
    confirm the reconciliation and move to the next transaction.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If you aren\'t sure how to reconcile a particular transaction and would
like to deal with it later, use the `To Check`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button instead. All transactions marked as `To
Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be displayed using the
`To Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Bank transactions are posted on the **journal\'s suspense account**
until reconciliation. At this point, reconciliation modifies the
transaction journal entry by replacing the bank suspense account with
the corresponding receivable, payable, or outstanding account.
::::

### Match existing entries {#reconciliation/existing-entries}

This tab contains matching entries Odoo automatically pre-selects
according to the reconciliation models. The entry order is based on
`reconciliation models <reconciliation_models>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, with suggested entries appearing first.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The search bar within the `Match Existing Entries`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab allows you to search for specific journal items.
::::

### Batch payments {#reconciliation/batch-payments}

[Batch payments](payments/batch-payments) allow you to group different
payments to ease reconciliation. Use the
`Batch Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to find batch
payments for customers and vendors. Similarly to the
`Match Existing Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, the
`Batch Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab has a search bar
that allows you to search for specific batch payments.

### Manual operations {#reconciliation/manual-operations}

If there isn\'t an existing entry to match the selected transaction, you
may instead wish to reconcile the transaction manually by choosing the
correct account and amount. Then, complete any of the relevant optional
fields.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can use the `fully paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option
to reconcile a payment, even in cases where only a partial payment is
received. A new line appears in the resulting entry section to reflect
the open balance registered on the Account Receivable by default. You
can choose another account by clicking on the new line in the resulting
entry section and selecting the `Account`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to record the open balance.

![Click on fully paid to manually set an invoice as entirely paid.](reconciliation/fully-paid.png)
::::

### Reconciliation model buttons {#reconciliation/button}

Use a `reconciliation model <reconciliation_models>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} button for manual operations that are frequently used. These
custom buttons allow you to quickly reconcile bank transactions manually
and can also be used in combination with existing entries.

# Reconciliation models

Reconciliation models are used to automate the
`bank reconciliation <reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
process, which is especially handy when dealing with recurring entries
like bank fees. Reconciliation models can also be helpful in handling
`cash discounts <../customer_invoices/cash_discounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

Each model is created based on a
`model type <models/type>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`bank transaction
conditions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
\- `bank_synchronization`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} - [Odoo
Tutorials: Reconciliation
models](https://www.odoo.com/slides/slide/reconciliation-models-1841?fullscreen=1)
:::

## Reconciliation model types {#models/type}

The reconciliation models are available by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration
--> Banks: Reconciliation Models`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. For each reconciliation model, a
`Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be set. Three types of
models exist:

- `Button to generate counterpart entry`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: a button is created in the resulting entry section
  of the bank reconciliation view. If clicked, this button generates a
  counterpart entry to reconcile with the active transaction based on
  the rules set in the model. The rules specified in the model determine
  the counterpart entry\'s account(s), amount(s), label(s), and analytic
  distribution;
- `Rule to suggest counterpart entry`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: used for recurring transactions to match the
  transaction to a new entry based on conditions that must match the
  information on the transaction;
- `Rule to match invoices/bills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  used for recurring transactions to match the transaction to existing
  invoices, bills, or payments based on conditions that must match the
  information on the transaction.

## Default reconciliation models

In Odoo, different models are available by default depending on the
company\'s fiscal localization. These can be updated if needed. Users
can also create their own reconciliation models by clicking
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If a record matches with several reconciliation models, the first one in
the *sequence* of models is applied. You can rearrange the order by
dragging and dropping the handle next to the name.

![Rearrange the sequence of models in the list view.](reconciliation_models/list-view.png)
::::

### Invoices/Bills perfect match

This model should be at the top of the *sequence* of models, as it
enables Odoo to suggest matching existing invoices or bills with a bank
transaction based on set conditions.

![Set rules to trigger the reconciliation.](reconciliation_models/invoices-bills-perfect-match.png)

Odoo automatically reconciles the payment when the
`Auto-validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is selected,
and the model conditions are perfectly met. In this case, it expects to
find on the bank statement\'s line the invoice/payment\'s reference (as
`Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected) and the
partner\'s name (as `Partner is set`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
is selected) to suggest the correct counterpart entry and reconcile the
payment automatically.

### Invoices/Bills partial match if underpaid

This model suggests a customer invoice or vendor bill that partially
matches the payment when the amount received is slightly lower than the
invoice amount, for example in the case of **cash discounts**. The
difference is reconciled with the account indicated in the
`counterpart entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

The reconciliation model `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
`Rule to match invoices/bills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
the `Payment tolerance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should be
set.

![Set rules to trigger the reconciliation.](reconciliation_models/partial-match.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Payment tolerance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is only
applicable to lower payments. It is disregarded when an overpayment is
received.
::::

::: seealso
`../customer_invoices/cash_discounts`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

### Line with bank fees

This model suggests a counterpart entry according to the rules set in
the model. In this case, the reconciliation model
`Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
`Rule to suggest counterpart entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and the `Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be used for
example, to identify the information referring to the
`Bank fees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the label of the
transaction.

![Set rules to trigger the reconciliation.](reconciliation_models/bank-fees.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

[Regular expressions](https://regexone.com/), often abbreviated as
**Regex**, can be used in Odoo in various ways to search, validate, and
manipulate data within the system. Regex can be powerful but also
complex, so it\'s essential to use it judiciously and with a good
understanding of the patterns you\'re working with.

To use regular expressions in your reconciliation models, set the
`Transaction Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Match Regex`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and add your
expression. Odoo automatically retrieves the transactions that match
your Regex expression and the conditions specified in your model.

![Using Regex in Odoo](reconciliation_models/regex.png)
::::

## Partner mapping

Partner mapping allows you to establish rules for automatically matching
transactions to the correct partner account, saving time and reducing
the risk of errors that can occur during manual reconciliation. For
example, you can create a partner mapping rule for incoming payments
with specific reference numbers or keywords in the transaction
description. When an incoming payment meets these criteria, Odoo
automatically maps it to the corresponding customer\'s account.

To create a partner mapping rule, go to the
`Partner Mapping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and enter the
`Find Text in Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Find Text in Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Transactions

Importing transactions from your bank statements allows keeping track of
bank account transactions and reconciling them with the ones recorded in
your accounting.

`Bank synchronization <bank_synchronization>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} automates the process. However, if you do not want to use it
or if your bank is not yet supported, other options exist:

- `Import bank transactions <transactions/import>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} delivered by your bank;
- `Register bank transactions <transactions/register>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} manually.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`Grouping transactions by statement <transactions/statements>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} is optional.
::::

## Import transactions {#transactions/import}

Odoo supports multiple file formats to import transactions:

- SEPA recommended Cash Management format (CAMT.053);
- Comma-separated values (.CSV);
- Open Financial Exchange (.OFX);
- Quicken Interchange Format (.QIF);
- Belgium: Coded Statement of Account (.CODA).

To import a file, go to the `Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and in the `Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
journal, click on `Import Transactions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Import bank transactions from the bank journal](transactions/import-transactions.png)

Next, select the file and upload it.

After setting the necessary formatting options and mapping the file
columns with their related Odoo fields, you can run a
`Test`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `Import`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} your bank transactions.

::: seealso
`/applications/essentials/export_import_data`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Register bank transactions manually {#transactions/register}

You can also record your bank transactions manually. To do so, go to
`Accounting
Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click on the
`Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} journal, and then on
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Make sure to fill out the
`Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields to ease the
reconciliation process.

## Statements {#transactions/statements}

A **bank statement** is a document provided by a bank or financial
institution that lists the transactions that have occurred in a
particular bank account over a specified period of time.

In Odoo Accounting, it is optional to group transactions by their
related statement, but depending on your business flow, you may want to
record them for control purposes.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If you want to compare the ending balances of your bank statements with
the ending balances of your financial records, *don\'t forget to create
an opening transaction* to record the bank account balance as of the
date you begin synchronizing or importing transactions. This is
necessary to ensure the accuracy of your accounting.
::::

To access a list of statements, go to your
`Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click on the
vertical ellipsis (`⋮`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) button next
to the bank or cash journal you want to check, then on
`Statements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

### Statement creation from the kanban view

Open the bank reconciliation view by clicking on the name of the bank
journal, and identify the transaction corresponding to the last
transaction of your bank statement. Click on the
`STATEMENT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button when hovering on
the upper separator line.

![A \"STATEMENT\" button is visible when hovering on the line separating two transactions.](transactions/statements-kanban.png)

Fill out the statement\'s details and save. The newly created statement
includes the previous transactions following the last statement.

### Statement creation from the list view

Open the list of transactions by clicking on the name of the bank
journal and switching to the list view. Select all the transactions
corresponding to the bank statement, and, in the
`Statement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, select an
existing statement or create a new one by typing its reference, clicking
on `Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, filling out
the statement\'s details, and saving.

## Outstanding accounts {#bank/outstanding-accounts}

By default, payments are registered through transitory accounts named
**outstanding accounts**, before being recorded in your bank account.

- An **outstanding payments account** is where outgoing payments are
  posted until they are linked with a withdrawal from your bank
  statement.
- An **outstanding receipts account** is where incoming payments are
  posted until they are linked with a deposit from your bank statement.

These accounts should be of
`type <chart-of-account/type>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
`Current Assets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Cash discounts and tax reduction

**Cash discounts** are reductions in the amount a customer must pay for
goods or services offered as an incentive for paying their invoice
promptly. These discounts are typically a percentage of the total
invoice amount and are applied if the customer pays within a specified
time. Cash discounts can help the company maintain a steady cash flow.

::: example
You issue a €100 invoice on the 1st of January. The full payment is due
within 30 days, and you also offer a 2% discount if your customer pays
you within seven days.

The customer can pay €98 up to the 8th of January. After that date, they
would have to pay €100 by the 31st of January.
:::

A `tax reduction <cash-discounts/tax-reductions>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} can also be applied depending on the country or region.

## Configuration {#cash-discounts/configuration}

To grant cash discounts to customers, you must first set up the
`type of tax reduction
<cash-discounts/tax-reductions>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, verify
the `gain and loss accounts
<cash-discounts/gain-loss-accounts>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
configure new `payment terms
<cash-discounts/payment-terms>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

### Tax reductions {#cash-discounts/tax-reductions}

Depending on the country or region, the base amount used to compute the
tax can vary, which can lead to a **tax reduction**.

To configure how the tax reduction is applied, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration
--> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and in the
`Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, in the
`Cash Discount Tax Reduction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
feature, select one of the three following options:

Always (upon invoice)

:   The tax is always reduced. The base amount used to compute the tax
    is the discounted amount, whether the customer benefits from the
    discount or not.

On early payment

:   The tax is reduced only if the customer pays early. The base amount
    used to compute the tax is the same as the sale: if the customer
    benefits from the reduction, then the tax is reduced. This means
    that, depending on the customer, the tax amount can vary after the
    invoice is issued.

Never

:   The tax is never reduced. The base amount used to compute the tax is
    the full amount, whether the customer benefits from the discount or
    not.

::::::: example
You issue a €100 invoice (tax-excluded) on the 1st of January, with a
21% tax rate. The full payment is due within 30 days, and you also offer
a 2% discount if your customer pays you within seven days.

`fiscal localization package <fiscal_localizations/packages>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

### Cash discount gain/loss accounts {#cash-discounts/gain-loss-accounts}

With a cash discount, the amount you earn depends on whether the
customer benefits from the cash discount or not. This inevitably leads
to gains and losses, which are recorded on default accounts.

To modify these accounts, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and in the `Default Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, select the accounts you want to use for the
`Cash Discount Gain account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Cash Discount Loss account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Payment terms {#cash-discounts/payment-terms}

Cash discounts are defined on
`payment terms <payment_terms>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. Configure
them to your liking by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and make sure to fill out the fields
`Discount %`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Discount Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Configuration of payment terms named \"2/7 Net 30\". The field \"Description on Invoices\"

## Apply a cash discount to a customer invoice {#cash-discounts/customer-invoice}

Apply a cash discount to a customer invoice by selecting the
`payment terms you created
<cash-discounts/payment-terms>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Odoo
automatically computes the correct amounts, tax amounts, due dates, and
accounting records.

Under the `Journal Items`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, you
can display the discount details by clicking on the \"toggle\" button
and adding the `Discount Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Discount Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns.

![An invoice of €100.00 with \"2/7 Net 30\" selected as payment terms. The \"Journal Items\" tab

The discount amount and due date are also displayed on the generated
invoice sent to the customer.

![An invoice of €100.00 with the following text added to the terms and conditions: \"30 Days,

### Payment reconciliation

When you record a payment or reconcile your bank statements, Odoo takes
the customer payment\'s date into account to define if they can benefit
from the cash discount or not.

:::: note

:::

If your customer pays the discount amount *after* the discount date, you
can always decide whether to mark the invoice as fully paid with a

# Cash rounding

**Cash rounding** is required when the lowest physical denomination of
currency, or the smallest coin, is higher than the minimum unit of
account.

For example, some countries require their companies to round up or down
the total amount of an invoice to the nearest five cents, when the
payment is made in cash.

## Configuration

Go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and enable *Cash Rounding*, then click on *Save*.

![image](cash_rounding/cash_rounding01.png){.align-center}

Go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Cash Roundings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click on *Create*.

Define here your *Rounding Precision*, *Rounding Strategy*, and
*Rounding Method*.

Odoo supports two **rounding strategies**:

1.  **Add a rounding line**: a *rounding* line is added on the invoice.
    You have to define which account records the cash roundings.
2.  **Modify tax amount**: the rounding is applied in the taxes section.

## Apply roundings

When editing a draft invoice, open the *Other Info* tab, go to the
*Accounting Information* section, and select the appropriate *Cash
Rounding Method*.




--- SOURCE: finance/accounting/customer_invoices/credit_notes.md ---

# Credit notes and refunds

A **credit/debit note**, or **credit/debit memo**, is a document issued
to a customer that notifies them that they have been *credited/debited*
a certain amount.

Several use cases can lead to a credit note, such as:

> - a mistake in the invoice
> - a return of the goods, or a rejection of the services
> - the goods delivered are damaged

Debit notes are less common but are most frequently used to track debts
owed by customers or to vendors because of modifications to confirmed
customer invoices or vendor bills.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Issuing a credit/debit note is the only legal way to cancel, refund, or
modify a validated invoice. Do not forget to **register the payment**
afterward if you need to send money back to your customer and/or
validate the
`return </applications/sales/sales/products_prices/returns>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} if a storable product is returned.
::::

## Issue a credit note

You can create a credit note from scratch by going to
`Accounting --> Customers -->
Credit Notes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and by clicking
on `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Filling out a credit
note form works the same way as an invoice form.

However, most of the time, credit notes are generated directly from the
related invoices. To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, open the related **customer invoice**, and click
on `Add Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

You can choose between three options:

> - `Partial Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
> - `Full Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
> - `Full refund and new draft invoice`{.interpreted-text
>   role="guilabel"}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

A credit note sequence starts with [R]{.title-ref} and is followed by
the number of the related document (e.g., RINV/2019/0004 is related to
the invoice INV/2019/0004).
::::

### Partial refund

When selecting the `Partial Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option, Odoo creates a draft credit note already prefilled with all the
necessary information from the original invoice. This is the option to
choose if you wish to do a partial refund or if you want to modify any
detail of the credit note.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This is the only option for invoices marked as *in payment* or *paid*.
::::

### Full refund

When selecting the `Full Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option, Odoo creates a credit note, automatically validates it, and
reconciles it with the related invoice.

![Full refund credit note.](credit_notes/credit_notes02.png)

This is the option to choose for a full refund or to **cancel** a
*validated* invoice.

### Full refund and new draft invoice

When selecting the `Full refund and new draft invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option, Odoo creates a credit note, automatically
validates it, reconciles it with the related invoice, and opens a new
draft invoice prefilled with the same details from the original invoice.

This is the option to **modify** the content of a *validated* invoice.

## Issue a debit note

You can create a debit note from scratch by going to
`Accounting --> Customers -->
Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} or by clicking on the
related invoice you wish to issue a debit note for. On the invoice form
view, click `Add debit note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, fill in
the information, and click `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Record a vendor refund

**Vendor refunds** are recorded the same way as credit notes:

You can either create a credit note from scratch by going to
`Accounting --> Vendors
--> Refund`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and by clicking on
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}; or by opening the related
**vendor bill**, and clicking on `Add Credit Note`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

## Record a debit note

**Debit notes** from vendors are recorded in a similar way to how they
are issued to customers:

Go to `Accounting --> Vendors --> Bills`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, open the related bill you wish to record a debit
note for, and click `Add debit note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Fill in the information, and click `Create debit note`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

## Journal entries

Issuing a credit/debit note from an invoice/bill creates a **reverse
entry** that zeroes out the journal items generated by the original
invoice.

::: example
The journal invoice of an entry:

![Invoice journal entry.](credit_notes/credit_notes03.png)

And here is the credit note's journal entry generated to reverse the
original invoice above:

# Delivery and invoice addresses

Companies often have multiple locations, and it is common that a
customer invoice should be sent to one address and the delivery should
be sent to another. Odoo\'s **Customer Addresses** feature is designed
to handle this scenario by making it easy to specify which address to
use for each case.

::: seealso
`overview`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Configuration

To specify a sales order\'s invoice and delivery addresses, first go to
`Accounting
--> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
In the `Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
enable `Customer Addresses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

On quotations and sales orders, there are now fields for
`Invoice Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Delivery Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If the customer
has an invoice or delivery address listed on their contact record, the
corresponding field will use that address by default, but any contact\'s
address can be used instead.

## Invoice and deliver to different addresses

Delivery orders and their delivery slip reports use the address set as
the `Delivery
Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the sales order. By
default, invoice reports show both the shipping address and the invoice
address to assure the customer that the delivery is going to the correct
location.

Emails also go to different addresses. The quotation and sales order are
sent to the main contact\'s email, as usual, but the invoice is sent to
the email of the address set as the `Invoice Address`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the sales order.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Reports, such as the delivery slip and invoice report, can be
`customized using Studio
</applications/studio/pdf_reports>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. - If
`Send by Post <snailmail>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} is checked when
you click `Send & Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the invoice
will be mailed to the invoice address.

# Deferred revenues

**Deferred revenues**, or **unearned revenue**, are payments made in
advance by customers for products yet to deliver or services yet to
render.

Such payments are a **liability** for the company that receives them
since it still owes its customers these products or services. The
company cannot report them on the current **Profit and Loss statement**,
or *Income Statement*, since the payments will be effectively earned in
the future.

These future revenues must be deferred on the company\'s balance sheet
until the moment in time they can be **recognized**, at once or over a
defined period, on the Profit and Loss statement.

For example, let\'s say we sell a five-year extended warranty for \$
350. We already receive the money now but haven\'t earned it yet.
Therefore, we post this new income in a deferred revenue account and
decide to recognize it on a yearly basis. Each year, for the next 5
years, \$ 70 will be recognized as revenue.

Odoo Accounting handles deferred revenues by spreading them in multiple
entries that are automatically created in *draft mode* and then posted
periodically.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The server checks once a day if an entry must be posted. It might then
take up to 24 hours before you see a change from *draft* to *posted*.
::::

## Prerequisites

Such transactions must be posted on a **Deferred Revenue Account**
rather than on the default income account.

### Configure a Deferred Revenue Account

To configure your account in the **Chart of Accounts**, go to
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click on *Create*, and fill out the form.

![Configuration of a Deferred Revenue Account in Odoo Accounting](deferred_revenues/deferred_revenues01.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This account\'s type must be either *Current Liabilities* or
*Non-current Liabilities*
::::

### Post an income to the right account

#### Select the account on a draft invoice

On a draft invoice, select the right account for all the products of
which the incomes must be deferred.

![Selection of a Deferred Revenue Account on a draft invoice in Odoo Accounting](deferred_revenues/deferred_revenues02.png){.align-center}

#### Choose a different Income Account for specific products

Start editing the product, go to the *Accounting* tab, select the right
**Income Account**, and save.

![Change of the Income Account for a product in Odoo](deferred_revenues/deferred_revenues03.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

It is possible to automate the creation of revenue entries for these
products (see: [Automate the Deferred
Revenues](#automate-the-deferred-revenues)).
::::

#### Change the account of a posted journal item

To do so, open your Sales Journal by going to
`Accounting --> Accounting --> Sales`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select the journal item you want to modify, click
on the account, and select the right one.

![Modification of a posted journal item\'s account in Odoo Accounting](deferred_revenues/deferred_revenues04.png){.align-center}

## Deferred Revenues entries

### Create a new entry

A **Deferred Revenues entry** automatically generates all journal
entries in *draft mode*. They are then posted one by one at the right
time until the full amount of the income is recognized.

To create a new entry, go to
`Accounting --> Accounting --> Deferred Revenues`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click on *Create*, and fill out the form.

Click on **select related purchases** to link an existing journal item
to this new entry. Some fields are then automatically filled out, and
the journal item is now listed under the **Related Sales** tab.

![Deferred Revenue entry in Odoo Accounting](deferred_revenues/deferred_revenues05.png){.align-center}

Once done, you can click on *Compute Revenue* (next to the *Confirm*
button) to generate all the values of the **Revenue Board**. This board
shows you all the entries that Odoo will post to recognize your revenue,
and at which date.

![Revenue Board in Odoo Accounting](deferred_revenues/deferred_revenues06.png){.align-center}

#### What does \"Prorata Temporis\" mean?

The **Prorata Temporis** feature is useful to recognize your revenue the
most accurately possible.

With this feature, the first entry on the Revenue Board is computed
based on the time left between the *Prorata Date* and the *First
Recognition Date* rather than the default amount of time between
recognitions.

For example, the Revenue Board above has its first revenue with an
amount of \$ 4.22 rather than \$ 70.00. Consequently, the last entry is
also lower and has an amount of \$ 65.78.

### Deferred Entry from the Sales Journal

You can create a deferred entry from a specific journal item in your
**Sales Journal**.

To do so, open your Sales Journal by going to
`Accounting --> Accounting --> Sales`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the journal item you want to defer.
Make sure that it is posted in the right account (see: [Change the
account of a posted journal
item](#change-the-account-of-a-posted-journal-item)).

Then, click on *Action*, select **Create Deferred Entry**, and fill out
the form the same way you would do to [create a new
entry](#create-a-new-entry).

![Create Deferred Entry from a journal item in Odoo Accounting](deferred_revenues/deferred_revenues07.png){.align-center}

## Deferred Revenue Models

You can create **Deferred Revenue Models** to create your Deferred
Revenue entries faster.

To create a model, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Deferred Revenue Models`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click on *Create*, and fill out the form the same
way you would do to create a new entry.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can also convert a *confirmed Deferred Revenue entry* into a model
by opening it from `Accounting --> Accounting --> Deferred
Revenues`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and then, by clicking
on the button *Save Model*.
::::

### Apply a Deferred Revenue Model to a new entry

When you create a new Deferred Revenue entry, fill out the **Deferred
Revenue Account** with the right recognition account.

New buttons with all the models linked to that account appear at the top
of the form. Clicking on a model button fills out the form according to
that model.

![Deferred Revenue model button in Odoo Accounting](deferred_revenues/deferred_revenues08.png){.align-center}

## Automate the Deferred Revenues {#deferred-revenues-automation}

When you create or edit an account of which the type is either *Current
Liabilities* or *Non-current Liabilities*, you can configure it to defer
the revenues that are credited on it automatically.

You have three choices for the **Automate Deferred Revenue** field:

1.  **No:** this is the default value. Nothing happens.
2.  **Create in draft:** whenever a transaction is posted on the
    account, a draft *Deferred Revenues entry* is created, but not
    validated. You must first fill out the form in
    `Accounting --> Accounting --> Deferred Revenues`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
3.  **Create and validate:** you must also select a Deferred Revenue
    Model (see: [Deferred Revenue Models](#deferred-revenue-models)).
    Whenever a transaction is posted on the account, a *Deferred
    Revenues entry* is created and immediately validated.

![Automate Deferred Revenue on an account in Odoo Accounting](deferred_revenues/deferred_revenues09.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can, for example, select this account as the default **Income
Account** of a product to fully automate its sale. (see: [Choose a
different Income Account for specific
products](#choose-a-different-income-account-for-specific-products)).

# Electronic invoicing (`EDI (electronic data interchange)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"})

EDI, or electronic data interchange, is the inter-company communication
of business documents, such as purchase orders and invoices, in a
standard format. Sending documents according to an EDI standard ensures
that the machine receiving the message can interpret the information
correctly. Various EDI file formats exist and are available depending on
your company\'s country.

EDI feature enables automating the administration between companies and
might also be required by some governments for fiscal control or to
facilitate the administration.

Electronic invoicing of your documents such as customer invoices, credit
notes or vendor bills is one of the application of EDI.

Odoo supports, among others, the following formats.

  Format Name                                    Applicability
  ---------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Factur-X (PDF/A-3)                             For French and German companies
  Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 (UBL BIS Billing 3.0)   For companies whose countries are part of the [EAS list](https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/codelist/eas/)
  E-FFF                                          For Belgian companies
  XRechnung (UBL)                                For German companies
  Fattura PA (IT)                                For Italian companies
  CFDI (4.0)                                     For Mexican companies
  Peru UBL 2.1                                   For Peruvian companies
  SII IVA Llevanza de libros registro (ES)       For Spanish companies

  A-NZ BIS Billing 3.0                           For Australian/New Zealand companies
  Peppol                                         For `Peppol<e-invoicing/peppol>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

::: seealso
`fiscal_localizations/packages`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
:::

## Configuration {#e-invoicing/configuration}

Go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals --> Customer Invoices --> Advanced
Settings --> Electronic Invoicing`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and enable the formats you need for this journal.

![Select the EDI format you need](electronic_invoicing/formats.png){.align-center}

Once an electronic invoicing format is enabled, XML documents are
generated when clicking on `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
in documents such as invoices, credit notes, etc. These documents are
either visible in the attachment section, or embedded in the PDF.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- For E-FFF, the xml file only appears after having generated the PDF
(`Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Send & Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button), since the PDF
needs to be embedded inside the xml. - Every PDF generated from Odoo
contains a `Factur-X`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} XML file (for
interoperability purpose). For German and French companies, the option
`Factur-X (PDF/A-3)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in addition
enables validation checks on the invoice and generates a PDF/A-3
compliant file, required by plaftorms like Chorus Pro. - The formats
available depend on the country registered in your company\'s `General
Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. - Odoo supports the
**Peppol BIS Billing 3.0** format that can be used via existing access
points.
::::

## Peppol {#e-invoicing/peppol}

The [Peppol](https://peppol.org/about/) network ensures the exchange of
documents and information between companies and governmental
authorities. It is primarily used for electronic invoicing, and its
access points (connectors to the Peppol network) allow companies to send
electronic documents such as customer invoices and credit notes and
receive documents like vendor bills and refunds.

In this case, Odoo acts as both an **access point** and an
`SMP (Service Metadata Publisher)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
enables electronic invoicing transactions without the need to send
invoices or bills by email or post.

:::: note

### Registration {#e-invoicing/peppol-registration}

To register on Peppol, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, scroll to the
`PEPPOL Electronic Document Invoicing`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, and fill in the following information:

- `Peppol EAS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Peppol Electronic
  Address Scheme, which usually depends on the company\'s country. This
  field is often prefilled with your country\'s most commonly used EAS
  code. For example, the preferred EAS code for most companies in
  Belgium is [0208]{.title-ref}.

- `Peppol Endpoint`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: usually a
  Company Registry number or a VAT number

- `Mobile Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, including the
  country code (e.g., [+32]{.title-ref} in Belgium)

- `Primary contact email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

  > :::

1.  Click `Validate registration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
2.  The registration should be automatically activated, and the
    `Application status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should be
    updated within a day.
3.  Select another purchase journal in the
    `Incoming Invoices Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
    if necessary.

All invoices can then be sent directly using Peppol.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- To update the `Primary contact email`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, modify it and click `Update contact
details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. - If you are using an
access point from a previous provider, make sure to deregister from it
first, then register with your new access point, unless it\'s Hermes
(BOSA). If using Hermes (BOSA), no action is needed; the migration is
handled automatically.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- To manually trigger the scheduled action used to check the Peppol
registration status, enable
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, open
the Settings app, go to `Settings
--> Technical --> Scheduled actions`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and search for `Peppol: update participant
status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Open the scheduled action,
then click `Run Manually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. - To try
Peppol without sending real data, use the demo mode by setting the
`account_edi_proxy_client.demo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
system parameter to [demo]{.title-ref}. This has to be done before
clicking `Validate registration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. -
For advanced testing on Peppol\'s dedicated test network, use the test
mode by setting the `account_edi_proxy_client.demo`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} system parameter to [test]{.title-ref}. This option is
intended for experienced users only. This has to be done before clicking
`Validate registration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

### Contact verification {#e-invoicing/contact-verification}

Before sending an invoice to a contact using Peppol, make sure the
contact is registered as a Peppol participant. To do so, follow these
steps:

1.  Go to `Accounting --> Customers --> Customers`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and access the customer\'s form.
2.  In the `Accounting tab`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, check
    the following information in the `Electronic
    Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section:
    - `Format`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
      `BIS Billing 3.0`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
      `XRechnung CIUS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
      `NLCIUS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
    - `Peppol e-address (EAS)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
      Select the relevant EAS code in the dropdown list.
    - `Peppol Endpoint`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
      customer\'s endpoint identifier.
3.  Click `Verify`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Its
    `Peppol endpoint validity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
    marked as `Valid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if the contact
    is found on the Peppol network.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

While Odoo prefills both the EAS code and the endpoint number based on
the information available for a contact, verifying these details with
the contact is recommended.
::::

### Send invoices {#e-invoicing/send-invoices}

To generate Peppol documents for invoices of a journal
`enable the EDI format called 'Peppol' on the journal<e-invoicing/configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. This should have happened automatically for countries in
which Peppol is used by installing the module. Then confirming an
invoice will generate Peppol a document in the format selected on the
partner during the
`contact verification<e-invoicing/contact-verification>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Posted invoices to be sent via Peppol are marked as
`Ready to send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the invoice\'s
`PEPPOL status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

All invoices that are ready to be sent via Peppol can be viewed in the
following ways:

- In the `Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list view, use
  the `oi-settings-adjust`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} (`adjust
  settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) button to add the
  `PEPPOL status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column or apply the
  `Peppol
  Ready`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter in the search bar.
- In the Accounting dashboard, click
  `Peppol ready invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
  relevant sales journal.
::::

To send the invoice to the customer via Peppol, click
`Send & Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the confirmed
invoice form. In the `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window,
enable `Send via PEPPOL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options,
then click `Send & Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (or
`Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Send (Peppol)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} depending on which of the
`Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `Email`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} options are selected).

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Multiple invoices can also be sent in batches via Peppol by using the
`Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list view.
::::

Once the invoices are sent via Peppol, their
`PEPPOL status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is changed to
`Processing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The status is updated to `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} once
the invoices have been successfully delivered to the contact\'s access
point.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To manually trigger the scheduled action used to check the invoices\'
status, go to the Accounting dashboard and click
`Fetch Peppol invoice status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
corresponding sales journal.
::::

### Receive vendor bills {#e-invoicing/receive-vendor-bills}

New documents received via Peppol are checked multiple times a day.
Received documents are automatically imported into the purchase journal
set in the `PEPPOL Electronic Document
Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and corresponding
vendor bills are created as drafts and appear in the vendor bills list
view.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To manually trigger the scheduled action to retrieve incoming Peppol
documents, go to the Accounting dashboard and click
`Fetch from Peppol`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the main
Peppol purchase journal.
::::

### Peppol deregistration from Odoo {#e-invoicing/peppol-deregister}

Only one Peppol receiver registration can be active for each Peppol
endpoint identifier at a time. To stop using Odoo as the Peppol access
point, e.g., to switch to another provider or reconfigure the
registration for a new database, you must first deregister from Peppol.
To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, scroll down to the `PEPPOL
Electronic Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, and
click `Deregister from Peppol`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Once removed, the Peppol registration is deleted from the database, and
documents can no longer be sent or received via Peppol in Odoo.

# EPC QR codes

European Payments Council quick response codes, or **EPC QR codes**, are
two-dimensional barcodes that customers can scan with their **mobile
banking applications** to initiate a **SEPA credit transfer (SCT)** and
pay their invoices instantly.

In addition to bringing ease of use and speed, it greatly reduces typing
errors that would potentially make for payment issues.

# Incoterms

`Incoterms (International Commercial Terms)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} are standardized trade terms used in international
transactions to define the rights and responsibilities of buyers and
sellers. They establish the obligations related to the delivery of
goods, the transfer of risks, and the distribution of costs between the
parties involved. Incoterms specify important details, such as the point
at which the risk and costs transfer from the seller to the buyer, the
responsibility for transportation, insurance, customs clearance, and
other relevant aspects of the transaction.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

By default, all 11 Incoterms are available in Odoo:

- **EXW**: Ex works
- **FCA**: Free carrier
- **FAS**: Free alongside ship
- **FOB**: Free on board
- **CFR**: Cost and freight
- **CIF**: Cost, insurance and freight
- **CPT**: Carriage paid to
- **CIP**: Carriage and insurance paid to
- **DPU**: Delivered at place unloaded
- **DAP**: Delivered at place
- **DDP**: Delivered duty paid

# Invoicing processes

Depending on your business and the application you use, there are
different ways to automate the customer invoice creation in Odoo.
Usually, draft invoices are created by the system (with information
coming from other documents like sales order or contracts) and
accountant just have to validate draft invoices and send the invoices in
batch (by regular mail or email).

Depending on your business, you may opt for one of the following way to
create draft invoices:

## Sales

### Sales Order ‣ Invoice

In most companies, salespeople create quotations that become sales order
once they are validated. Then, draft invoices are created based on the
sales order. You have different options like:

- Invoice manually: use a button on the sale order to trigger the draft
  invoice
- Invoice before delivery: invoice the full order before triggering the
  delivery order
- Invoice based on delivery order: see next section

Invoice before delivery is usually used by the eCommerce application
when the customer pays at the order and we deliver afterwards.
(pre-paid)

For most other use cases, it\'s recommended to invoice manually. It
allows the salesperson to trigger the invoice on demand with options:
invoice the whole order, invoice a percentage (advance), invoice some
lines, invoice a fixed advance.

This process is good for both services and physical products.

::: seealso
\- `/applications/sales/sales/invoicing/proforma`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

### Sales Order ‣ Delivery Order ‣ Invoice

Retailers and eCommerce usually invoice based on delivery orders,
instead of sales order. This approach is suitable for businesses where
the quantities you deliver may differs from the ordered quantities:
foods (invoice based on actual Kg).

This way, if you deliver a partial order, you only invoice for what you
really delivered. If you do back orders (deliver partially and the rest
later), the customer will receive two invoices, one for each delivery
order.

::: seealso
\-
`/applications/sales/sales/invoicing/invoicing_policy`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

### eCommerce Order ‣ Invoice

An eCommerce order will also trigger the creation of the order when it
is fully paid. If you allow paying orders by check or wire transfer,
Odoo only creates an order and the invoice will be triggered once the
payment is received.

## Contracts

### Regular Contracts ‣ Invoices

If you use contracts, you can trigger invoice based on time and material
spent, expenses or fixed lines of services/products. Every month, the
salesperson will trigger invoice based on activities on the contract.

Activities can be:

- fixed products/services, coming from a sale order linked to this
  contract
- materials purchased (that you will re-invoice)
- time and material based on timesheets or purchases (subcontracting)
- expenses like travel and accommodation that you re-invoice to the
  customer

You can invoice at the end of the contract or trigger intermediate
invoices. This approach is used by services companies that invoice
mostly based on time and material. For services companies that invoice
on fix price, they use a regular sales order.

`/applications/sales/sales/invoicing/time_materials`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} -
`/applications/sales/sales/invoicing/expense`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} -
`/applications/sales/sales/invoicing/milestone`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

### Recurring Contracts ‣ Invoices

For subscriptions, an invoice is triggered periodically, automatically.
The frequency of the invoicing and the services/products invoiced are
defined on the contract.

::: seealso
\- `/applications/sales/subscriptions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Others

### Creating an invoice manually

Users can also create invoices manually without using contracts or a
sales order. It\'s a recommended approach if you do not need to manage
the sales process (quotations), or the delivery of the products or
services.

Even if you generate the invoice from a sales order, you may need to
create invoices manually in exceptional use cases:

- if you need to create a refund
- If you need to give a discount
- if you need to change an invoice created from a sales order
- if you need to invoice something not related to your core business

### Specific modules

Some specific modules are also able to generate draft invoices:

- **membership**: invoice your members every year
- **repairs**: invoice your after-sale services

### Resequencing of the invoices

It remains possible to resequence the invoices but with some
restrictions:

1.  The feature does not work when entries are previous to a lock date.
2.  The feature does not work if the sequence is inconsistent with the
    month of the entry.
3.  It does not work if the sequence leads to a duplicate.
4.  The order of the invoice remains unchanged.
5.  It is useful for people who use a numbering from another software
    and who want to continue the current year without starting over from
    the beginning.

### Invoice digitization with optical character recognition (OCR)

**Invoice digitization** is the process of automatically encoding
traditional paper invoices into invoices forms in your accounting.

Odoo uses OCR and artificial intelligence technologies to recognize the
content of the documents. Vendor bills and customer invoices forms are
automatically created and populated based on scanned invoices.

# Payment terms and installment plans

**Payment terms** specify all the conditions of a sale\'s payment to
help ensure customers pay their invoices correctly and on time.

Payment terms are generally defined on documents such as sales orders,
customer invoices, and vendor bills. Payment terms cover:

- The due date(s)
- Early payment discounts
- Any other conditions on the payment

An **installment plan** allows the customers to pay an invoice in parts,
with the amounts and payment dates defined beforehand by the seller.

::: example
Immediate Payment The full payment is due on the day of the invoice\'s
issuance. 15 Days (or Net 15) The full payment is due 15 days after the
invoice date. 21 MFI The full payment is due by the 21st of the month
following the invoice date. 30% Advance End of Following Month 30% is
due on the day of the invoice\'s issuance. The remaining balance is due
at the end of the following month. 2% 10, Net 30 EOM A 2%
`cash discount <cash_discounts>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} if the
payment is received within ten days. Otherwise, the full payment is due
at the end of the month following the invoice date.
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Payment terms are not to be confused with `down payment invoices
</applications/sales/sales/invoicing/down_payment>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. If, for a specific order, you issue multiple invoices to
your customer, that is neither a payment term nor an installment plan
but an invoicing policy. - This page is about the *payment terms*
feature, not `terms & conditions
<terms_conditions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, which can be used to
declare contractual obligations regarding content use, return policies,
and other policies surrounding the sale of goods and services.

:::

## Configuration

To create new payment terms, follow these steps:

1.  Go to
    `Accounting --> Configuration --> Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and click on `New`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

2.  Enter a name in the `Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field. This field is the name displayed in the
    database and is not customer-facing.

3.  Enter the text to be displayed on the document (sales order,
    invoice, etc.) in the `Description on the Invoice`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field.

4.  Tick the `Display terms on invoice`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} checkbox to display a breakdown of each payment and
    its due date on the invoice report, if desired.

5.  In the `Terms`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, add a set
    of rules (terms) to define what needs to be paid and by which due
    date(s). Defining terms automatically calculates the payments\' due
    date(s). This is particularly helpful for managing **installment
    plans** (`payment terms with multiple
    terms`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}).

    To add a term, click on `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, define its `Due Type`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} and `Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
    fill out the appropriate fields to define when the term is due,
    including any `discounts <cash_discounts>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}. Due dates are calculated by taking the invoice/bill
    date, first adding the `Months`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    and then adding the `Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If
    the `End
    of month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} toggle is enabled, the
    due date will then be the end of that month, plus any
    `Days after End of month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To instead specify a number of days *before the end of the month*, use a
negative value in the `Days after End of month`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.
::::

To test that your payment terms are configured correctly, enter an
invoice amount and invoice date in the `Example`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section to generate the payments that would be due and
their due dates using these payment terms.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

\- Terms are computed in the order of their due dates. - The **balance**
should always be used for the last line.
::::

::: example
In the following example, 30% is due on the day of issuance, and the
balance is due at the end of the following month.

![Example of Payment Terms. The last line is the balance due on the 31st of the following
month.](payment_terms/configuration.png)
:::

## Using payment terms

Payment terms can be defined using the `Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field on:

- **Contacts:** To automatically set default payment terms on a
  contact\'s new sales orders, invoices, and bills. This can be modified
  in the contact form, under the `Sales &
  Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
- **Quotations/Sales Orders:** To set specific payment terms
  automatically on all invoices generated from a quotation or sales
  order.

Payment terms can be defined using the `Due Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, with the `Terms`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down list on:

- **Customer invoices:** To set specific payment terms on an invoice.
- **Vendor bills:** To set specific payment terms on a bill.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Setting payment terms on a vendor bill is mostly useful for managing
vendor terms with multiple installments or cash discounts. Otherwise,
manually setting the **due date** is enough. If payment terms are
already defined, empty the field to select a date.
::::

## Journal entries

Invoices with specific payment terms generate different *journal
entries*, with one *journal item* for every computed *due date*.

This makes for easier
`follow-ups </applications/finance/accounting/payments/follow_up>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and
`reconciliation </applications/finance/accounting/bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} since Odoo takes each due date into account, rather than
just the balance due date. It also helps to get an accurate
`aged receivable report <customer-invoices/aging-report>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

::: {.example alt="The amount debited to the account receivable is split into two journal items with
distinct due dates

In this example, an invoice of $1000 has been issued with the following payment terms: *30% is
due on the day of issuance, and the balance is due at the end of the following month.*

+----------------------+-------------+---------+---------+
| Account              | Due date    | Debit   | Credit  |
+======================+=============+=========+=========+
| Account Receivable   | February 21 | 300     |         |
+----------------------+-------------+---------+---------+
| Account Receivable   | March 31    | 700     |         |
+----------------------+-------------+---------+---------+
| Product Sales        |             |         | 1000    |
+----------------------+-------------+---------+---------+

The $1000 debited to the account receivable is split into two distinct journal items. Both of
them have their own due date."}

# Snailmail {#customer_invoices/snailmail}

Sending direct mail can be an effective strategy for grabbing people\'s
attention, especially when their email inboxes are overflowing. With
Odoo, you have the ability to send invoices and follow-up reports
through postal mail worldwide, all from within your database.

## Configuration

Go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Customer invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} section to activate `Snailmail`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

To make it a by-default feature, select `Send by Post`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `Default Sending
Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

![Under settings enable the snailmail feature in Odoo Accounting](snailmail/setup-snailmail.png){.align-center}

## Send invoices by post

Open your invoice, click on `Send & Print`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and select `Send by Post`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Make sure your customer's address is set correctly,
including the country, before sending the letter.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Your document must respect the following rules to pass the validation
before being sent:

- Margins must be **5 mm** on all sides. As Odoo forces the outer
  margins by filling them with white before sending the snailmail, it
  can results in the user\'s custom being cut off if it protrudes into
  the margins. To check the margins, activate the `developer mode
  <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, go to
  `General Settings --> Technical --> Reporting
  section: Paper Format`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
- A square of **15mm by 15mm** on the bottom left corner has to stay
  clear.
- The postage area has to stay clear
  (`download the snailmail PDF template
  <snailmail/snailmail-template.pdf>`{.interpreted-text role="download"}
  for more details).
- Pingen (Odoo Snailmail service provider) scans the area to process the
  address, so if something gets written outside the area, it is not
  counted as part of the address.
::::

## Pricing

Snailmail is an
`/applications/essentials/in_app_purchase`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
service that requires prepaid stamps (=credits) to work. Sending one
document consumes one stamp.

To buy stamps, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Customer

# Customer invoices

## From Customer Invoice to Payments Collection

Odoo supports multiple invoicing and payment workflows, so you can
choose and use the ones that match your business needs. Whether you want
to accept a single payment for a single invoice, or process a payment
spanning multiple invoices and taking discounts for early payments, you
can do so efficiently and accurately.

### From Draft Invoice to Profit and Loss

If we pick up at the end of a typical \'order to cash\' scenario, after
the goods have been shipped, you will: issue an invoice; receive
payment; deposit that payment at the bank; make sure the Customer
Invoice is closed; follow up if Customers are late; and finally present
your Income on the Profit and Loss report and show the decrease in
Assets on the Balance Sheet report.

Invoicing in most countries occurs when a contractual obligation is met.
If you ship a box to a customer, you have met the terms of the contract
and can bill them. If your supplier sends you a shipment, they have met
the terms of that contract and can bill you. Therefore, the terms of the
contract is fulfilled when the box moves to or from the truck. At this
point, Odoo supports the creation of what is called a Draft Invoice by
Warehouse staff.

### Invoice creation

Draft invoices can be manually generated from other documents such as
Sales Orders, Purchase Orders,etc. Although you can create a draft
invoice directly if you would like.

An invoice must be provided to the customer with the necessary
information in order for them to pay for the goods and services ordered
and delivered. It must also include other information needed to pay the
invoice in a timely and precise manner.

### Draft invoices

The system generates invoice which are initially set to the Draft state.
While these invoices remain unvalidated, they have no accounting impact
within the system. There is nothing to stop users from creating their
own draft invoices.

Let\'s create a customer invoice with following information:

- Customer: Agrolait
- Product: iMac
- Quantity: 1
- Unit Price: 100
- Taxes: Tax 15%

![image](customer_invoices/invoice01.png)

![image](customer_invoices/invoice02.png)

The document is composed of three parts:

- the top of the invoice, with customer information,
- the main body of the invoice, with detailed invoice lines,
- the bottom of the page, with detail about the taxes, and the totals.

### Open or Pro-forma invoices

An invoice will usually include the quantity and the price of goods
and/or services, the date, any parties involved, the unique invoice
number, and any tax information.

\"Validate\" the invoice when you are ready to approve it. The invoice
then moves from the Draft state to the Open state.

When you have validated an invoice, Odoo gives it a unique number from a
defined, and modifiable, sequence.

![image](customer_invoices/invoice03.png)

Accounting entries corresponding to this invoice are automatically
generated when you validate the invoice. You can see the details by
clicking on the entry in the Journal Entry field in the \"Other Info\"
tab.

![image](customer_invoices/invoice04.png)

### Send the invoice to customer

After validating the customer invoice, you can directly send it to the
customer via the \'Send by email\' functionality.

![image](customer_invoices/invoice05.png)

A typical journal entry generated from a validated invoice will look
like as follows:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Account**         **Partner**   **Due date**  **Debit**   **Credit**
  ------------------- ------------- ------------- ----------- ------------
  Accounts Receivable Agrolait      01/07/2015    115         

  Taxes               Agrolait                                15

  Sales                                                       100
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Payment

In Odoo, an invoice is considered to be paid when the associated
accounting entry has been reconciled with the payment entries. If there
has not been a reconciliation, the invoice will remain in the Open state
until you have entered the payment.

A typical journal entry generated from a payment will look like as
follows:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Account**         **Partner**   **Due date**  **Debit**   **Credit**
  ------------------- ------------- ------------- ----------- ------------
  Bank                Agrolait                    115         

  Accounts Receivable Agrolait                                115
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Receive a partial payment through the bank statement

You can manually enter your bank statements in Odoo, or you can import
them in from a csv file or from several other predefined formats
according to your accounting localisation.

Create a bank statement from the accounting dashboard with the related
journal and enter an amount of \$100 .

![image](customer_invoices/invoice06.png)

### Reconcile

Now let\'s reconcile!

![image](customer_invoices/invoice07.png)

You can now go through every transaction and reconcile them or you can
mass reconcile with instructions at the bottom.

After reconciling the items in the sheet, the related invoice will now
display \"You have outstanding payments for this customer. You can
reconcile them to pay this invoice. \"

![image](customer_invoices/invoice08.png)

![image](customer_invoices/invoice09.png)

Apply the payment. Below, you can see that the payment has been added to
the invoice.

![image](customer_invoices/invoice10.png)

### Payment Followup

There\'s a growing trend of customers paying bills later and later.
Therefore, collectors must make every effort to collect money and
collect it faster.

Odoo will help you define your follow-up strategy. To remind customers
to pay their outstanding invoices, you can define different actions
depending on how severely overdue the customer is. These actions are
bundled into follow-up levels that are triggered when the due date of an
invoice has passed a certain number of days. If there are other overdue
invoices for the same customer, the actions of the most overdue invoice
will be executed.

By going to the customer record and diving into the \"Overdue Payments\"
you will see the follow-up message and all overdue invoices.

![image](customer_invoices/invoice11.png)

![image](customer_invoices/invoice12.png)

#### Customer aging report: {#customer-invoices/aging-report}

The customer aging report will be an additional key tool for the
collector to understand the customer credit issues, and to prioritize
their work.

Use the aging report to determine which customers are overdue and begin
your collection efforts.

![image](customer_invoices/invoice13.png)

### Profit and loss

The Profit and Loss statement displays your revenue and expense details.
Ultimately, this gives you a clear image of your Net Profit and Loss. It
is sometimes referred to as the \"Income Statement\" or \"Statement of
Revenues and Expenses.\"

![image](customer_invoices/invoice14.png)

### Balance sheet

The balance sheet summarizes your company\'s liabilities, assets and
equity at a specific moment in time.

![image](customer_invoices/invoice15.png)

![image](customer_invoices/invoice16.png)

For example, if you manage your inventory using the perpetual accounting
method, you should expect a decrease in account \"Current Assets\" once
the material has been shipped to the customer.

# Average price on returned goods

::: {#inventory/avg_cost/definition}
*Average cost valuation* (AVCO) is an inventory valuation method that
evaluates cost based on the total cost of goods bought or produced
during a period, divided by the total number of items on-hand. Inventory
valuation is used to:
:::

- reflect the value of a company\'s assets;
- keep track of the amount of unsold goods;
- account for monetary value in goods that have yet to generate profit;
- report on flow of goods throughout the quarter.

Because `AVCO (Average Cost Valuation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
uses the weighted average to evaluate the cost, it is a good fit for
companies that sell only a few different products in large quantities.
In Odoo, this costing analysis is *automatically updated* each time
products are received.

Thus, when shipments are returned to their supplier, Odoo automatically
generates accounting entries to reflect the change in inventory
valuation. However, Odoo does **not** automatically update the
`AVCO (Average Cost Valuation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
calculation, because
`this can potentially create inconsistencies with inventory
valuation <inventory/avg_price/leaving_inventory>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title

:::

This document addresses a specific use case for theoretical purposes.
For instructions on how to set up and use
`AVCO (Average Cost Valuation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, refer to

## Configuration

To use average cost inventory valuation on a product, navigate to
`Inventory -->
Configuration --> Product Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select the category that will be using
`AVCO (Average Cost Valuation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. On the
product category page, set `Costing Method`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to [Average Cost (AVCO)]{.title-ref} and
`Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
[Automated]{.title-ref}.

## Using average cost valuation

The average cost method adjusts the inventory valuation when products
are received in the warehouse. This section explains how it works, but
if the explanation is unnecessary, skip to the `return
to supplier use case <inventory/avg_cost/return>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} section.

### Formula {#inventory/avg_cost/formula}

When new products arrive, the new average cost for each product is
recomputed using the formula:

$$Avg~Cost = \frac{(Old~Qty \times Old~Avg~Cost) + (Incoming~Qty \times Purchase~Price)}{Final~Qty}$$

- **Old Qty**: product count in stock before receiving the new shipment;
- **Old Avg Cost**: calculated average cost for a single product from
  the previous inventory valuation;
- **Incoming Qty**: count of products arriving in the new shipment;
- **Purchase Price**: estimated price of products at the reception of
  products (since vendor bills may arrive later). The amount includes
  not only the price for the products, but also added costs, such as
  shipping, taxes, and
  `landed costs <inventory/reporting/landed_costs>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}. At reception of the vendor bill, this price is adjusted;
- **Final Qty**: quantity of on-hand stock after the stock move.

When products leave the warehouse, the average cost **does not** change.

### Compute average cost {#inventory/avg_cost/math_table}

To understand how the average cost of a product changes with each
shipment, consider the following table of warehouse operations and stock
moves. Each is a different example of how the average cost valuation is
affected.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Operation               Incoming    Inventory      Qty On Hand Avg Cost
                          Value       Value

  Receive 4 tables at     4 \* \$16   \$144          12          \$12
  \$16/unit                                                      

  Deliver 10 tables       -10 \* \$12 \$24           2           \$12
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

:::: {#inventory/avg_cost/ex-1}
::: exercise
Ensure comprehension of the above computations by reviewing the
\"Receive 8 tables at \$10/unit\" example.

Initially, the product stock is 0, so all values are \$0.

In the first warehouse operation, [8]{.title-ref} tables are received at
[\$10]{.title-ref} each. The average cost is calculated using the
`formula <inventory/avg_cost/formula>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:

$$Avg~Cost = \frac{0 + 8 \times $10}{8} = \frac{$80}{8} = $10$$

- Since the *incoming quantity* of tables is [8]{.title-ref} and the
  *purchase price* for each is [\$10]{.title-ref},
- The inventory value in the numerator is evaluated to
  [\$80]{.title-ref};
- [\$80]{.title-ref} is divided by the total amount of tables to store,
  [8]{.title-ref};
- [\$10]{.title-ref} is the average cost of a single table from the
  first shipment.

To verify this in Odoo, in the *Purchase* app, order [8]{.title-ref}
quantities of a new product, [Table]{.title-ref}, with no previous stock
moves, for [\$10]{.title-ref} each.

In the table\'s `Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field in the `General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab of the product form, click the `➡️ (arrow)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon, to open an `External Link`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to edit the product category. Set the
`Costing Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to [Average Cost
(AVCO)]{.title-ref} and `Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to [Automated]{.title-ref}.

Then, return to the purchase order. Click
`Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click `Receive
Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm receipt.

Next, check the inventory valuation record generated by the product
reception by navigating to
`Inventory --> Reporting --> Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select the drop-down for [Table]{.title-ref}, and
view the `Total Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column for the
*valuation layer* (`inventory
valuation at a specific point in time = on-hand quantity * unit price`{.interpreted-text
role="dfn"}). The 8 tables in-stock are worth \$80.

Tip

When the product category\'s `Costing Method`{.interpreted-text

`Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, under the
`General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, on the
product page itself.
::::

#### Product delivery (use case)

For outgoing shipments,
`outbound products have no effect on the average cost valuation
<inventory/avg_cost/definite_rule>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
Although the average cost valuation is not recalculated, the inventory
value still decreases because the product is removed from stock and
delivered to the customer location.

::: exercise
To demonstrate that the average cost valuation is not recalculated,
examine the \"Deliver 10 tables\" example.

$$Avg~Cost = \frac{12 \times $12 + (-10) \times $12}{12-10} = \frac{24}{2} = $12$$

1.  Because 10 tables are being sent out to customers, the *incoming
    quantity* is [-10]{.title-ref}. The previous average cost
    ([\$12]{.title-ref}) is used in lieu of a vendor\'s *purchase
    price*;
2.  The *incoming inventory value* is [-10 \* \$12 =
    -\$120]{.title-ref};
3.  The old *inventory value* ([\$144]{.title-ref}) is added to the
    *incoming inventory value* ([-\$120]{.title-ref}), so [\$144 +
    -\$120 = \$24]{.title-ref};
4.  Only [2]{.title-ref} tables remain after shipping out
    [10]{.title-ref} tables from [12]{.title-ref}. So the current
    *inventory value* ([\$24]{.title-ref}) is divided by the on-hand
    quantity ([2]{.title-ref});
5.  [\$24 / 2 = \$12]{.title-ref}, which is the same average cost as the
    previous operation.

To verify this in Odoo, sell [10]{.title-ref} tables in the *Sales* app,
validate the delivery, and then review the inventory valuation record by
going to in `Inventory --> Reporting -->
Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. In the
topmost valuation layer, delivering [10]{.title-ref} tables reduces the
product\'s value by [-\$120]{.title-ref}.

**Note**: What is not represented in this stock valuation record is the
revenue made from this sale, so this decrease is not a loss to the
company.

![Show how deliveries decrease inventory valuation.](avg_price_valuation/inventory-val-send-10-tables.png){.align-center}
:::

## Return items to supplier (use case) {#inventory/avg_cost/return}

Because the price paid to suppliers can differ from the price the
product is valued at with the
`AVCO (Average Cost Valuation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} method,
Odoo handles returned items in a specific way.

1.  Products are returned to suppliers at the original purchase price,
    but;
2.  The internal cost valuation remains unchanged.

The above
`example table <inventory/avg_cost/math_table>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} is updated as follows:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Operation               Qty\*Avg    Inventory      Qty On Hand Avg Cost
                          Cost        Value                      
  ----------------------- ----------- -------------- ----------- ---------
                                      \$24           2           \$12

  Return 1 table bought   -1 \* \$12  \$12           1           \$12
  at \$10                                                        
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

In other words, returns to vendors are perceived by Odoo as another form
of a product exiting the warehouse. To Odoo, because the table is valued
at \$12 per unit, the inventory value is reduced by [\$12]{.title-ref}
when the product is returned; the initial purchase price of
[\$10]{.title-ref} is unrelated to the table\'s average cost.

::: example
To return a single table that was purchased for [\$10]{.title-ref},
navigate to the receipt in the *Inventory* app for the
`8 tables purchased in Exercise 1 <inventory/avg_cost/ex-1>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} by going to the `Inventory Overview`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, clicking on `Receipts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and selecting the desired receipt.

Then, click `Return`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the validated
delivery order, and modify the quantity to [1]{.title-ref} in the
reverse transfer window. This creates an outgoing shipment for the
table. Select `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm
the outgoing shipment.

Return to
`Inventory --> Reporting --> Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to see how the outgoing shipment decreases the
inventory value by \$12.

![Inventory valuation for return.](avg_price_valuation/inventory-valuation-return.png){.align-center}
:::

### Eliminate stock valuation errors in outgoing products {#inventory/avg_price/leaving_inventory}

Inconsistencies can occur in a company\'s inventory when the average
cost valuation is recalculated on outgoing shipments.

To demonstrate this error, the table below displays a scenario in which
1 table is shipped to a customer and another is returned to a supplier
at the purchased price.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Operation                   Qty\*Price   Inventory    Qty On     Avg Cost
                                           Value        Hand       
  --------------------------- ------------ ------------ ---------- --------
                                           \$24         2          \$12

  Ship 1 product to customer  -1 \* \$12   \$12         1          \$12

  Return 1 product initially  -1 \* \$10   **\$2**      **0**      \$12
  bought at \$10                                                   
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the final operation above, the final inventory valuation for the
table is [\$2]{.title-ref} even though there are [0]{.title-ref} tables
left in stock.

::: admonition
Correct method

Use the average cost to value the return. This does not mean the company
gets \$12 back for a \$10 purchase; the item returned for \$10 is valued
internally at \$12. The inventory value change represents a product
worth \$12 no longer being accounted for in company assets.
:::

## Anglo-Saxon accounting

In addition to using `AVCO (Average Cost Valuation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, companies that use **Anglo-Saxon accounting** also keep a
holding account that tracks the amount to be paid to vendors. Once a
vendor delivers an order, **inventory value** increases based on the
vendor price of the products that have entered the stock. The holding
account (called **stock input**) is credited and only reconciled once
the vendor bill is received.

::: seealso
\-
`Anglo-Saxon vs. Continental <inventory/inventory_valuation_config/accounting>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
:::

The table below reflects journal entries and accounts. The *stock input*
account stores the money intended to pay vendors when the vendor bill
has not yet been received. To balance accounts when returning products
that have a price difference between the price the product is **valued
at** and the price it was bought for, a *price difference* account is
created.

### Product reception

#### Summary

At product reception, Odoo ensures companies can pay for goods that were
purchased by preemptively moving an amount matching the price of
received goods into the `liability account
</applications/finance/accounting/get_started/cheat_sheet>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, **Stock Input**. Then, once the bill has been received, the
amount in the holding account is transferred to *Accounts Payable*.
Transfers into this account means the bill has been paid. **Stock
Input** is reconciled once the vendor bill is received.

Inventory valuation is a method of calculating how much each in-stock
product is worth internally. Since there is a difference between the
price the product is **valuated at** and the price the product was
actually **purchased for**, the **Inventory Valuation** account is
unrelated to the crediting and debiting operations of the **Stock
Input** account.

To conceptualize all this, follow the breakdown below.

#### Accounts balanced at received products

In this example, a company starts with zero units of a product,
[table]{.title-ref}, in stock. Then, 8 tables are received from the
vendor:

1.  The **Stock Input** account stores [\$80]{.title-ref} of credit owed
    to the vendor. The amount in this account is unrelated to the
    inventory value.
2.  [\$80]{.title-ref} worth of tables came **in** (**debit** the
    *Inventory Value* account [\$80]{.title-ref}), and
3.  [\$80]{.title-ref} must be paid **out** for received goods
    (**credit** the *Stock Input* account [\$80]{.title-ref}).

##### In Odoo

Odoo generates an accounting journal entry when shipments that use
`AVCO (Average Cost Valuation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} costing
method are received. Configure a
`Price Difference Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} by
selecting the `➡️ (arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon next
to the `Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on
the product page.

Under `Account Properties`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, create a
new `Price Difference Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} by
typing in the name of the account and clicking
`Create and Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then set the
account `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
[Expenses]{.title-ref}, and click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Create price difference account.](avg_price_valuation/create-price-difference.png){.align-center}

Then, receive the shipment in the *Purchase* app or *Inventory* app, and
navigate to the
`Accounting app --> Accounting --> Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. In the list, find the
`Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that matches the
warehouse reception operation for the relevant product.

![Show accounting entry of 8 tables from the list.](avg_price_valuation/search-for-entry-of-tables.png){.align-center}

Click on the line for 8 tables. This accounting journal entry shows that
when the 8 tables were received, the [Stock Valuation]{.title-ref}
account increased by [\$80]{.title-ref}. Conversely, the **Stock Input**
account (set as [Stock Interim (Received)]{.title-ref} account by
default) is credited [\$80]{.title-ref}.

![Debit stock valuation and credit stock input 80 dollars.](avg_price_valuation/accounting-entry-8-tables.png){.align-center}

#### Accounts balanced at received vendor bill

In this example, a company starts with zero units of a product, table,
in stock. Then, 8 tables are received from the vendor. When the bill is
received from vendor for 8 tables:

1.  Use [\$80]{.title-ref} in the **Stock Input** account to pay the
    bill. This cancels out and the account now holds [\$0]{.title-ref}.
2.  Debit **Stock Input** [\$80]{.title-ref} (to reconcile this
    account).
3.  Credit **Accounts payable** [\$80]{.title-ref}. This account stores
    the amount the company owes others, so accountants use the amount to
    write checks to vendors.

##### In Odoo

Once the vendor requests payment, navigate to the
`Purchase app --> Orders -->
Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select the
`PO (Purchase Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for 8 tables.
Inside the `PO (Purchase
Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, select
`Create Bill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Switch to the `Journal Items`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to
view how [\$80]{.title-ref} is transferred from the holding account,
[Stock Interim (Received)]{.title-ref} to [Accounts
Payable]{.title-ref}. `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the
bill to record the payment to the vendor.

![Show bill linked to the purchase order for 8 tables.](avg_price_valuation/receive-8-table-bill.png){.align-center}

### On product delivery

In the
`above example table <inventory/avg_price/price-table>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, when 10 products are delivered to a customer, the **Stock
Input** account is untouched because there are no new products coming
in. To put it simply:

1.  **Inventory valuation** is credited [\$120]{.title-ref}. Subtracting
    from inventory valuation represents [\$120]{.title-ref} worth of
    products exiting the company.
2.  Debit **Accounts Receivable** to record revenue from the sale.

![Show journal items linked to sale order.](avg_price_valuation/sell-10-tables.png){.align-center}

::: spoiler
Understand Anglo-Saxon expensing

In the accounting journal entry invoicing a customer for 10 tables, the
accounts **Product Sales**, **Tax Received**, and **Accounts
Receivable** all pertain to the sale of the product. **Accounts
Receivable** is the account where the customer payment will be received.

Anglo-Saxon accounting recognizes the cost of goods sold (COGS) once the
sale is made. So, up until the product is sold, scrapped, or returned,
costs of keeping the product in stock are not accounted for. The
**Expense** account is debited [\$120]{.title-ref} to log the costs of
storing 10 tables during this period of time.
:::

### On product return

In the
`above example table <inventory/avg_price/price-table>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, when returning 1 product to a vendor purchased at
[\$10]{.title-ref}, a company expects [\$10]{.title-ref} in the
**Accounts Payable** account from the vendor. However, **Stock Input**
account must be debited [\$12]{.title-ref} because the average cost is
[\$12]{.title-ref} at the time of the return. The missing
[\$2]{.title-ref} is accounted for in the `Price Difference
Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which is set up in the
product\'s `Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Behavior of *price difference accounts* varies from localization. In
this case, the account is intended to store differences between vendor
price and *automated* inventory valuation methods.
::::

Summary:

1.  Debit **Stock Input** account [\$10]{.title-ref} to move the table
    from stock to stock input. This move is to indicate that the table
    is to be processed for an outgoing shipment.
2.  Debit **Stock Input** an additional [\$2]{.title-ref} to account for
    the **Price Difference**.
3.  Credit **Stock Valuation** [\$12]{.title-ref} because the item is
    leaving the stock.

![2 dollar difference expensed in Price Difference account.](avg_price_valuation/expensing-price-difference-account.png){.align-center}

Once the vendor\'s refund is received,

1.  Credit **Stock Input** account [\$10]{.title-ref} to reconcile the
    price of the table.
2.  Debit **Accounts Payable** [\$10]{.title-ref} to have the
    accountants collect and register the payment in their journal.

# Chart of accounts

The **chart of accounts (COA)** is the list of all the accounts used to
record financial transactions in the general ledger of an organization.
The chart of accounts can be found under
`Accounting-->Configuration-->Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

When browsing your chart of accounts, you can sort the accounts by
`Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Account Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, but other options are
available in the drop-down menu `(⋮)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Group the accounts by type in Odoo Accounting](chart_of_accounts/chart-of-accounts-sort.png)

## Configuration of an account

The country you select during the creation of your database (or
additional company in your database) determines which
`fiscal localization package <../../fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is installed by default. This package includes a standard
chart of accounts already configured according to the country\'s
regulations. You can use it directly or set it according to your
company\'s needs.

To create a new account, go to
`Accounting-->Configuration-->Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text

### Code and name

Each account is identified by its `Code`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which
also indicate the account\'s purpose.

### Type {#chart-of-account/type}

Correctly configuring the **account type** is critical as it serves
multiple purposes:

- Information on the account\'s purpose and behavior
- Generate country-specific legal and financial reports
- Set the rules to close a fiscal year
- Generate opening entries

To configure an account type, open the `Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field\'s drop-down selector and select the
corresponding type from the following list:

+---------------+--------------+-------------------------+
| Report        | Category     | Account Types           |

#### Assets, deferred expenses, and deferred revenues automation

Some **account types** can **automate** the creation of
`assets <assets-automation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} entries,
`deferred expenses <deferred-expenses-automation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} entries, and
`deferred revenues <deferred-revenues-automation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} entries. To **automate** entries, click
`Setup`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on an account line and go to
the `Automation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

You have three choices for the `Automation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab:

1.  `No`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this is the default value.
    Nothing happens.
2.  `Create in draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: whenever a
    transaction is posted on the account, a draft entry is created but
    not validated. You must first fill out the corresponding form.
3.  `Create and validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: you must
    also select a `Deferred Expense Model`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}. Whenever a transaction is posted on the account,
    an entry is created and immediately validated.

### Default taxes

In the `Setup`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu of an account,
select a **default tax** to be applied when this account is chosen for a
product sale or purchase.

### Tags

Some accounting reports require **tags** to be set on the relevant
accounts. To add a tag, under `Setup`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, click the `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field and select an existing tag or `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} a new one.

### Account groups

**Account groups** are useful to list multiple accounts as
*sub-accounts* of a bigger account and thus consolidate reports such as
the **Trial Balance**. By default, groups are handled automatically
based on the code of the group. For example, a new account
[131200]{.title-ref} is going to be part of the group
[131000]{.title-ref}. You can attribute a specific group to an account
in the `Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field under
`Setup`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

#### Create account groups manually

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Regular users should not need to create account groups manually. The
following section is only intended for rare and advanced use cases.
::::

To create a new account group, activate
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and head
to `Accounting app-->Configuration-->Account Groups`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Here, create a new group and enter the
`name, code prefix, and company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
which that group account should be available. Note that you must enter
the same code prefix in both `From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields.

![Account groups creation.](chart_of_accounts/account-groups.png)

To display your **Trial Balance** report with your account groups, go to
`Accounting-->Reporting-->Trial Balance`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then open the `Options`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} menu and select
`Hierarchy and Subtotals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Account Groups in the Trial Balance in Odoo Accounting](chart_of_accounts/chart-of-accounts-groups.png)

### Allow reconciliation

Some accounts, such as accounts made to record the transactions of a
payment method, can be used for the reconciliation of journal entries.

For example, an invoice paid with a credit card can be marked as
`paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if reconciled with its
payment. Therefore, the account used to record credit card payments
needs to be configured as **allowing reconciliation**.

To do so, check the `Allow Reconciliation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} box in the account\'s settings, and
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}; or enable the button from the
chart of accounts view.

![Allow reconciliation for accounts in Odoo Accounting](chart_of_accounts/chart-of-accounts-reconciliation.png)

### Deprecated

It is not possible to delete an account once a transaction has been
recorded on it. You can make them unusable by using the **Deprecated**
feature: check the `Deprecated`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box
in the account\'s settings, and `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

What is owned (an asset) has been financed through debts to reimburse
(liabilities) or equity (profits, capital).

A difference is made between **assets** and **expenses**:

:   - An **asset** is a resource with economic value that an individual,
      corporation, or country owns or controls with the expectation that
      it will provide a future benefit. Assets are reported on a
      company\'s balance sheet. They are bought or created to increase a
      firm\'s value or benefit its operations.
    - An **expense** is the costs of operations a company bears to
      generate revenues.

## Chart of accounts

The **chart of accounts** lists all the company\'s accounts: both
Balance sheet accounts and P&L accounts. Every transaction is recorded
by debiting and crediting multiple accounts in a journal entry. In a
way, a chart of accounts is like a company\'s DNA!

Every account listed in the chart of accounts belongs to a specific
category. In Odoo, each account has a unique code and belongs to one of
these categories:

- 

  **Equity and subordinated debts**

  :   - **Equity** is the amount of money invested by a company\'s
        shareholders to finance the company\'s activities.
      - **Subordinated debts** are the amount of money lent by a third
        party to a company to finance its activities. In the event of
        the dissolution of a company, these third parties are reimbursed
        before the shareholders.

- **Fixed assets** are tangible (i.e., physical) items or properties
  that a company purchases and uses to produce its goods and services.
  Fixed assets are long-term assets. This means the assets have a useful
  life of more than one year. They also include properties, plants, and
  equipments (also known as \"PP&E\") and are recorded on the balance
  sheet with that classification.

- 

  **Current assets and liabilities**

  :   - The **current assets** account is a balance sheet line item
        listed under the Assets section, which accounts for all
        company-owned assets that can be converted to cash within one
        year. Current assets include cash, cash equivalents, accounts
        receivable, stock inventory, marketable securities, prepaid
        liabilities, and other liquid assets.
      - **Current liabilities** are a company\'s short-term financial
        obligations due within one year. An example of a current
        liability is money owed to suppliers in the form of accounts
        payable.

- 

  **Bank and cash accounts**

  :   - A **bank account** is a financial account maintained by a bank
        or other financial institution in which the financial
        transactions between the bank and a customer are recorded.
      - A **cash account**, or cash book, may refer to a ledger in which
        all cash transactions are recorded. The cash account includes
        both the cash receipts and the cash payment journals.

- 

  **Expenses and income**

  :   - An **expense** is the costs of operations a company bears to
        generate revenues. It is simply defined as the cost one is
        required to spend on obtaining something. Common expenses
        include supplier payments, employee wages, factory leases, and
        equipment depreciation.
      - The term \"\*\*income\*\*\" generally refers to the amount of
        money, property, and other transfers of value received over a
        set period of time in exchange for services or products.

### Example

> \*: Customer Refund and Customer Payment boxes cannot be
> simultaneously selected as they are contradictory.

## Journal entries {#cheat_sheet/journals}

Every financial document of the company (e.g., an invoice, a bank
statement, a pay slip, a capital increase contract) is recorded as a
journal entry, impacting several accounts.

For a journal entry to be balanced, the sum of all its debits must be
equal to the sum of all its credits.

> examples of accounting entries for various transactions. (see
> entries.js)

## Reconciliation {#accounting/reconciliation}

`Reconciliation <../../accounting/bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is the process of linking journal items of a specific
account and matching credits and debits.

Its primary purpose is to link payments to their related invoices to
mark them as paid. This is done by doing a reconciliation on the
accounts receivable account and/or the accounts payable account.

Reconciliation is performed automatically by the system when:

- the payment is registered directly on the invoice
- the links between the payments and the invoices are detected at the
  bank matching process

## Bank Reconciliation

Bank reconciliation is the matching of bank statement lines (provided by
your bank) with transactions recorded internally (payments to suppliers
or from customers). For each line in a bank statement, it can be:

- **matched with a previously recorded payment**: a payment is
  registered when a check is received from a customer, then matched when
  checking the bank statement.
- **recorded as a new payment**: the payment\'s journal entry is created
  and reconciled with the related invoice when processing the bank
  statement.
- **recorded as another transaction**: bank transfer, direct charge,
  etc.

Odoo should automatically reconcile most transactions; only a few should
need manual review. When the bank reconciliation process is finished,
the balance on the bank account in Odoo should match the bank
statement\'s balance.

## Checks Handling

There are two approaches to managing checks and internal wire transfers:

- Two journal entries and a reconciliation
- One journal entry and a bank reconciliation

# Multi-currency system

Odoo allows you to issue invoices, receive bills, and record
transactions in currencies other than the main currency configured for
your company. You can also set up bank accounts in other currencies and
run reports on your foreign currency activities.

::: seealso
\- `../bank/foreign_currency`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Configuration {#multi-currency/config}

### Main currency {#multi-currency/config-main-currency}

The **main currency** is defined by default according to the company\'s
country. You can change it by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and changing the currency in the
`Main Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting.

### Enable foreign currencies {#multi-currency/config-enable}

Go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and enable the currencies you wish to use by
toggling the `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![Enable the currencies you wish to use.](multi_currency/enable-foreign-currencies.png){.align-center}

### Currency rates {#multi-currency/config-rates}

#### Manual update

To manually create and set a currency rate, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Currencies`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, click on the
currency you wish to change the rate of, and under the
`Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a new rate.

![Create or modify the currency rate.](multi_currency/manual-rate-update.png){.align-center}

#### Automatic update

When you activate a second currency for the first time,
`Automatic Currency Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears
under
`Accounting Dashboard --> Configuration --> Settings --> Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. By default, you have to click on the **Update
now** button (`🗘`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) to update the
rates.

Odoo can update the rates at regular intervals. To do so, change the
`Interval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from
`Manually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Daily`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Weekly`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. You
can also select the web service from which you want to retrieve the
latest currency rates by clicking on the `Service`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

### Exchange difference entries {#multi-currency/config-exch-diff}

Odoo automatically records exchange differences entries on dedicated
accounts, in a dedicated journal.

You can define which journal and accounts to use to **post exchange
difference entries** by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Default Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and editing the `Journal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Gain Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Loss Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: example
If you receive a payment for a customer invoice one month after it was
issued, the exchange rate has likely changed since. Therefore, this
fluctuation implies some profit or loss due to the exchange difference,
which Odoo automatically records in the default **Exchange Difference**
journal.
:::

### Chart of accounts {#multi-currency/config-coa}

Each account can have a set currency. By doing so, all moves relevant to
the account are forced to have that account\'s currency.

To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Charts of Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select a currency in the field
`Account Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If left empty,
all active currencies are handled instead of just one.

### Journals {#multi-currency/config-journals}

If a currency is set on a **journal**, that journal only handles
transactions in that currency.

To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, open the journal you want to edit, and select a
currency in the field `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Select the currency for the journal to handle.](multi_currency/journal-currency.png){.align-center}

## Multi-currency accounting {#multi-currency/mca}

### Invoices, bills, and other documents {#multi-currency/mca-documents}

For all documents, you can select the currency and journal to use for
the transaction on the document itself.

![Select the currency and journal to use.](multi_currency/currency-field.png){.align-center}

### Payment registration {#multi-currency/mca-payment}

To register a payment in a currency other than your company\'s main
currency, click on the `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} payment button of your document and, in the pop-up
window, select a **currency** in the `Amount`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

![Select the currency and journal to use before registering the payment.](multi_currency/register-payment.png){.align-center}

### Bank transactions {#multi-currency/mca-statements}

When creating or importing bank transactions, the amount is in the
company\'s main currency. To input a **foreign currency**, select a
currency in the `Foreign Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Once selected, enter the `Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
your main currency for it to automatically get converted in the foreign
currency in the `Amount in Currency field`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![The extra fields related to foreign currencies.](multi_currency/foreign-fields.png){.align-center}

When reconciling, Odoo displays both the foreign currency amount and the
equivalent amount in your company\'s main currency.

### Exchange rate journal entries {#multi-currency/mca-exch-entries}

To see **exchange difference journal entries**, go to
`Accounting Dashboard -->
Accounting --> Journals: Miscellaneous`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![Exchange rate journal entry.](multi_currency/exchange-journal-currency.png){.align-center}

# VAT units

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

This is only applicable to multi-company environments.
::::

A **VAT unit** is a group of VAT-taxable enterprises that are legally
independent of each other but are closely linked financially,
organizationally, and economically and therefore considered the same
VAT-taxable enterprise. **VAT units** are not mandatory, but if created,
constituent companies of the unit must belong to the same **country**,
use the same **currency**, and one company must be designated as the
**representative** company of the **VAT unit**. **VAT units** receive a
specific **tax ID** intended only for **tax returns**. **Constituent**
companies keep their **tax ID** used for **commercial purposes**.

::: example
Enterprise **A** owes €300.000,00 of VAT taxes and enterprise **B** can
recover €280.000,00 of VAT taxes. They form up as a **VAT unit** so that
the two amounts balance out and must conjointly only pay €20.000,00 of
VAT taxes.
:::

## Configuration

To configure a **VAT unit**, go to
`Settings --> General Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
scroll down to the `Companies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section, and click `Manage Companies`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Select the company to serve the **representative**
role, and in the `General Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, fill in the mandatory fields for the .XML export
when exporting the **tax report**: `Company Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Currency`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![General information tab](vat_units/general.png){.align-center}

Then, click on the `VAT Units`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and either select an
existing **VAT unit**, or create a new one. Enter a **name** for the
unit, `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the constituent
companies and tax report, the `Companies`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, the `Main Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
that serves the **representative** role, and the
`Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the **VAT unit**.

![VAT units tab](vat_units/vat-unit.png){.align-center}

### Fiscal position

As transactions between constituents of the same **VAT unit** are not
subject to VAT, it is possible to create a
`tax mapping (fiscal position) <../taxes/fiscal_positions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to avoid the application of VAT on inter-constituent
transactions.

Be sure a constituent company has been selected before, then go to
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Fiscal Positions`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} a
new **fiscal position**. Click the `Tax Mapping`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, select the `Tax on Product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} usually applied for **non-constituent** transactions,
and in `Tax to Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select the 0%
tax to apply for **constituent** transactions.

Do the same for the `Account Mapping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab if required, and repeat this process for **each** constituent
company on your database.

::: example
Depending on your
`localization package </applications/finance/fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, taxes may vary from the screenshot displayed.

![Tax mapping of fiscal position for VAT unit](vat_units/fiscal-positions.png){.align-center}
:::

Then, assign the fiscal position by opening the **Contacts** app. Search
for a **constituent** company, and open the contact\'s **card**. Click
the `Sales & Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and in
the `Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, input
the **fiscal position** created for the **VAT unit**. Repeat the process
for each **constituent** company card form, on each company database.

::: seealso
`../taxes/fiscal_positions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
:::

## Tax report

The **representative** company can access the aggregated tax report of
the **VAT unit** by going to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and selecting the **VAT unit** in
`Tax Unit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This report contains the
aggregated transactions of all **constituents** and the .XML export
contains the name and VAT number of the **main** company.

# Get started

When you first open your Odoo Accounting app, the
`Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} welcomes you
with a step-by-step onboarding banner, a wizard that helps you get
started. This onboarding banner is displayed until you choose to close
it.

The settings visible in the onboarding banner can still be modified
later by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

:::: note
::: title

# Batch payments by bank deposit

A **batch deposit** is a convenient way to group customer payments and
deposit them into your bank account. The feature lets you list multiple
payments and generate a detailed deposit slip with a batch reference.
This reference can be used when reconciling to match bank statement
lines with transactions in the batch deposit.

## Configuration

Go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Customer Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and tick `Batch Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to activate the feature.

## Deposit multiple payments in batch

### Register payments

Before performing a batch deposit, it is necessary to register each
transaction\'s payment. To do so, open the corresponding customer
invoice and click `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
In the pop-up window, select the `Journal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} linked to your bank account and
`Batch Deposit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as the
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`Create Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Registering a customer payment as part of a batch deposit](batch/batch-payments.png){.align-center}

### Add payments to a batch deposit

To add payments to a batch deposit, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Batch
Payments`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Next, select the
`Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and choose `Batch
Deposit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as the
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Filling out a new inbound batch payment form](batch/batch-customer-payment.png){.align-center}

Click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In the pop-up
window, tick all payments to include in the batch deposit, then click
`Select`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Selecting all payments to include in the batch deposit](batch/batch-lines-selection.png){.align-center}

Once done, click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
finalize the batch deposit.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Click `Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to download a PDF file
to include with the deposit slip.

### Bank reconciliation

Once the bank transactions are on your database, you can reconcile bank
statement lines with the batch payment. To do so, go to the
`Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and click
`Reconcile
Items`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the related bank account.
Go to the `Batch Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to
select a specific batch and click `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to finalize the process.

# Batch payments: SEPA Direct Debit (SDD)

SEPA, the Single Euro Payments Area, is a payment-integration initiative
of the European Union for simplification of bank transfers denominated
in euros. With **SEPA Direct Debit** (SDD), your customers can sign a
mandate that authorizes you to collect future payments from their bank
accounts. This is particularly useful for recurring payments based on a
subscription.

You can record customer mandates in Odoo, and generate
[.xml]{.title-ref} files containing pending payments made with an SDD
mandate.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\| SDD is supported by all SEPA countries, which includes the 27 member
states of the European Union as well as additional countries. \| [List
of all SEPA
countries](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/document-library/other/epc-list-sepa-scheme-countries).
::::

## Configuration

Go to `Accounting app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, activate
`SEPA Direct Debit (SDD)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
on `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Enter your company\'s
`Creditor Identifier`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This number is
provided by your bank institution, or the authority responsible for
delivering them.

![Add a SEPA Creditor Identifier to Odoo Accounting](batch_sdd/creditor-identifier.png){.align-center}

## SEPA Direct Debit Mandates

### Create a mandate

The `SDD (sepa direct debit)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} Mandate is
the document that your customers sign to authorize you to collect money
directly from their bank accounts.

To create a new mandate, go to `Accounting app --> Customers -->
Direct Debit Mandates`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, on
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and fill out the form.
Export the PDF file by clicking on `Print`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. It is then up to your customer to sign this document.
Once done, upload the signed file and click on
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to start running the
mandate.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Make sure that the **IBAN bank accounts details** are correctly recorded
on the debtor's contact form, under the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and in your own
`Bank Account <../bank>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} settings.
::::

### SEPA Direct Debit as a payment method

SDD can be used as a payment method both on your **eCommerce** or on the
**Customer Portal** by activating SDD as a **Payment Provider**. With
this method, your customers can create and sign their mandates
themselves.

To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Payment Providers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click on *SEPA Direct Debit*, and set it up
according to your needs. To do so, go to
`Accounting app --> Configuration --> Payment Acquirers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click on `SEPA Direct Debit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Make sure to change the `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
to `Enabled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and to check
`Online Signature`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, as this is
necessary to let your customers sign their mandates.
::::

Customers using SDD as payment method get prompted to add their IBAN,
email address, and to sign their SEPA Direct Debit mandate.

::: todo
Add link to future **Payment Provider** documentation.
:::

### Close or revoke a mandate

Direct debit mandates are closed automatically after their
`End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If this field is left
blank, the mandate keeps being **Active** until it is **Closed** or
**Revoked**.

Clicking on `Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} updates the
mandate's end day to the current day. This means that invoices issued
after the present day will not be processed with an SDD payment.

Clicking on `Revoke`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} disables the
mandate immediately. No SDD payment can be registered anymore,
regardless of the invoice's date. However, payments that have already
been registered are still included in the next SDD [.xml]{.title-ref}
file.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Once a mandate has been `closed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`revoked`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, it cannot be reactivated.
::::

## Get paid with SEPA Direct Debit batch payments

### Customer invoices

You can register SDD payments for invoices issued to customers who have
an active SDD mandate.

To do so, open the invoice, click on
`Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and choose
`SEPA Direct Debit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as payment
method.

### Generate SEPA Direct Debit [.XML]{.title-ref} files to submit payments

[.xml]{.title-ref} files with all SDD payment instructions can be
uploaded to your online banking interface to process all payments at
once.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The files generated by Odoo follow the SEPA Direct Debit
**PAIN.008.001.02** specifications, as required by the SEPA
customer-to-bank [implementation
guidelines](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/document-library/implementation-guidelines/sepa-credit-transfer-customer-psp-implementation),
which ensures compatibility with the banks.
::::

To generate your [.xml]{.title-ref} file of multiple pending SDD
payments, you can create a batch payment. To do so, go to
`Accounting app --> Customers --> Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select the needed payments, then click on
`Action`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and finally
`Create a batch Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Once you
click on `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
[.xml]{.title-ref} file is directly available for download.

![Generate an .XML file for your SDD payments in Odoo Accounting](batch_sdd/xml.png){.align-center}

Finally, upload this file to your online banking interface to process
the payments.

# Checks

There are two ways to handle payments received by checks in Odoo, either
by using `outstanding
accounts <checks/outstanding-account>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or
by `bypassing the reconciliation process
<checks/reconciliation-bypass>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

**Using outstanding accounts is recommended**, as your bank account
balance stays accurate by taking into account checks yet to be cashed.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Both methods produce the same data in your accounting at the end of the
process. But if you have checks that have not been cashed in, the
**Outstanding Account** method reports these checks in the **Outstanding
Receipts** account. However, funds appear in your bank account whether
or not they are reconciled, as the bank value is reflected at the moment
of the bank statement.
::::

::: seealso
\* `Outstanding accounts <bank/outstanding-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} \*
`Bank reconciliation <accounting/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
:::

## Method 1: Outstanding account {#checks/outstanding-account}

When you receive a check, you
`record a payment <../bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} by check on the invoice. Then, when your bank account is
credited with the check\'s amount, you reconcile the payment and
statement to move the amount from the **Outstanding Receipt** account to
the **Bank** account.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can create a new payment method named *Checks* if you would like to
identify such payments quickly. To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals --> Bank`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click the `Incoming Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. As `Payment
Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select
`Manual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, enter [Checks]{.title-ref}
as name, and `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

## Method 2: Reconciliation bypass {#checks/reconciliation-bypass}

When you receive a check, you
`record a payment <../bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} on the related invoice. The amount is then moved from the
**Account Receivable** to the **Bank** account, bypassing the
reconciliation and creating only **one journal entry**.

To do so, you *must* follow the following setup. Go to
`Accounting --> Configuration
--> Journals --> Bank`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Click
the `Incoming Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and then
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select
`Manual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and enter
[Checks]{.title-ref} as `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click
the toggle menu button, tick
`Outstanding Receipts accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
in the `Outstanding Receipts accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column, and set the `Bank`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} account for the **Checks** payment method.

![Bypass the Outstanding Receipts account using the Bank account.](checks/outstanding-payment-accounts.png)

## Payment registration

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

By default, there are two ways to register payments made by check:

- **Manual**: for single checks;
- **Batch**: for multiple checks at once.

This documentation focuses on **single-check** payments. For **batch
deposits**, see `the
batch payments documentation <batch>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
::::

Once you receive a customer check, go to the related invoice
(`Accounting -->
Customer --> Invoices)`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
click `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Fill in the
payment information:

- `Journal: Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
- `Payment method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `Manual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (or **Checks** if you have
  created a specific payment method);
- `Memo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the check number;
- Click `Create Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Check payment info](checks/payment-checks.png)

The generated journal entries are different depending on the payment
registration method chosen.

## Journal entries

### Outstanding account

The invoice is marked as `In Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
as soon as you record the payment. This operation produces the following
**journal entry**:

  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  Account                Statement Match     Debit      Credit
  ---------------------- ------------------- ---------- ----------
  Account Receivable                                    100.00

  Outstanding Receipts                       100.00     
  ----------------------------------------------------------------

Then, once you receive the bank statements, match this statement with
the check of the **Outstanding Receipts** account. This produces the
following **journal entry**:

+---------------------+-------------------+----------+----------+
| Account             | Statement Match   | Debit    | Credit   |
+=====================+===================+==========+==========+
| Outstanding         | > X               |          | 100.00   |
| Receipts            |                   |          |          |
+---------------------+-------------------+----------+----------+
| Bank                |                   | 100.00   |          |
+---------------------+-------------------+----------+----------+

If you use this approach to manage received checks, you get the list of
checks that have not been cashed in the **Outstanding Receipt** account
(accessible, for example, from the general ledger).

### Reconciliation bypass

The invoice is marked as `Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
soon as you record the check.

With this approach, you bypass the use of **outstanding accounts**,
effectively getting only one journal entry in your books and bypassing
the reconciliation:

  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  Account                Statement Match     Debit      Credit
  ---------------------- ------------------- ---------- ----------
  Account Receivable     X                              100.00

  Bank                                       100.00     
  ----------------------------------------------------------------

# Follow-up on invoices

A follow-up message can be sent to customers when a payment is overdue.
Odoo helps you identify late payments and allows you to schedule and
send the appropriate reminders using **follow-up actions** that
automatically trigger one or more actions according to the number of
overdue days. You can send your follow-ups via different means, such as
email, post, or SMS.

\- [Odoo Tutorials: Payment
Follow-up](https://www.odoo.com/slides/slide/payment-follow-up-1682)
:::

## Configuration

To configure a `Follow-Up Action`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, go
to `Accounting --> Configuration -->
Follow-up Levels`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select or
create (a) new follow-up level(s). Several follow-up actions are
available by default under the `Notification`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and the **name** as well as the **number of days**
can be changed. The follow-up `Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} available are:

- `Send Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
- `Send a Letter <customer_invoices/snailmail>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"};
- `Send an SMS message <pricing/pricing_and_faq>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

You can use a pre-filled template for your messages by selecting a
`Content Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To change the
template used, hover over the field and click the
`-->`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If enabled, SMS messages have
a specific `Sms Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

It is possible to automatically send a reminder by enabling the
`Automatic`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, and attaching the
*open* invoice(s) by enabling `Attach Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, within a specific follow-up action.

By clicking on the `Activity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
scheduling activities (tasks) is possible. That way, an activity is
automatically scheduled when the follow-up is triggered. To do so,
enable `Schedule Activity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
select a `Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} person for the
task. Choose an `Activity Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
enter a `Summary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on how to handle
the activity, if desired.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Set a negative number of days to send a reminder before the actual due
date.
::::

## Follow-up reports

Overdue invoices you need to follow up on are available in
`Accounting --> Customers
--> Follow-up Reports`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. By
default, Odoo filters by `Overdue Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, but you can also filter by
`In need of action`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu.

When selecting an invoice, you can see all of the customer\'s unpaid
invoices (overdue or not), with the due dates of late invoices appearing
in red. You can exclude invoices from a reminder by clicking
`Exclude from Follow-ups`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. You can
set either `Automatic`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Manual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} reminders as well as a
`Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} person for that
customer.

To send reminders, click on `Follow up`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and select the action(s) you want to perform from:

- `Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
- `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
- `Sms`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
- `By post`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

You can `Attach Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and change
the content templates from this view. When done, click
`Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Send & Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- The contact information on the invoice or the contact form is used to
send the reminder. - When the reminder is sent, it is documented in the
chatter of the invoice. - If it is not the right time for a reminder,
you can specify the `Next Reminder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
date. You will get the next report according to the next reminder date
set.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Reconcile all bank statements right before launching the follow-up
process to avoid sending a reminder to a customer that has already paid.
::::

### Debtor\'s trust level

To know whether a customer usually pays late or not, you can set a trust
level by marking them as `Good Debtor`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Normal Debtor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Bad Debtor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on their follow-up
report. To do so, click on the bullet next to the customer\'s name and
select a trust level.

![Set debtor\'s trust level](follow_up/debtor-level.png)

### Send reminders in batches

You can send reminder emails in batches from the
`Follow-up Reports`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page. To do so,
select all the reports you would like to process, click on the
`Action`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} gear icon, and select
`Process follow-ups`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Forecast future bills to pay

In Odoo, you can manage payments by setting automatic **Payments Terms**
and **follow-ups**.

## Configuration: payment terms

In order to track vendor conditions, we use **Payment Terms** in Odoo.
They allow keeping track of due dates on invoices. Examples of **Payment
Terms** are:

- 50% within 30 days
- 50% within 45 days

To create them, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Invoicing: Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click on `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to add new terms or click existing ones to modify them.

::: seealso
[Odoo Tutorials: Payment
Terms](https://www.odoo.com/slides/slide/payment-terms-1679?fullscreen=1)
:::

Once **Payment Terms** are defined, you can assign them to your vendor
by default. To do so, go to `Vendors --> Vendors`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select a vendor, click the
`Sales & Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and select a
specific **Payment Term**. This way, every time you purchase from this
vendor, Odoo automatically proposes the chosen Payment Term.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If you do not set a specific Payment Term on a vendor, you can still set
one on the vendor bill.
::::

## Forecast bills to pay with the aged payable report

To track amounts to be paid to the vendors, use the **Aged Payable**
report. To access it, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Partner Reports: Aged Payable`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. This report gives you a summary per vendor of the
amounts to pay, compared to their due date (the due date being computed
on each bill using the terms). This report tells you how much you will
have to pay within the following months.

## Select bills to pay

You can get a list of all your vendor bills by going to
`Vendors --> Bills`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. To view
only the bills that you need to pay, click
`Filters --> Bills to Pay`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. To
view only overdue payments, select the `Overdue`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} filter instead.

You can also group bills by their due date by clicking
`Group By --> Due Date`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
selecting a time period.

# Internal transfers

In Odoo, internal money transfers can be made in a few clicks. You need
at least either two bank accounts, two cash journals, or one bank
account and one cash journal.

## Configuration

An internal transfer account is automatically created on your database
based on your company\'s localization and depending on your country's
legislation. If needed, the default `Internal
transfer account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be modified by
going to `Accounting app --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and then under the
`Default Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

At least two bank accounts are needed to make internal transfers. Refer
to `Bank and cash accounts section <../bank>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to see how to add an additional bank account to your
database.
::::

## Register an internal transfer from one bank to another

Let\'s say you have two bank accounts registered on your database and
you want to transfer 1,000 USD from Bank A to Bank B.

### Log an internal transfer

From the Accounting Dashboard, click on the drop-down selection button
(`⋮`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) on one of your banks. In the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column click on
`Internal Transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and enter the
information related to the transfer.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Fill in the `Memo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field for
automatic reconciliation.
::::

`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to register your internal
transfer. The money is now booked in the transfer account and another
payment is **automatically** created in the destination journal (Bank
B).

#### Bank journal (Bank A)

  **Account**                     **Debit**     **Credit**
  ------------------------------- ------------- ------------

#### Automated booking - Bank journal (BANK B)

  **Account**                     **Debit**   **Credit**
  ------------------------------- ----------- -------------
  Outstanding Receipts account    \$1,000     
  **Internal transfer account**               **\$1,000**

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

There are one outstanding payment and one outstanding receipt pending in
your two bank account journals, because the bank statement confirming
the sending and receiving of the money has not been booked yet.
::::

### Manage and reconcile bank statements {#interbank/import-and-reconcile}

The next step is to book the bank statements to finalize the transaction
by creating, `importing <../bank/transactions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, or
`synchronizing <../bank/bank_synchronization>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} your `Transactions lines`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Fill in the `Ending balance`{.interpreted-text

In the next window, choose counterparts for the payment - in this
example, the outstanding payment account - then click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Install the patch to disable online invoice payment

Following recent changes in Odoo 16, you might be warned that disabling
the `Invoice
Online Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting will
uninstall modules. If you want to disable the feature without
uninstalling modules, follow the steps below to install the module
**Payment - Account / Invoice Online Payment Patch**.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\| If your Odoo database is created after the module **Payment - Account
/ Invoice Online Payment Patch** was released, you don\'t have anything
to do. \| To check if the module is already installed, go to
`Apps`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, remove the [Apps]{.title-ref}
filter, and search for [account_payment]{.title-ref}. If the module
**Payment - Account / Invoice Online Payment Patch** is present and
marked as installed, your Odoo database is already up-to-date and you
are able to disable the feature without side-effect.
::::

## Update Odoo to the latest release

The possibility to disable the
`Invoice Online Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting
without side-effect is made available through a new Odoo module; to be
able to install it, you must make sure that your Odoo source code is
up-to-date.

If you use Odoo on Odoo.com or Odoo.sh platform, your code is already
up-to-date and you can proceed to the next step.

If you use Odoo with an on-premise setup or through a partner, you must
update your installation as detailed in
`this documentation page </administration/on_premise/update>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, or by contacting your integrating partner.

## Update the list of available modules

New modules must be *discovered* by your Odoo instance to be available
in the **Apps** menu.

To do so, activate the
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and go
to `Apps -->
Update Apps List`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. A wizard will
ask for confirmation.

## Install the module Invoice Online Payment Patch

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

You should never install new modules in your production database without
first testing them in a duplicate or staging environment. For Odoo.com
customers, a duplicate database can be created from the database
management page. For Odoo.sh users, you should use a staging or
duplicate database. For on-premise users, you should use a staging
environment\-\--contact your integrating partner for more information
regarding how to test a new module in your particular setup.
::::

The module should now be available in your `Apps`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} menu. Remove the `Apps` filter and search for
`account_payment`; the module
`Payment - Account / Invoice Online Payment Patch`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} should be available for installation. If you cannot
find the module after having updated the list of available modules, it
means your Odoo source code is not up-to-date; refer to step one of this
page.

Once the module is installed, disabling the feature will work as
intended and will not ask you to uninstall installed applications or
modules.

# Pay by checks

Once you decide to pay a supplier bill, you can select to pay by check.
You can then print all the payments registered by check. Finally, the
bank reconciliation process will match the checks you sent to suppliers
with actual bank statements.

## Configuration

### Activate checks payment methods

To activate the checks payment method, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and scroll down to
the `Vendor Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. There,
you can activate the payment method as well as set up the
`Check Layout`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Once the `Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} setting is
activated, the **Checks** payment method is automatically set up in the
`Outgoing Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tabs of **bank**
journals. - Some countries require specific modules to print checks;
such modules may be installed by default. For instance, the
`U.S. Checks Layout`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} module is
required to print U.S. checks.
::::

## Compatible check stationery for printing checks

### United States

For the United States, Odoo supports by default the check formats of:

- **Quickbooks & Quicken**: check on top, stubs in the middle and
  bottom;
- **Peachtree**: check in the middle, stubs on top and bottom;
- **ADP**: check in the bottom, and stubs on the top.

## Pay a supplier bill with a check

Paying a supplier with a check is done in three steps:

1.  registering a payment
2.  printing checks in batch for all registered payments
3.  reconciling bank statements

### Register a payment by check

To register a payment, open any supplier bill from the menu
`Purchases --> Vendor
Bills`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Once the supplier bill
is validated, you can register a payment. Set the
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and validate the payment.

### Print checks

On your `Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} Journal, you can see the
number of checks registered. By clicking on
`Checks to print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} you have got the
possibility to print the reconciled checks.

To print all checks in batch, select all payments from the list view and
click on `Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.




--- SOURCE: finance/accounting/payments/pay_sepa.md ---

# Pay with SEPA

SEPA, the Single Euro Payments Area, is a payment-integration initiative
of the European Union to simplify bank transfers denominated in euros.
SEPA allows you to send payment orders to your bank to automate bank
wire transfers.

SEPA is supported by the banks of the 27 EU member states, as well as:

EFTA countries:

- Iceland;
- Liechtenstein;
- Norway;
- Switzerland.

Non-EEA SEPA countries:

- Andorra;
- Monaco;
- San Marino;
- United Kingdom;
- Vatican City State.

Non-EEA territories:

- Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon;
- Guernsey;
- Jersey;
- Isle of Man.

When paying a bill in Odoo, you can select SEPA mandates as a payment
option. At the end of the day, you can generate the SEPA file containing
all bank wire transfers and upload it to your online banking interface
to process the payments.

By default, the file follows the SEPA Credit Transfer
**\'pain.001.001.03\'** specifications. This is a well-defined standard
among banks. However, for Swiss and German companies, other formats are
used **\'pain.001.001.03.ch.02\'** for Switzerland and
**\'pain.001.003.03\'** for Germany.

Once the payments are processed by your bank, you can directly import
the account statement in Odoo. The bank reconciliation process will
seamlessly match the SEPA orders you sent to your bank with actual bank
statements.

## Configuration

### Activate SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT)

To pay suppliers with SEPA, you must activate the **SEPA Credit
Transfer** setting. To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Vendor Payments: SEPA Credit Transfer
(SCT)`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. By activating the
setting and filling out your company data, you will be able to use the
SCT option when paying your vendor.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

According to the localization package installed, the **SEPA Direct
Debit** and **SEPA Credit Transfer** modules may be installed by
default. If not, they need to be
`installed <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

### Activate SEPA payment methods on banks

From the accounting dashboard, click on the drop-down menu
(`⋮`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) on your bank journal and select
`Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click the
`Outgoing Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and, if not
already present, add `SEPA Credit Transfer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} under `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Make sure to specify the IBAN account number (domestic account numbers
do not work with SEPA) and the BIC (bank identifier code) in the
`Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

### Registering payments

You can register any vendor payments made with SEPA. To do so, go to
`Accounting -->
Vendors --> Payments`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. When
creating your payment, select `SEPA Credit Transfer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} as the `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

The first time you pay a vendor with SEPA, you have to fill in the
`Recipient Bank
Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field with the bank name,
IBAN, and BIC (Bank Identifier Code). Odoo automatically verifies if the
IBAN format is respected.

For future payments to this vendor, Odoo will automatically suggest you
the bank account, but it remains possible to select a new one.

Once your payment is registered, do not forget to confirm it. You can
also pay vendor bills from the bill directly using the
`Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top
of a vendor bill. The form is the same, but the payment is directly
linked to the bill and will be automatically reconciled with it.

# Payments

In Odoo, payments can either be automatically linked to an invoice or
bill or be stand-alone records for use at a later date:

- If a payment is **linked to an invoice or bill**, it reduces/settles
  the amount due on the invoice. Multiple payments on the same invoice
  are possible.
- If a payment is **not linked to an invoice or bill**, the customer has
  an outstanding credit with the company, or the company has an
  outstanding debit with a vendor. Those outstanding amounts
  reduce/settle unpaid invoices/bills.

:::

## Registering payment from an invoice or bill {#accounting/payments/from-invoice-bill}

When clicking `Register payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in a
customer invoice or vendor bill, it generates a new journal entry and
changes the amount due according to the payment amount. The counterpart
is reflected in an
`outstanding <bank/outstanding-accounts>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
**receipts** or **payments** account. At this point, the customer
invoice or vendor bill is marked as `In payment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, when the outstanding account is reconciled with
a bank transaction line, the invoice or vendor bill changes to the
`Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status.

The `fa-info-circle`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} information icon
next to the payment line displays more information about the payment. To
access additional information, such as the related journal, click
`View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![See detailed information of a payment.](payments/information-icon.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- The customer invoice or vendor bill must be in the
`Posted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status to register the
payment. - If a payment is unreconciled, it still appears in the books
but is no longer linked to the invoice. - If a payment is (un)reconciled
in a different currency, a journal entry is automatically created to
post the currency exchange gains/losses (reversal) amount. - If a
payment is (un)reconciled and an invoice with cash-basis taxes, a
journal entry is automatically created to post the cash-basis tax
(reversal) amount.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If the main bank account is set as an `outstanding account
<bank/outstanding-accounts>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and the
payment is registered in Odoo (not through a related bank transaction),
invoices and bills are directly registered as `Paid`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

## Registering payments not tied to an invoice or bill {#accounting/payments/not-tied}

When a new payment is registered via
`Customers / Vendors --> Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, it is not directly linked to an invoice or bill.
Instead, the account receivable or the account payable is matched with
the **outstanding account** until it is manually matched with its
related invoice or bill.

### Matching invoices and bills with payments {#accounting/payments/matching-invoices-bills}

A blue banner appears when validating a new invoice/bill and an
**outstanding payment** exists for this specific customer or vendor. To
match it with the invoice or bill, click `ADD`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} under `Outstanding Credits`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Outstanding Debits`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Shows the ADD option to reconcile an invoice or a bill with a payment.](payments/add-option.png)

The invoice or bill is now marked as `In payment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} until it is reconciled with its corresponding bank
transaction.

### Group payments {#accounting/payments/group-payments}

Group payments allow combining outgoing and incoming payments from the
same contact into a single payment to simplify the process and improve
payment usability. To register a group payment:

1.  Go to
    `Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices/Credit Notes`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} or
    `Accounting --> Vendors --> Bills/Refunds`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
2.  Select the relevant invoices/credit notes or bills/refunds linked to
    a specific contact.
3.  Click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
    (`Action menu`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) icon and select
    `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
4.  In the `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window,
    select the `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
    `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
    `Payment Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
5.  Enable the `Group Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    option and click `Create payment`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

The invoices or bills are now marked as `In payment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} until they are reconciled with the corresponding bank
transactions. The credit notes or refunds are marked as
`Paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Batch payments {#accounting/payments/batch-payments}

Batch payments allow grouping payments from multiple contacts to ease
`reconciliation <bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
They are also useful when depositing `checks
<payments/checks>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to the bank or for
`SEPA payments <payments/pay_sepa>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. To do
so, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Batch Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} or `Accounting -->
Vendors --> Batch Payments`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. In
the list view of payments, to group several payments in a batch, select
them and click `Action --> Create Batch Payment`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

all unreconciled customer invoices or vendor bills and allows them to be
processed individually, matching all payments and invoices in one place.
Go to the `Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
click the `fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
(`dropdown menu`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) button from the
`Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or

During the `reconciliation <bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, if the sum of the debits and credits does not match, there
is a remaining balance. This either needs to be reconciled at a later
date or written off directly.
::::

### Batch payments matching {#accounting/payments/batch-payments-matching}

Use the batch reconciliation feature to reconcile several outstanding
payments or invoices simultaneously for a specific customer or vendor.
Go to `Accounting --> Reporting -->
Aged Receivable / Aged Payable`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
All transactions that have not yet been reconciled for that contact are
visible, and when a customer or vendor is selected, the
`Reconcile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is displayed.

![See the reconcile option.](payments/reconcile-option.png)

## Registering a partial payment {#accounting/payments/partial-payment}

To register a partial payment, click on
`Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the related
invoice or bill. In the case of a partial payment (when the
`Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} paid is less than the total
remaining amount on the invoice or the bill), the
`Payment Difference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field displays
the outstanding balance. There are two options:

- `Keep open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Keep the invoice or
  the bill open and mark it with a `Partial`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} banner;
- `Mark as fully paid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select an
  account in the `Post Difference In`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  field and change the `Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if
  needed. A journal entry will be created to balance the accounts
  payable or receivable with the selected account.

![register a partial payment](payments/partial-payment.png)

## Reconciling payments with bank transactions {#accounting/payments/reconciling-payments}

Once a payment has been registered, the status of the invoice or bill is
`In payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The next step is
`reconciling <bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} it
with the related bank transaction line to finalize the payment workflow
and mark the invoice or bill as `Paid`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

# Analytic accounting

Analytic accounting helps you track costs and revenues, as well as
analyze the profitability of a project or service. When creating your
journal entries, the analytic widget allows the distribution of costs in
one or more analytic accounts.

## Configuration

Enable the `Analytic Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
feature by going to `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings --> Analytics`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

## Analytic accounts

The analytic accounts give an overview of your costs and revenue.

Access your existing analytic accounts by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Analytic Accounting: Analytic Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. To create a new analytic account, click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and fill in the required
information:

- `Analytic Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: add the name of
  your analytic account;
- `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the customer
  related to your project;
- `Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: add a reference to
  make it easier to find the account when you are on your bill;
- `Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: add an
  `analytic plan <analytic_accounting/analytic_plans>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"};
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if you are managing
  multiple companies, select the company for which the analytic account
  will be used;
- `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the currency of
  the analytic account;

Then, fill in your `budget <budget>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
information.

## Analytic plans {#analytic_accounting/analytic_plans}

The analytic plans allow you to analyze your accounting. For example, to
track costs and revenues by project or department.

You can access the analytic plans by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Analytic Accounting: Analytic Plans`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
create a new plan.

![create an analytic plan](analytic_accounting/analytic_plans.png){.align-center}

The following information must be completed:

- `Parent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: link your plan to another
  `Analytic Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to build a
  hierarchy between your plans;

- `Default Applicability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: decide how
  your plan behaves in the widget when creating a new journal entry:

  > - `Optional`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if selected, it is
  >   not mandatory to add the analytic plan in the widget;
  > - `Mandatory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if selected, an
  >   orange bullet is visible in the widget next to the plan until the
  >   analytic distribution is done (the bullet then turns to green); it
  >   is not possible to confirm the entry if no analytic account is
  >   selected;
  > - `Unavailable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if selected, the
  >   plan is not available in the widget.

- `Color`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the color of the
  tag related to this specific plan;

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: add the company to which
  the plan applies;

You can also fine-tune your plans\' applicability by filling in the
`Applicability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:

- `Domain`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: choose to which
  accounting document your plan applies;

- `Financial Accounts Prefix`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  the prefix of the account(s) to which this plan should be applied;

- `Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: decide to which
  product category the plan applies;

- 

  `Applicability`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: decide how your plan behaves in the widget when creating a new journal

  :   entry. The applicability you set here always overrides the default
      applicability.

Two smart buttons are available in the top-right corner:

> - `Subplans`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: can be created to
>   have a more complex analytic structure. Click the
>   `Subplans`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button, and then
>   `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add a subplan;
> - `Analytic Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to reach the
>   analytic accounts related to the plan.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- The analytic widget is prefilled based on the applicability, and the
`Analytic Distribution Models <analytic_distribution_models>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}; - Each analytic plan must have at least one analytic
account.
::::

## Analytic distribution

Add a plan in the `Analytic`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column
when creating an invoice or bill. This field is mandatory only if you
previously linked your analytic plan to at least one analytic account.
After adding the plan, a **widget** opens where you can fill in the
different information. You can add **tags** to reflect the related
analytic accounts and decide how to split the costs between the accounts
by modifying the percentage.

![create a distribution template](analytic_accounting/analytic_distribution.png){.align-center}

### Analytic distribution models {#analytic_distribution_models}

The analytic distribution models automatically apply a specific
distribution based on defined criteria.

To create a new analytic distribution model, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Analytic Distribution Models`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and set the conditions
your model has to meet to automatically apply:

- `Accounts Prefix`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this analytic
  distribution will apply to all financial accounts sharing the prefix
  specified;
- `Partner`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select a partner for
  which the analytic distribution will be used;
- `Partner Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field is
  not visible by default: add it by clicking on the columns selection
  button, and tick the `Partner Category`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} box. Add the partner category for which the analytic
  distribution will be used;
- `Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select a product for
  which the analytic distribution will be used;
- `Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field is
  not visible by default: add it by clicking on the columns selection
  button, and tick the `Product Category`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} box. Select a product category for which the analytic
  distribution will be used;
- `Analytic`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: add the analytic
  accounts and their distribution;
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select a company for
  which the analytic distribution will be used;
- `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the
  above conditions are met, the `Analytic plan`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} defined in this field as well as the distribution to
  be applied between the different analytic accounts is selected
  automatically on the entry.

# Analytic budgets

Managing budgets is an essential part of running a business. Budgets
help people become more intentional with how money is spent and direct
people to organize and prioritize their work to meet financial goals.
They allow the planning of a desired financial outcome and then measure
the actual performance against the plan. Odoo manages budgets using both
**general** and **analytic accounts**.

## Configuration

Go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Analytics section`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and enable `Budget Management`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

### Budgetary positions

Budgetary positions are lists of accounts for which you want to keep
budgets (typically expense or income accounts).

To define budgetary positions, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Management:
Budgetary Positions`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Add a `Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to your budgetary position and select the
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} it applies to. Click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add one or more
accounts.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Each budgetary position can have any number of accounts from the chart
of accounts, though it must have at least one.
::::

## Use case

Let's illustrate this with an example.

We just started a project with *Smith & Co*, and we would like to budget
the income and expenses of that project. We plan on having a revenue of
1000, and we don't want to spend more than 700.

First, we need to define what accounts relate to our project's expenses.
Go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Management: Budgetary positions`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to add a position. Add the accounts wherein expenses
will be booked.

![display the Smith and Co expenses](budget/smith-and-co-expenses.png){.align-center}

Let\'s repeat the steps to create a budgetary position that reflects the
revenue.

![display the Smith and Co revenue](budget/smith-and-co-revenue.png){.align-center}

### Analytical accounts

Odoo needs to know which costs or expenses are relevant to a specified
budget, as the above general accounts may be used for different
projects. Go to `Accounting --> Configuration -->
Analytic Accounting: Analytic Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to add a new **Analytic Account** called *Smith & Co*.

The `Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field has to be completed.
Plans group multiple analytic accounts; they distribute costs and
benefits to analyze business performance. **Analytic Plans** can be
created or configured by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Analytic Accounting:
Analytic Plans`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

When creating a new customer invoice and/or vendor bill, you have to
refer to this analytic account.

![add analytic accounts in a new invoice or bill.](budget/analytic-accounts.png){.align-center}

### Define the budget

Let's set our targets. We specified that we expect to gain 1000 with
this project, and we would like not to spend more than 700. Go to
`Accounting --> Management: Budgets`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to create a new budget for *Smith & Co* project.

First, fill in your `Budget Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Then, select the `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} wherein the
budget is applicable. Next, add the
`Budgetary Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} you want to
track, define the related `Analytic Account`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and add the `Planned Amount`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![budget lines display](budget/define-the-budget.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When recording a planned amount related to expenses, the amount must be
negative.
::::

### Check your budget

Go to `Accounting --> Management: Budgets`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and find the *Smith & Co* Project to see how it
evolves according to the expenses or income for the related analytic
account.

The `Practical Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} evolves when a
new journal entry related to your analytic account and an account from
your budgetary position is created.

The `Theoretical Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} represents
the amount of money you theoretically could have spent or should have
received based on the date. For example, suppose your budget is 1200 for
12 months (January to December), and today is 31 of January. In that
case, the theoretical amount will be 100 since this is the actual amount
that could have been made.

# Custom reports

Odoo comes with a powerful and easy-to-use reporting framework. The
engine allows you to create new reports, such as **tax reports**, or
**balance sheets** and **income statements** with **specific groupings**
and **layouts**.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Activate the `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to access the accounting report creation interface.
::::

To create a new report, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Management:
Accounting Reports`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. From here,
you can either create a
`root report <customize-reports/root>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or
a `variant <customize-reports/variants>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

![Accounting reports engine.](customize/engine-accounting-reports.png){.align-center}

## Root reports {#customize-reports/root}

Root reports can be regarded as generic, neutral accounting reports.
They serve as models on which local accounting versions are built. If a
report has no root report, it is considered to be a root report itself.

::: example
A tax report for Belgium and the US would both use the same generic
version as a base and adapt it for their domestic regulations.
:::

When creating a new root report, you need to create a **menu item** for
it. To do so, open the report and then, on that same report, click on
`Action --> Create Menu Item`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Refresh the page; the report is now available under
`Accounting --> Reporting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Cases that require creating a new root report are rare, such as when a
country\'s tax authorities require a new and specific type of report.
::::

![Create Menu Item button.](customize/engine-create-menu-item.png){.align-center}

## Variants {#customize-reports/variants}

Variants are country-specific versions of root reports and, therefore,
always refer to a root report. To create a variant, select a generic
(root) report in the `Root Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field when creating a new report.

When a root report is opened from one of the accounting app\'s main
menus, all its variants are displayed in the variant selector in the top
right corner of the view.

::: example
In the following image, `VAT Report (BE)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is the variant of the root `Generic
Tax report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Report variant selection.](customize/engine-variant.png){.align-center}
:::

## Lines

After having created a report (either root or variant), you need to fill
it with lines. You can either create a new one by clicking on
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or modify an existing
line by clicking on it. All lines *require* a `Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and can have an optional additional
`Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (of your choice) if you wish
to use their value in formulas.

![Engine lines options.](customize/engine-lines-options.png){.align-center}

## Expressions

Each line can contain one or multiple **expressions**. Expressions can
be seen as **sub-variables** needed by a report line. To create an
expression, click on `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
*within* a line report.

When creating an expression, you must attribute a
`label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} used to refer to that
expression. Therefore, it has to be **unique** among the expressions of
each line. Both a `Computation Engine`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and a `Formula`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must
also be indicated. The **engine** defines how your **formula(s)** and
**subformula(s)** are interpreted. It is possible to mix expressions
using different computation engines under the same line if you need to.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Depending on the engine, `subformulas`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} may also be required.
::::

### \'Odoo Domain\' engine

With this engine, a formula is interpreted as an
`Odoo domain <reference/orm/domains>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
targeting [account.move.line]{.title-ref} objects.

The subformula allows you to define how the move lines matching the
domain are used to compute the value of the expression:

[sum]{.title-ref}

:   The result is the sum of all the balances of the matched move lines.

[sum_if_pos]{.title-ref}

:   The result is the sum of all the balances of the matched move lines
    if this amount is positive. Otherwise, it is [0]{.title-ref}.

[sum_if_neg]{.title-ref}

:   The result is the sum of all the balances of the matched move lines
    if this amount is negative. Otherwise, it is [0]{.title-ref}.

[count_rows]{.title-ref}

:   The result is the number of sub-lines of this expression. If the
    parent line has a group-by value, this will correspond to the number
    of distinct grouping keys in the matched move lines. Otherwise, it
    will be the number of matched move lines.

You can also put a [-]{.title-ref} sign at the beginning of the
subformula to **reverse** the sign of the result.

![Expression line within a line report](customize/engine-expressions.png){.align-center}

### \'Tax Tags\' engine

A formula made for this engine consists of a name used to match tax
tags. If such tags do not exist when creating the expression, they will
be created.

When evaluating the expression, the expression computation can roughly
be expressed as: **(amount of the move lines with** [+]{.title-ref}
**tag)** [-]{.title-ref} **(amount of the move lines with**
[-]{.title-ref} **tag)**.

::: example
If the formula is [tag_name]{.title-ref}, the engine matches tax tags
[+tag_name]{.title-ref} and [-tag_name]{.title-ref}, creating them if
necessary. To exemplify further: two tags are matched by the formula. If
the formula is [A]{.title-ref}, it will require (and create, if needed)
tags [+A]{.title-ref} and [-A]{.title-ref}.
:::

### \'Aggregate Other Formulas\' engine

Use this engine when you need to perform arithmetic operations on the
amounts obtained for other expressions. Formulas here are composed of
references to expressions separated by one of the four basic arithmetic
operators (addition [+]{.title-ref}, subtraction [-]{.title-ref},
division [/]{.title-ref}, and multiplication [\*]{.title-ref}). To refer
to an expression, type in its parent line\'s **code** followed by a
period [.]{.title-ref} and the expression\'s **label** (ex.
**code.label**).

**Subformulas** can be one of the following:

[if_above(CUR(amount))]{.title-ref}

:   The value of the arithmetic expression will be returned only if it
    is greater than the provided bound. Otherwise, the result will be
    [0]{.title-ref}.

[if_below(CUR(amount))]{.title-ref}

:   The value of the arithmetic expression will be returned only if it
    is lower than the provided bound. Otherwise, the result will be
    [0]{.title-ref}.

[if_between(CUR1(amount1), CUR2(amount2))]{.title-ref}

:   The value of the arithmetic expression will be returned only if it
    is strictly between the provided bounds. Otherwise, it will be
    brought back to the closest bound.

[if_other_expr_above(LINE_CODE.EXPRESSION_LABEL, CUR(amount))]{.title-ref}

:   The value of the arithmetic expression will be returned only if the
    value of the expression denoted by the provided line code and
    expression label is greater than the provided bound. Otherwise, the
    result will be [0]{.title-ref}.

[if_other_expr_below(LINE_CODE.EXPRESSION_LABEL, CUR(amount))]{.title-ref}

:   The value of the arithmetic expression will be returned only if the
    value of the expression denoted by the provided line code and
    expression label is lower than the provided bound. Otherwise, the
    result will be [0]{.title-ref}.

[CUR]{.title-ref} is the currency code in capital letters, and
[amount]{.title-ref} is the amount of the bound expressed in that
currency.

You can also use the [cross_report]{.title-ref} subformula to match an
expression found in another report.

### \'Prefix of Account Codes\' engine

This engine is used to match amounts made on accounts using the prefixes
of these accounts\' codes as variables in an arithmetic expression.

::: example
\| [21]{.title-ref} \| Arithmetic expressions can also be a single
prefix, such as here.
:::

::: example
\| [21 + 10 - 5]{.title-ref} \| This formula adds the balances of the
move lines made on accounts whose codes start with [21]{.title-ref} and
[10]{.title-ref}, and subtracts the balance of the ones on accounts with
the prefix [5]{.title-ref}.
:::

It is also possible to ignore a selection of sub-prefixes.

::: example
\| [21 + 10(101, 102) - 5(57)]{.title-ref} \| This formula works the
same way as the previous example but ignores the prefixes
[101]{.title-ref}, [102]{.title-ref}, and [57]{.title-ref}.
:::

You can apply \'sub-filtering\' on **credits and debits** using the
[C]{.title-ref} and [D]{.title-ref} suffixes. In this case, an account
will only be considered if its prefix matches, *and* if the total
balance of the move lines made on this account is **credit/debit**.

::: example
Account [210001]{.title-ref} has a balance of -42 and account
[210002]{.title-ref} has a balance of 25. The formula [21D]{.title-ref}
only matches the account [210002]{.title-ref}, and hence returns 25.
[210001]{.title-ref} is not matched, as its balance is *credit*.
:::

Prefix exclusions can be mixed with the [C]{.title-ref} and
[D]{.title-ref} suffixes.

::: example
\| [21D + 10(101, 102)C - 5(57)]{.title-ref} \| This formula adds the
balances of the move lines made on accounts whose code starts with
[21]{.title-ref} *if* it is debit ([D]{.title-ref}) and [10]{.title-ref}
*if* it is credit ([C]{.title-ref}), but ignores prefixes
[101]{.title-ref}, [102]{.title-ref}, and subtracts the balance of the
ones on accounts with the prefix [5]{.title-ref}, ignoring the prefix
[57]{.title-ref}.
:::

To match the letter [C]{.title-ref} or [D]{.title-ref} in a prefix and
not use it as a suffix, use an empty exclusion [()]{.title-ref}.

::: example
\| [21D()]{.title-ref} \| This formula matches accounts whose code
starts with [21D]{.title-ref}, regardless of their balance sign.
:::

In addition to using code prefixes to include accounts, you can also
match them with **account tags**. This is especially useful, for
example, if your country lacks a standardized chart of accounts, where
the same prefix might be used for different purposes across companies.

::: example
\| [tag(25)]{.title-ref} \| This formula matches accounts whose
associated tags contain the one with id *25*.
:::

If the tag you reference is defined in a data file, an xmlid can be used
instead of the id.

::: example
\| [tag(my_module.my_tag)]{.title-ref} \| This formula matches accounts
whose associated tags include the tag denoted by *my_module.my_tag*.
:::

You can also use arithmetic expressions with tags, possibly combining
them with prefix selections.

::: example
\| [tag(my_module.my_tag) + tag(42) + 10]{.title-ref} \| The balances of
accounts tagged as *my_module.my_tag* will be summed with those of
accounts linked to the tag with ID *42* and accounts with the code
prefix [10]{.title-ref}
:::

[C]{.title-ref} and [D]{.title-ref} suffixes can be used in the same way
with tags.

::: example
\| [tag(my_module.my_tag)C]{.title-ref} \| This formula matches accounts
with the tag *my_module.my_tag* and a credit balance.
:::

Prefix exclusion also works with tags.

::: example
\| [tag(my_module.my_tag)(10)]{.title-ref} \| This formula matches
accounts with the tag *my_module.my_tag* and a code not starting with
[10]{.title-ref}.
:::

### \'External Value\' engine

The \'external value\' engine is used to refer to **manual** and
**carryover values**. Those values are not stored using
[account.move.line]{.title-ref}, but with
[account.report.external.value]{.title-ref}. Each of these objects
directly points to the expression it impacts, so very little needs to be
done about their selection here.

**Formulas** can be one of the following:

[sum]{.title-ref}

:   If the result must be the sum of all the external values in the
    period.

[most_recent]{.title-ref}

:   If the result must be the value of the latest external value in the
    period.

In addition, **subformulas** can be used in two ways:

[rounding=X]{.title-ref}

:   Replacing [X]{.title-ref} with a number instructs to round the
    amount to X decimals.

[editable]{.title-ref}

:   Indicates this expression can be edited manually, triggering the
    display of an icon in the report, allowing the user to perform this
    action.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Manual values are created at the [date_to]{.title-ref} currently
selected in the report.
::::

Both subformulas can be mixed by separating them with a [;]{.title-ref}.

::: example
\| [editable;rounding=2]{.title-ref} \| is a correct subformula mixing
both behaviors.
:::

### \'Custom Python Function\' engine

This engine is a means for developers to introduce custom computation of
expressions on a case-by-case basis. The formula is the name of a
**python function** to call, and the subformula is a **key** to fetch in
the **dictionary** returned by this function. Use it only if you are
making a custom module of your own.

## Columns

Reports can have an **indefinite number** of columns to display. Each
column gets its values from the **expressions** declared on the
**lines**. The field `expression_label`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of the column gives the label of the expressions whose
value is displayed. If a line has no **expression** in that field, then
nothing is displayed for it in this column. If multiple columns are
required, you must use different **expression** labels.

![Columns of report.](customize/engine-columns.png){.align-center}

When using the **period comparison** feature found under the
`Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of an accounting
report, all columns are repeated in and for each period.

# Data inalterability check report

Tax authorities in some countries require companies to **prove their
posted accounting entries are inalterable**, meaning that once an entry
has been posted, it can no longer be changed.

To do so, Odoo can use the **SHA-256 algorithm** to create a unique
fingerprint for each posted entry. This fingerprint is called a hash.
The hash is generated by taking an entry\'s essential data (the values
of the [name]{.title-ref}, [date]{.title-ref}, [journal_id]{.title-ref},
[company_id]{.title-ref}, [debit]{.title-ref}, [credit]{.title-ref},
[account_id]{.title-ref}, and [partner_id]{.title-ref} fields),
concatenating it, and inputting it to the SHA-256 hash function, which
then outputs a fixed size (256-bit) string of characters. The hash
function is deterministic (`the
same input always creates the same output`{.interpreted-text
role="dfn"}): any minor modification to the original data would
completely change the resulting hash. Consequently, the SHA-256
algorithm is often used, among others, for data integrity verification
purposes.

In addition, the previous entry\'s hash is always added to the next
entry to form a **hash chain**. This is used to ensure a new entry is
not added afterward between two posted entries, as doing so would break
the hash chain.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Hashes generated by the SHA-256 algorithm are theoretically not unique,
as there is a finite number of possible values. However, this number is
exceptionally high: 2²⁵⁶, which is a lot bigger than the number of atoms
in the known universe. This is why hashes are considered unique in
practice.
::::

## Lock posted entries with hash {#data-inalterability/lock}

To start using the hashing function, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration > Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Open the journal for which you want to activate
the feature, go to the `Advanced Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and enable
`Lock Posted Entries with Hash`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Once you post an entry on a locked journal, you cannot disable the
feature anymore, nor edit any posted entry.
::::

## Report download {#data-inalterability/report}

To download the data inalterability check report, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration
--> Settings --> Reporting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
click on
`Download the Data Inalterability Check Report`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

The report\'s first section is an overview of all your journals and
their configuration. Under the inalterability check column, you can see
whether or not a journal\'s posted entries are locked with a hash (V) or
not (X). The coverage column tells you when a journal\'s posted entries
started being locked.

![Configuration report for two journals](data_inalterability/journal-overview.png){.align-center}

The second section gives you the result of the data consistency check
for each hashed journal. You can view the first hashed entry and its
corresponding hash and the last hashed entry and its corresponding hash.

# Intrastat

Intrastat is the data collection and statistics production system for
goods traded among EU member states. It collects data on:

- Commercial transactions of goods for use, consumption, investment, or
  resale with ownership transfer;
- Goods movements without transfer of ownership (e.g., stock relocations
  or moves of goods before or after outsourced production or processing,
  and after maintenance or repair);
- Returns of goods.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Although the Intrastat system continues to be used, the term Intrastat
is not used in the [latest
legislation](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/2152/2022-01-01),
referring instead to *intra-Union trade in goods statistics*.
::::

::: seealso
[Eurostat Statistics Explained - Glossary:
Intrastat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Intrastat)
:::

## General configuration {#intrastat/general-configuration}

Enable the Intrastat report by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Under the `Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, tick `Intrastat`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and then `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Default transaction codes: invoice and refund {#intrastat/default-transaction-codes}

You can set a default
`transaction code <intrastat/transaction-code>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for all newly created invoice and refund transactions. Under
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select a
`Default invoice transaction code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and/or a `Default refund transaction
code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and then
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The code will be set
automatically on all respective invoice lines.

### Region code {#intrastat/region-code}

The region code is **only used by Belgian companies**. Under
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
select the `Company Intrastat Region`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
where the company is located and then `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If your warehouses are located in more than one region, you can define
the region code at the level of each warehouse instead. To do so, go to
`Inventory --> Configuration -->
Warehouses`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select a warehouse,
set its `Intrastat region`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and then
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Adding the Intrastat region to a warehouse](intrastat/warehouse-region.png){.align-center}
::::

## Product configuration {#intrastat/product-configuration}

All products must be properly configured to be included in the Intrastat
report.

### Commodity code {#intrastat/commodity-code}

Commodity codes are internationally recognized reference numbers used to
classify goods depending on their **nature**. Intrastat uses the
[Combined
Nomenclature](https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/customs-4/calculation-customs-duties/customs-tariff/combined-nomenclature_en).

To add a commodity code, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select a product. Under the
`Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, set the product\'s
`Commodity Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
[National Bank of Belgium - Intrastat commodity
codes](https://www.nbb.be/en/statistics/foreign-trade/nomenclature-and-codes)
:::

### Quantity: weight and supplementary unit {#intrastat/quantity}

Depending on the nature of the goods, it is necessary to specify either
the product\'s weight in kilos (without packaging) or the product\'s
supplementary unit, such as square meter ([m2]{.title-ref}), number of
items ([p/st]{.title-ref}), liter ([l]{.title-ref}), or gram
([g]{.title-ref}).

To add a product\'s weight or supplementary unit, go to
`Accounting --> Customers -->
Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select a product.
Under the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, depending
on the commodity code set, either fill in the product
`Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or its
`Supplementary Units`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Country of origin {#intrastat/origin-country}

To add the product\'s country of origin, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select a product. Under the
`Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, set the
`Country of Origin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Invoices and bills configuration {#intrastat/invoice-bill-configuration}

Once products are properly configured, several settings must be
configured on the invoices and bills you create.

### Transaction code {#intrastat/transaction-code}

Transaction codes are used to identify a transaction\'s nature.
`Default transaction codes
<intrastat/default-transaction-codes>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} can
be set for invoice and refund transactions.

To set a transaction code on an invoice line, create an invoice or a
bill, click the columns selection button, tick
`Intrastat`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and use the newly-added
`Intrastat`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column to select a
transaction code.

![Adding the Intrastat column to an invoice or bill](intrastat/intrastat-column.png){.align-center}

[National Bank of Belgium - Intrastat: Nature of transactions from
January
2022](https://www.nbb.be/doc/dd/onegate/data/new_natures_of_transaction_2022_en.pdf)
:::

### Partner country {#intrastat/partner-country}

The partner country represents the vendor\'s country for bills and the
customer\'s country for invoices. It is automatically filled in using
the country set in the contact\'s `Country`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

To edit the partner country manually, create an invoice or a bill, click
the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and select the
`Intrastat Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Transport code {#intrastat/transport-code}

The transport code identifies the presumed **mode of transport** used to
send the goods (arrival or dispatch).

To add the transport code, create an invoice or a bill, go to the
`Other info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and select the
`Intrastat Transport Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Value of the goods {#intrastat/value}

The value of a good is the untaxed `Subtotal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} (`Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} multiplied
by `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) of an invoice line.

## Partner configuration {#intrastat/partner}

Two fields from the partner\'s contact form are used with Intrastat:
`VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `Country`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The country can be
`manually set <intrastat/partner-country>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
on the invoice or bill.

## Generate the Intrastat report

Generate the report by going to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Audit Reports:
Intrastat Report`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. It is
automatically computed based on the `default configuration
<intrastat/general-configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and the
information found on the `products
<intrastat/product-configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`invoices and bills
<intrastat/invoice-bill-configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
and `partners <intrastat/partner>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Export the report as a PDF, XLSX, or XML file to post it to your legal
administration.

Each report line refers to a single invoice line and contains the
following information:

- Invoice or bill reference number;
- System, which is a code automatically generated depending on whether
  the document is an invoice (dispatch) or a bill (arrival);
- `Country <intrastat/partner-country>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
  which is the vendor\'s country for arrivals and the customer\'s
  country for dispatches;
- `Transaction Code <intrastat/transaction-code>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"};
- (If your company is located in Belgium)
  `Region Code <intrastat/region-code>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"};
- `Commodity Code <intrastat/commodity-code>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"};
- `Origin Country <intrastat/origin-country>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"};
- `Partner VAT <intrastat/partner>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"};
- `Transport Code <intrastat/transport-code>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"};
- `Incoterm Code <../customer_invoices/incoterms>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"};
- `Weight <intrastat/quantity>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"};
- `Supplementary Units <intrastat/quantity>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}; and
- `Value <intrastat/value>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, which is
  always expressed in euros even if the original invoice or bill used
  another currency.

# Tax carryover

When performing tax reports, the **tax carryover** feature allows
carrying amounts from one period to another without creating new
entries.

It has been created to meet the legal requirements of specific
locations, where amounts must be transferred from period to period (for
example, because the total of the line is negative).

The feature is activated by default in countries where it is required,
such as Belgium, France, and Italy. There is no specific configuration
required.

Let's take an example of a Belgian company that created a credit note of
100 for one of their customers. The due tax is 21%.

![Illustration with a credit note](tax_carryover/belgian-example.png){.align-center}

In this case, as per local regulation, grid 81 of the tax report may
contain a negative amount. But it must be declared to the government as
zero, and the negative amount should be carried over to the next period.

If we go to
`Accounting app --> Reporting --> Tax Report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, a pop-up on line 81 explains that the amount will
be carried over in the next period.

![pop-up message stating the amount will be carried over to the next period](tax_carryover/pop-up.png){.align-center}

At the time of the tax closing period, the tax report shows that the
amount was carried over from the previous period. It also indicates the
amount that will be carried over to this line in the next period based
on the existing transactions and the carryover from the previous period.

![Illustration of the tax return](tax_carryover/tax-return.png){.align-center}




--- SOURCE: finance/accounting/reporting/tax_returns.md ---

# Tax return (VAT declaration)

Companies with a registered `VAT (Value Added Tax)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} number must submit a **tax return** on a monthly or
quarterly basis, depending on their turnover and the registration
regulation. A tax return - or VAT return - gives the tax authorities
information about the taxable transactions made by the company. The
**output tax** is charged on the number of goods and services sold by a
business, while the **input tax** is the tax added to the price when
goods or services are purchased. Based on these values, the company can
calculate the tax amount they have to pay or be refunded.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

You can find additional information about VAT and its mechanism on this
page from the European Commission: [\"What is
VAT?\"](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/what-is-vat_en).
::::

## Prerequisites {#tax-returns/prerequisites}

### Tax Return Periodicity {#tax-returns/periodicity}

The configuration of the **Tax Return Periodicity** allows Odoo to
compute your tax return correctly and also to send you a reminder to
never miss a tax return deadline.

To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Under the
`Tax Return Periodicity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, you can
set:

- `Periodicity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: define here whether
  you submit your tax return on a monthly or quarterly basis;
- `Reminder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: define when Odoo should
  remind you to submit your tax return;
- `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the journal in
  which to record the tax return.

![Configure how often tax returns have to be made in Odoo Accounting](tax_returns/tax_return_periodicity.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This is usually configured during the
`app's initial set up <../get_started>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
::::

### Tax Grids {#tax-returns/tax-grids}

Odoo generates tax reports based on the `Tax Grids`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} settings that are configured on your taxes. Therefore,
it is crucial to make sure that all recorded transactions use the right
taxes. You can see the `Tax Grids`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} by
opening the `Journal Items`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of
any invoice and bill.

![see which tax grids are used to record transactions in Odoo Accounting](tax_returns/tax_return_grids.png){.align-center}

To configure your tax grids, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and open the tax you want to modify. There, you
can edit your tax settings, along with the tax grids that are used to
record invoices or credit notes.

![Configure taxes and their tax grids in Odoo Accounting](tax_returns/tax_return_taxes.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Taxes and reports are usually already pre-configured in Odoo: a
`fiscal localization package
<fiscal_localizations/packages>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is
installed according to the country you select at the creation of your
database.
::::

## Close a tax period {#tax-returns/close}

### Tax Lock Date {#tax-returns/lock-date}

Any new transaction whose accounting date prior to the
`Tax Lock Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} has its tax values
moved to the next open tax period. This is useful to make sure that no
change can be made to a report once its period is closed.

Therefore, we recommend locking your tax date before working on your
`Closing Journal Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This way,
other users cannot modify or add transactions that would have an impact
on the `Closing Journal Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which
can help you avoid some tax declaration errors.

To check the current `Tax Lock Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
or to edit it, go to
`Accounting --> Accounting --> Actions: Lock Dates`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![Lock your tax for a specific period in Odoo Accounting](tax_returns/tax_return_lock.png){.align-center}

### Tax Report {#tax-returns/report}

Once all the transactions involving taxes have been posted for the
period you want to report, open the `Tax Report`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} by going to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select the period you want to declare using the
date filter to have an overview of the tax report. From the report,
click `PDF`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`XLSX`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to download the desired format
of the tax report, or click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
save the report to the Documents app. The report includes all the values
to report to the tax authorities, along with the amount to be paid or
refunded.

![download the PDF with your Tax Report in Odoo Accounting](tax_returns/tax_return_report.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If you forgot to lock your tax date before clicking on
`Closing Journal Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then Odoo
automatically locks your fiscal period on the same date as the
accounting date of your entry. This safety mechanism can prevent some
fiscal errors, but it is advised to lock your tax date manually before,
as described above.

# Year-end closing

Year-end closing is vital for maintaining financial accuracy, complying
with regulations, making informed decisions, and ensuring transparency
in reporting.

## Fiscal years {#year-end/fiscal-years}

By default, the fiscal year is set to last 12 months and end on December
31st. However, its duration and end date can vary due to cultural,
administrative, and economic considerations.

To modify these values, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Under the `Fiscal Periods`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, change the `Last Day`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field if necessary.

If the period lasts *more* than or *less* than 12 months, enable
`Fiscal Years`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Go back to the
`Fiscal Periods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section and click
`➜ Fiscal
Years`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. From there, click
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, give it a
`Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and both a
`Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Once the set fiscal period is over, Odoo automatically reverts to the
default periodicity, taking into account the value specified in the
`Last Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
::::

## Year-end checklist {#year-end/checklist}

### Before closure

Before closing a fiscal year, ensure first everything is accurate and
up-to-date:

- Make sure all bank accounts are fully
  `reconciled <../bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} up
  to year-end, and confirm that the ending book balances match the bank
  statement balances.
- Verify that all
  `customer invoices <../customer_invoices>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} have been entered and approved and that there are no draft
  invoices.
- Confirm that all `vendor bills  <../vendor_bills>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} have been entered and agreed upon.
- Validate all `expenses <../../expenses>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, ensuring their accuracy.
- Corroborate that all
  `received payments <../payments>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} have
  been encoded and recorded accurately.
- Close all
  `suspense accounts <bank_accounts/suspense>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- Book all `depreciation <../vendor_bills/assets>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and `deferred revenue
  <../customer_invoices/deferred_revenues>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} entries.

### Closing a fiscal year

Then, to close the fiscal year:

- Run a `tax report <reporting/tax-report>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, and verify that all tax information is correct.
- Reconcile all accounts on the
  `balance sheet <reporting/balance-sheet>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}:
  - Update the bank balances in Odoo according to the actual balances
    found on the bank statements.
  - Reconcile all transactions in the cash and bank accounts by running
    the `aged receivables
    <reporting/aged-receivable>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
    `aged payables <reporting/aged-payable>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} reports.
  - Audit all accounts, being sure to fully understand all transactions
    and their nature, making sure to include loans and fixed assets.
  - Optionally, run
    `payments matching <accounting/payments/matching>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} to validate any open vendor bills and customer invoices
    with their payments. While this step is optional, it could assist
    the year-end closing process if all outstanding payments and
    invoices are reconciled, potentially finding errors or mistakes in
    the system.

Next, the accountant likely verifies balance sheet items and book
entries for:

> - year-end manual adjustments,
> - work in progress,
> - depreciation journal entries,
> - loans,
> - tax adjustments,
> - etc.

If the accountant is going through the year-end audit, they may want to
have paper copies of all balance sheet items (such as loans, bank
accounts, prepayments, sales tax statements, etc.) to compare these with
the balances in Odoo.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

During this process, it is good practice to set a
`Journal Entries Lock Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the
last day (inclusive) of the preceding fiscal year by going to
`Accounting -->
Accounting --> Lock Dates`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. This
way, the accountant can be confident that nobody changes the
transactions while auditing the books. Users from the *accountant*
access group can still create and modify entries.
::::

#### Current year\'s earnings

Odoo uses a unique account type called **current year\'s earnings** to
display the amount difference between the **income** and **expenses**
accounts.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The chart of accounts can only contain one account of this type. By
default, it is a 999999 account named
`Undistributed Profits/Losses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

To allocate the current year\'s earnings, create a miscellaneous entry
to book them to any equity account. Once done, confirm whether or not
the current year\'s earnings in the **balance sheet** is correctly
reporting a balance of zero. If that is the case, set an
`All Users Lock Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the last day
of the fiscal year by going to `Accounting --> Accounting --> Lock
Dates`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Install the `Irreversible Lock Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
([account_lock]{.title-ref}) module to make the `All
Users Lock Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} *irreversible* once
set.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

A specific year-end closing entry is **optional** in order to close out
the **profit and loss statement**. The reports are created in real-time,
meaning that the profit and loss statement corresponds directly with the
year-end date specified in Odoo. Therefore, any time the **income
statement** is generated, the beginning date corresponds with the
beginning of the **fiscal year** and all account balances should equal
zero.

# B2B (tax excluded) and B2C (tax included) pricing

When working with consumers, prices are usually expressed with taxes
included in the price (e.g., in most eCommerce). But, when you work in a
B2B environment, companies usually negotiate prices with taxes excluded.

Odoo manages both use cases easily, as long as you register your prices
on the product with taxes excluded or included, but not both together.
If you manage all your prices with tax included (or excluded) only, you
can still easily do sales order with a price having taxes excluded (or
included) : that\'s easy.

This documentation is only for the specific use case where you need to
have two references for the price (tax included or excluded), for the
same product. The reason of the complexity is that there is not a
symmetrical relationship with prices included and prices excluded, as
shown in this use case, in Belgium with a tax of 21%:

- Your eCommerce has a product at **10€ (taxes included)**
- This would do **8.26€ (taxes excluded)** and a **tax of 1.74€**

But for the same use case, if you register the price without taxes on
the product form (8.26€), you get a price with tax included at 9.99€,
because:

- **8.26€ \* 1.21 = 9.99€**

So, depending on how you register your prices on the product form, you
will have different results for the price including taxes and the price
excluding taxes:

- Taxes Excluded: **8.26€ & 10.00€**
- Taxes Included: **8.26€ & 9.99€**

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If you buy 100 pieces at 10€ taxes included, it gets even more tricky.
You will get: **1000€ (taxes included) = 826.45€ (price) + 173.55€
(taxes)** Which is very different from a price per piece at 8.26€ tax
excluded.
::::

This documentation explains how to handle the very specific use case
where you need to handle the two prices (tax excluded and included) on
the product form within the same company.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In terms of finance, you have no more revenues selling your product at
10€ instead of 9.99€ (for a 21% tax), because your revenue will be
exactly the same at 9.99€, only the tax is 0.01€ higher. So, if you run
an eCommerce in Belgium, make your customer a favor and set your price
at 9.99€ instead of 10€. Please note that this does not apply to 20€ or
30€, or other tax rates, or a quantity \>1. You will also make you a
favor since you can manage everything tax excluded, which is less error
prone and easier for your salespeople.
::::

## Configuration

### Introduction

The best way to avoid this complexity is to choose only one way of
managing your prices and stick to it: price without taxes or price with
taxes included. Define which one is the default stored on the product
form (on the default tax related to the product), and let Odoo compute
the other one automatically, based on the pricelist and fiscal position.
Negotiate your contracts with customers accordingly. This perfectly
works out-of-the-box and you have no specific configuration to do.

If you can not do that and if you really negotiate some prices with tax
excluded and, for other customers, others prices with tax included, you
must:

1.  always store the default price **tax excluded** on the product form,
    and apply a tax (price excluded on the product form)
2.  create a pricelist with prices in **tax included**, for specific
    customers
3.  create a fiscal position that switches the tax excluded to a tax
    included
4.  assign both the pricelist and the fiscal position to customers who
    want to benefit to this pricelist and fiscal position

For the purpose of this documentation, we will use the above use case:

- your product default sale price is 8.26€ tax excluded
- but we want to sell it at 10€, tax included, in our shops or eCommerce
  website

### eCommerce {#b2b_b2c/ecommerce}

If you only use B2C or B2B prices on your website, simply select the
appropriate setting in the **Website** app settings.

If you have both B2B and B2C prices on a single website, please follow
these instructions:

1.  Activate the `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and go to `General Settings
    --> Users & Companies --> Groups`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
2.  Open either [Technical / Tax display B2B]{.title-ref} or [Technical
    / Tax display B2C]{.title-ref}.
3.  Under the `Users`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, add the
    users requiring access to the price type. Add B2C users in the B2C
    group and B2B users in the B2B group.

### Setting your products

Your company must be configured with tax excluded by default. This is
usually the default configuration, but you can check your **Default Sale
Tax** from the menu `Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} of the Accounting application.

![image](B2B_B2C/price_B2C_B2B01.png){.align-center}

Once done, you can create a **B2C** pricelist. You can activate the
pricelist feature per customer from the menu:
`Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} of
the Sale application. Choose the option **different prices per customer
segment**.

Once done, create a B2C pricelist from the menu
`Configuration --> Pricelists`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
It\'s also good to rename the default pricelist into B2B to avoid
confusion.

Then, create a product at 8.26€, with a tax of 21% (defined as tax not
included in price) and set a price on this product for B2C customers at
10€, from the `Sales --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} menu of the Sales application:

![image](B2B_B2C/price_B2C_B2B02.png){.align-center}

### Setting the B2C fiscal position

From the accounting application, create a B2C fiscal position from this
menu: `Configuration --> Fiscal Positions`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. This fiscal position should map the VAT 21% (tax
excluded of price) with a VAT 21% (tax included in price)

![image](B2B_B2C/price_B2C_B2B03.png){.align-center}

## Test by creating a quotation

Create a quotation from the Sale application, using the
`Sales --> Quotations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} menu. You
should have the following result: 8.26€ + 1.73€ = 9.99€.

![image](B2B_B2C/price_B2C_B2B04.png){.align-center}

Then, create a quotation but **change the pricelist to B2C and the
fiscal position to B2C** on the quotation, before adding your product.
You should have the expected result, which is a total price of 10€ for
the customer: 8.26€ + 1.74€ = 10.00€.

![image](B2B_B2C/price_B2C_B2B05.png){.align-center}

This is the expected behavior for a customer of your shop.

## Avoid changing every sale order

If you negotiate a contract with a customer, whether you negotiate tax
included or tax excluded, you can set the pricelist and the fiscal
position on the customer form so that it will be applied automatically
at every sale of this customer.

The pricelist is in the **Sales & Purchases** tab of the customer form,
and the fiscal position is in the accounting tab.

Note that this is error prone: if you set a fiscal position with tax
included in prices but use a pricelist that is not included, you might
have wrong prices calculated for you. That\'s why we usually recommend
companies to only work with one price reference.

# AvaTax use

AvaTax is a tax calculation software that can be integrated with Odoo in
the United States and Canada. Once the
`integration setup <../avatax>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} is
complete, the calculated tax is simple and automatic.

## Tax calculation

Automatically calculate taxes on Odoo quotations and invoices with
AvaTax by confirming the documents during the sales flow. Alternatively,
calculate the taxes manually by clicking the
`Compute taxes using Avatax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
while these documents are in draft mode.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Clicking the `Compute taxes using Avatax`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button recalculates taxes if any product lines are
edited on the invoice.
::::

![Sales quotation with the confirm and compute taxes using AvaTax buttons highlighted.](avatax_use/calculate-avatax.png){.align-center}

The tax calculation is triggered during the following `automatic trigger
<avatax/automatic-triggers>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`manual trigger <avatax/manual-triggers>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
circumstances.

### Automatic triggers {#avatax/automatic-triggers}

- When the sales rep sends the quote by email with
  `Send by email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button (pop-up).
- When the customer views the online quote on the portal.
- When a quote is confirmed and becomes a sales order.
- When the customer views the invoice on the portal.
- When a draft invoice is validated.
- When the customer views the subscription in the portal.
- When a subscription generates an invoice.
- When the customer gets to the last screen of the eCommerce checkout.

### Manual triggers {#avatax/manual-triggers}

- `Compute taxes using Avatax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
  at the bottom of the quote.
- `Compute taxes using Avatax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
  at the top of the invoice.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Use the `Avalara Partner Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
that is available on customer records, quotations, and invoices to
cross-reference data in Odoo and AvaTax. This field is located under the
`Other info`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} tab of the sales
order or quotation in the `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section.

On the customer record, navigate to *Contacts app* and select a contact.
Then open the `Sales & Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
and the `Avalara Partner Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under
the `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.
::::

:::: important

Important
:::

The `Automatic Tax Mapping (AvaTax)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
fiscal position is also applied on those Odoo documents, like
subscriptions.
::::

::: seealso
\- `../fiscal_positions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## AvaTax synchronization

Synchronization occurs with AvaTax, when the *invoice* is created in
Odoo. This means the sales tax is recorded with Avalara (AvaTax software
developer).

To do so, navigate to
`Sales app --> Orders --> Quotations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select a quotation from the list.

After confirming a quotation and validating the delivery, click
`Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Indicate whether it
is a `Regular invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Down payment (percentage)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Down payment (fixed amount)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then click `Create and view invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
The recorded taxes can be seen in the `Journal Items`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of the invoice. There will be different taxes
depending on the location of the `Delivery Address`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Journal items highlighted on a invoice in Odoo.](avatax_use/journal-items.png){.align-center}

Finally, press the `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
to complete the invoice and synchronize with the AvaTax portal.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

An invoice cannot be `Reset to draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
because this causes de-synchronization with the AvaTax Portal. Instead,
click `Add credit note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and state:
[Sync with AvaTax Portal]{.title-ref}. See this documentation:
`../../../accounting/customer_invoices/credit_notes`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
::::

## Fixed price discounts

Add a fixed price discount to a valuable customer by click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the customer\'s
invoice. Add the product discount and set the `Price`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to either a positive or negative value. To recalculate
the taxes, click `Compute taxes using Avatax`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Tax calculation can even be done on negative subtotals and credit notes.
::::

## Logging

It is possible to log Avalara/\*AvaTax\* actions in Odoo for further
analysis, or verification of functionality. Logging is accessible
through the *AvaTax* settings.

To start logging *AvaTax* actions, first, navigate to the
`Accounting app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Then, in the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, under
the `AvaTax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} settings, click
`Start logging for 30 minutes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Upon starting the log process, Odoo will log all Avalara/\*AvaTax\*
actions performed in the database.

To view the logs, click on `Show logs`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to the right of the `Start logging for 30
minutes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This reveals a detailed
list of Avalara/\*AvaTax\* actions. This list is sortable by the
following columns:

- `Created on`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: timestamp of the
  *AvaTax* calculation.
- `Created by`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: numeric value of the
  user in the database.
- `Database name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: name of the
  database.
- `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: two values can be chosen
  for this field, `Server`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Client`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Avalara service name. In
  this case, it will be *AvaTax*.
- `Level`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: by default, this will be
  [INFO]{.title-ref}.
- `Path`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: indicates the path taken to
  make the calculation.
- `Line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: indicates the line the
  calculation is made on.
- `Function`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: indicates the
  calculation taken on the line.

![Avalara logging page with top row of list highlighted.](avatax_use/logging.png){.align-center}

Click into the log line to reveal another field, called
`Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

This field populates a raw transcription of the transaction, which
involves the creation (or adjustment) of a sales invoice using the
Avalara *AvaTax* API.

The transaction includes details, such as addresses for shipping from
and to, line items describing the products or services, tax codes, tax
amounts, and other relevant information.

The `Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} contains the calculated
taxes for different jurisdictions and confirms the creation (or
adjustment) of the transaction.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Custom fields can be made using Odoo *Studio*. Click the
`fa-ellipsis-v`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(ellipsis)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu to the far-right of
the header row. Then click `fa-plus`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Add custom field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This action opens
Odoo *Studio*.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo *Studio* requires a *custom* pricing plan. Consult the database\'s
customer success manager for more information on switching plans. Or to
see if Odoo *Studio* is included in the database\'s current pricing
plan. See this documentation: `../../../../studio`{.interpreted-text

# AvaTax integration

Avalara\'s *AvaTax* is a cloud-based tax software. Integrating *AvaTax*
with Odoo provides real-time and region-specific tax calculations when
users sell, purchase, and invoice items in Odoo. *AvaTax* tax
calculation is supported with every United Nations charted country,
including inter-border transactions.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

*AvaTax* is only available for integration with databases/companies that
have locations in the United States and Canada. This means the fiscal
position/country of a database can only be set to the United States or
Canada. For more information, reference this documentation:
`avatax/fiscal_country`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

*AvaTax* accounts for location-based tax rates for each state, county,
and city. It improves remittance accuracy by paying close attention to
laws, rules, jurisdiction boundaries, and special circumstances (like,
tax holidays, and product exemptions). Companies who integrate with
*AvaTax* can maintain control of tax-calculations in-house with this
simple `API (application
programming interface)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} integration.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Some limitations exist in Odoo while using *AvaTax* for tax calculation:

- *AvaTax* is **not** supported in Odoo\'s *Point of Sale* app, because
  a dynamic tax calculation model is excessive for transactions within a
  single delivery address, such as stores or restaurants.
- *AvaTax* and Odoo use the company address and **not** the warehouse
  address.
- Exercise tax is **not** supported. This includes tobacco/vape taxes,
  fuel taxes, and other specific industries.

:::

## Set up on AvaTax

To use *AvaTax*, an account with Avalara is required for the setup. If
one has not been set up yet, connect with Avalara to purchase a license:
[Avalara: Let\'s Talk](https://www.avalara.com/us/en/get-started.html).

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Upon account setup, take note of the *AvaTax*
`Account ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This will be needed in
the `Odoo setup <avatax/credentials>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. In
Odoo, this number is the `API ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

Then, [create a basic company
profile](https://community.avalara.com/support/s/document-item?bundleId=dqa1657870670369_dqa1657870670369&topicId=Create_a_Basic_company_profile.html&_LANG=enus).

### Create basic company profile

Collect essential business details for the next step: locations where
tax is collected, products/services sold (and their sales locations),
and customer tax exemptions, if applicable. Follow the Avalara
documentation for creating a basic company profile:

1.  [Add company
    information](https://community.avalara.com/support/s/document-item?bundleId=dqa1657870670369_dqa1657870670369&topicId=Add_your_company_information.html&_LANG=enus).
2.  [Tell us where the company collects and pays
    tax](https://community.avalara.com/support/s/document-item?bundleId=dqa1657870670369_dqa1657870670369&topicId=Tell_us_where_you_collect_and_pay_tax.html&_LANG=enus).
3.  [Verify jurisdictions and activate the
    company](https://community.avalara.com/support/s/document-item?bundleId=dqa1657870670369_dqa1657870670369&topicId=Verify_your_jurisdictions_and_activate_your_company.html&_LANG=enus).
4.  [Add other company locations for location-based
    filing](https://community.avalara.com/support/s/document-item?bundleId=dqa1657870670369_dqa1657870670369&topicId=Add_other_company_locations_for_location-based_filing.html&_LANG=enus).
5.  [Add a marketplace to the company
    profile](https://community.avalara.com/support/s/document-item?bundleId=dqa1657870670369_dqa1657870670369&topicId=Add_marketplace_transactions_to_your_company_profile.html&_LANG=enus).

### Connect to AvaTax {#avatax/create_avalara_credentials}

After creating the basic company profile in Avalara, connect to
*AvaTax*. This step links Odoo and *AvaTax* bidirectionally.

Navigate to either Avalara\'s
[sandbox](https://sandbox.admin.avalara.com/) or
[production](https://admin.avalara.com/) environment. This will depend
on which type of Avalara account the company would like to integrate.

::: seealso
[Sandbox vs production environments in
Avalara](https://knowledge.avalara.com/bundle/fzc1692293626742/page/sandbox-vs-production.html).
:::

Log in to create the `License Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Go to `Settings --> License and API
Keys`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Click
`Generate License Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

A warning appears stating: [If your business app is connected to Avalara
solutions, the connection will be broken until you update the app with
the new license key. This action cannot be undone.]{.title-ref}

Generating a new license key breaks the connection with existing
business apps using the *AvaTax* integration. Make sure to update these
apps with the new license key.
::::

If this will be the first
`API (application programming interface)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
integration being made with *AvaTax* and Odoo, then click
`Generate license key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If this is an additional license key, ensure the previous connection can
be broken. There is **only** one license key associated with each of the
Avalara sandbox and production accounts.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Copy this key to a safe place. It is **strongly encouraged** to backup
the license key for future reference. This key cannot be retrieved after
leaving this screen.
::::

## Odoo configuration

Before using *AvaTax*, there are some additional configurations in Odoo
to ensure tax calculations are made accurately.

Verify that the Odoo database contains necessary data. The country
initially set up in the database determines the fiscal position, and
aids *AvaTax* in calculating accurate tax rates.

### Fiscal country {#avatax/fiscal_country}

To set the `Fiscal Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, navigate
to `Accounting app --> Configuration
--> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

::: seealso
`../../fiscal_localizations`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

Under the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, set the
`Fiscal Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature to `United
States`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Canada`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Company settings

All companies operating under the Odoo database should have a full and
complete address listed in the settings. Navigate to the
`Settings app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and under the
`Companies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, ensure there is
only one company operating the Odoo database. Click
`Update Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open a separate page
to update company details.

If there are multiple companies operating in the database, click
`Manage Companies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to load a list of
companies to select from. Update company information by clicking into
the specific company.

Database administrators should ensure that the
`Street...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Street2...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `State`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are all updated for the
companies.

This ensures accurate tax calculations and smooth end-of-year accounting
operations.

Should *AvaTax* be needed for Odoo *Subscriptions*, or for delivery tax
in Odoo *eCommerce*, then install those modules individually by clicking
on `Install`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Odoo AvaTax settings {#avatax/credentials}

To integrate the *AvaTax*
`API (application programming interface)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
with Odoo, go to
`Accounting app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} section. The `AvaTax`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} fields in the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section is where the *AvaTax* configurations are made
and the credentials are entered in.

![Configure AvaTax settings](avatax/avatax-configuration-settings.png){.align-center}

#### Prerequisites

First, select the `Environment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
which the company wishes to use *AvaTax* in. It can either be
`Sandbox`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
For help determining which *AvaTax* environment to use (either
`Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Sandbox`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), visit: [Sandbox vs
Production
environments](https://knowledge.avalara.com/bundle/fzc1692293626742/page/sandbox-vs-production.html).
:::

#### Credentials

Now, the credentials can be entered in. The *AvaTax*
`Account ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should be entered in the
`API ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and the
`License Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should be entered in
the `API
Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Account ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be found by
logging into the *AvaTax* portal
([sandbox](https://sandbox.admin.avalara.com/) or
[production](https://admin.avalara.com/)). In the upper-right corner,
click on the initials of the user and `Account`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The `Account ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
listed first.

To access the `License Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} see this
documentation: `avatax/create_avalara_credentials`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

For the `Company Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, enter
the Avalara company code for the company being configured. Avalara
interprets this as [DEFAULT]{.title-ref}, if it is not set. The
`Company Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be accessed in the
Avalara management portal.

First, log into the *AvaTax* portal
([sandbox](https://sandbox.admin.avalara.com/) or
[production](https://admin.avalara.com/)). Then, navigate to
`Settings --> Manage Companies`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
The `Company Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} value is located
in the row of the `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Company Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

![AvaTax company code highlighted on the company details page.](avatax/company-code.png){.align-center}

#### Transaction options

There are two transactional settings in the Odoo *AvaTax* settings that
can be configured: `Use UPC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Commit Transactions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If the checkbox next to `Use UPC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
ticked, the transactions will use Universal Product Codes (UPC), instead
of custom defined codes in Avalara. Consult a certified public
accountant (CPA) for specific guidance.

Should the `Commit Transactions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox be ticked, then, the transactions in the Odoo database will be
committed for reporting in *AvaTax*.

#### Address validation

The *Address Validation* feature ensures that the most up-to-date
address by postal standards is set on a contact in Odoo. This is
important to provide accurate tax calculations for customers.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Address Validation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature only
works with partners/customers in North America.
::::

Additionally, tick the checkbox next to the
`Address validation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

For accurate tax calculations, it is best practice to enter a complete
address for the contacts saved in the database. However, *AvaTax* can
still function by implementing a best effort attempt using only the
`Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `State`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `Zip code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
These are the three minimum required fields.
::::

`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the settings to implement the
configuration.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Manually `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the address by
navigating to the `Contacts app`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and selecting a contact. Now that the *AvaTax*

previously. This only occurs upon tax calculation.
::::

#### Test connection

After entering all the above information into the *AvaTax* setup on
Odoo, click `Test
connection`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This ensures the
`API ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`API KEY`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are correct, and a
connection is made between Odoo and the *AvaTax* application programming
interface (API).

#### Sync parameters

Upon finishing the configuration and settings of the *AvaTax* section,
click the `Sync
Parameters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. This action
synchronizes the exemption codes from *AvaTax*.

### Fiscal position {#avatax/fiscal_positions}

Next, navigate to
`Accounting app --> Configuration --> Accounting: Fiscal
Positions`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. A
`Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is listed named,
`Automatic Tax Mapping
(AvaTax)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click it to open
*AvaTax\'s* fiscal position configuration page.

Here, ensure that the `Use AvaTax API`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox is ticked.

Optionally, tick the checkbox next to the field labeled:
`Detect Automatically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Should this
option be ticked, then, Odoo will automatically apply this
`Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for transactions in
Odoo.

Enabling `Detect Automatically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} also
makes specific parameters, such as `VAT
required`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Foreign Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Country Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Federal States`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Zip Range`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appear. Filling these
parameters filters the `Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} usage. Leaving them blank ensures all calculations are
made using this `Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Should the `Detect Automatically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
checkbox not be ticked, each customer will need to have the
`Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set on their

contact record. To do so, navigate to
`Sales app --> Order --> Customers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, or `Contacts app --> Contacts`{.interpreted-text

are set for smooth end-of-year record keeping. Consult a certified
public accountant (CPA) for specific guidance on setting both accounts.

Click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to implement the
changes.

### Tax mapping

The *AvaTax* integration is available on sale orders and invoices with
the included *AvaTax* fiscal position.

#### Product category mapping

Before using the integration, specify an
`Avatax Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the product
categories. Navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Product Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select the product category to add the
`AvaTax Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to. In the
`AvaTax Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, select a

# Cash basis taxes

Cash basis taxes are due when the payment is made, as opposed to
standard taxes that are due when the invoice is confirmed. Reporting
your income and expenses to the government based on the cash basis
method is mandatory in some countries and under some conditions.

::: example
You sell a product in the 1st quarter of your fiscal year, and the
payment is received in the 2nd quarter. Based on the cash basis method,
the tax you must pay is for the 2nd quarter.
:::

## Configuration

Go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and under the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, enable `Cash Basis`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Then, define the `Tax Cash Basis Journal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Click on the external link button next to the journal
to update its default properties such as the
`Journal Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Short Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Select your Tax Cash Basis Journal and click on the external link](cash_basis/tax_cash_basis_journal.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

By default, the journal entries of the
`Cash Basis Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} journal are named
using the `CABA`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} short code.
::::

Once this is done, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Accounting: Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to configure your taxes. You can either
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} a new tax or update an
existing one by clicking on it.

The `Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column reflects the
proper transitional accounts to post taxes until the payment is
registered.

![Fill in the account column with a transitional accounts where taxes go until the payment
is registered](cash_basis/account_column.png){.align-center}

In the `Advanced Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, decide
of the `Tax Exigilibity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Select
`Based on Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, so the tax is due
when the payment of the invoice is received. You can then also define
the `Cash Basis Transition Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
where the tax amount is recorded as long as the original invoice has not
been reconciled.

![Fill in the Cash Basis Transition Account where taxes amounts go until payment
reconciliation.](cash_basis/advanced_options.png){.align-center}

## Impact of cash basis taxes on accounting

To illustrate the impact of cash basis taxes on accounting transactions,
let\'s take an example with the sales of a product that costs 1,000\$,
with a cash basis tax of 15%.

![](cash_basis/customer_invoice_with_cbt.png){.align-center}

The following entries are created in your accounting, and the tax report
is currently empty.

+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Customer journal (INV)**                                  |
+==============================+==============================+
| **Debit**                    | **Credit**                   |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
| Receivable \$1,150           |                              |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
|                              | Income \$1,000               |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
|                              | Temporary tax account \$150  |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+

When the payment is then received, it is registered as below :

+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Bank journal (BANK)**                                     |
+==============================+==============================+
| **Debit**                    | **Credit**                   |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
| Bank \$1,150                 |                              |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
|                              | Receivable \$1,150           |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Once the payment is registered, you can use the
`Cash Basis Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button on
the invoice to access them directly.
::::

Finally, upon reconciliation of the invoice with the payment, the below
entry is automatically created:

+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Tax Cash Basis Journal (Caba)**                           |
+==============================+==============================+
| **Debit**                    | **Credit**                   |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
| Income account \$1,000       |                              |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
| Temporary tax account \$150  |                              |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
|                              | > Income account \$1,000     |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
|                              | Tax Received \$150           |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+

The journal items `Income account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
vs. `Income account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are neutral, but
they are needed to ensure correct tax reports in Odoo with accurate base
tax amounts.

Using a default `Base Tax Received Account`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is recommended so your balance is at zero and your
income account is not polluted by unnecessary accounting movements. To
do so, go to `Configuration --> Settings --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select a
`Base Tax Received Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under
`Cash Basis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# EU intra-community distance selling

EU intra-community distance selling involves the cross-border trade of
goods and services from vendors registered for VAT purposes to
individuals (B2C) located in a European Union member state. The
transaction is conducted remotely, typically through online platforms,
mail orders, telephone, or other means of communication.

EU intra-community distance selling is subject to specific VAT rules and
regulations. The vendor must charge VAT per the VAT rate applicable in
the buyer\'s country.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This remains applicable even if the vendor is located outside of the
European Union.
::::

## Configuration

The **EU Intra-community Distance Selling** feature helps you comply
with this regulation by creating and configuring new **fiscal
positions** and **taxes** based on your company\'s country. To enable
it, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, tick
`EU Intra-community Distance Selling`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![EU intra-community Distance Selling feature in Odoo Accounting settings](eu_distance_selling/enable-feature.png)

## One-Stop Shop (OSS)

The `OSS (One-Stop Shop)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} system
introduced by the European Union simplifies VAT collection for
**cross-border** sales of goods and services. It primarily applies to
business-to-consumer **(B2C)** cases. With the OSS, businesses can
register for VAT in their home country and use a single online portal to
handle VAT obligations for their sales within the EU. There are **two
primary schemes**: the **Union OSS** scheme for cross-border services
and the **Import OSS** scheme for goods valued at or below €150.

### Reports

To generate **OSS sales** or **OSS imports** reports and submit them
onto the OSS portal, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click `Report: Generic Tax
report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select either
`OSS Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`OSS Imports`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Once selected, click
on `PDF`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `XLSX`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `XML`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
top-left corner. This generates the currently-opened report in the
selected format. Once generated, log into the platform of your competent
federal authority to submit it onto the OSS portal.

# Fiscal positions (tax and account mapping)

Default taxes and accounts are set on products and customers to create
new transactions on the fly. However, depending on the customers\' and
providers\' localization and business type, using different taxes and
accounts for a transaction might be necessary.

**Fiscal positions** allow the creation of rules to adapt the taxes and
accounts used for a transaction automatically.

They can be applied
`automatically <fiscal_positions/automatic>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `manually
<fiscal_positions/manual>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, or
`assigned to a partner <fiscal_positions/partner>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Several default fiscal positions are available as part of your
`fiscal localization
package <fiscal_localizations/packages>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
::::

## Configuration

> 

### Tax and account mapping

To edit or create a fiscal position, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Fiscal
Positions`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and open the entry
to modify or click on `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The mapping of taxes and accounts is based on the default taxes and
accounts defined in the product form.

- To map to another tax or account, fill out the right column
  (`Tax to Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}/
  `Account to Use Instead`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

![Example of a fiscal position\'s tax mapping](fiscal_positions/fiscal-positions-tax-mapping.png){.align-center}

![Example of a fiscal position\'s account mapping](fiscal_positions/fiscal-positions-account-mapping.png){.align-center}

- To remove a tax, leave the field `Tax to Apply`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} empty.
- To replace a tax with several other taxes, add multiple lines using
  the same `Tax on
  Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The mapping only works with *active* taxes. Therefore, make sure they
are active by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

## Application

### Automatic application {#fiscal_positions/automatic}

To automatically apply a fiscal position following a set of conditions,
go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Fiscal Positions`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, open the fiscal position to modify, and tick
`Detect Automatically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

From there, several conditions can be activated:

- `VAT Required`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the customer\'s VAT
  number must be present on their contact form.
- `Country Group`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the fiscal position is
  only applied to the selected country or country group.

![Example of a fiscal position automatic application settings](fiscal_positions/fiscal-positions-automatic.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Taxes on **eCommerce orders** are automatically updated once the
customer has logged in or filled out their billing details.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The fiscal positions\' **sequence** defines which fiscal position is
applied if all conditions set on multiple fiscal positions are met
simultaneously.

For example, suppose the first fiscal position in a sequence targets
*country A* while the second fiscal position targets a *country group*
that comprises *country A*. In that case, only the first fiscal position
will be applied to customers from *country A*.
::::

### Manual application {#fiscal_positions/manual}

To manually select a fiscal position, open a sales order, invoice, or
bill, go to the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and
select the desired `Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
before adding product lines.

![Selection of a fiscal position on a sales order, invoice, or bill](fiscal_positions/fiscal-positions-manual.png){.align-center}

### Assign to a partner {#fiscal_positions/partner}

To define which fiscal position must be used by default for a specific
partner, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Customers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select the partner, open the
`Sales & Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and select
the `Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Withholding taxes

A withholding tax, also called a retention tax, is a government
requirement for the payer of a customer invoice to withhold or deduct
tax from the payment, and pay that tax to the government. In most
jurisdictions, withholding tax applies to employment income.

With normal taxes, the tax is added to the subtotal to give you the
total to pay. As opposed to normal taxes, withholding taxes are deducted
from the amount to pay, as the tax will be paid by the customer.

As, an example, in Colombia you may have the following invoice:

![image](retention/retention03.png){.align-center}

In this example, the **company** who sent the invoice owes \$20 of taxes
to the **government** and the **customer** owes \$10 of taxes to the
**government**.

## Configuration

In Odoo, a withholding tax is defined by creating a negative tax. For a
retention of 10%, you would configure the following tax (accessible
through `Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}):

![image](retention/retention04.png){.align-center}

In order to make it appear as a retention on the invoice, you should set
a specific tax group **Retention** on your tax, in the **Advanced
Options** tab.

![image](retention/retention02.png){.align-center}

Once the tax is defined, you can use it in your products, sales order or
invoices.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If the retention is a percentage of a regular tax, create a Tax with a
**Tax Computation** as a **Tax Group** and set the two taxes in this
group (normal tax and retention).
::::

## Applying retention taxes on invoices

Once your tax is created, you can use it on customer forms, sales order
or customer invoices. You can apply several taxes on a single customer
invoice line.

![image](retention/retention01.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When you see the customer invoice on the screen, you get only a **Taxes
line** summarizing all the taxes (normal taxes & retentions). But when
you print or send the invoice, Odoo does the correct grouping amongst
all the taxes.
::::

The printed invoice will show the different amounts in each tax group.

# TaxCloud integration

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

The Odoo TaxCloud integration has begun its decommissioning, starting in
Odoo 17. New installations are prohibited in Odoo 17. In Odoo 18, the
TaxCloud module(s) will **not** exist at all. Odoo recommends the use of
the Avatax platform, instead.
::::

::: seealso
`avatax`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

TaxCloud calculates the sales tax rate in real time for every state,
city, and special jurisdiction in the United States. It keeps track of
which products are exempt from sales tax, and in which states each
exemption applies.

## TaxCloud registration

Register an account on [TaxCloud.com](https://taxcloud.com/register) and
complete the setup. Once you go live, get the
`TaxCloud API Keys`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} by clicking on
`Stores`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then
`Get Details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Example of a store\'s TaxCloud API Keys](taxcloud/taxcloud-api-keys.png){.align-center}

## Enable TaxCloud

1.  Go to
    `Accounting Dashboard --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and in the `Taxes`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} section enable `TaxCloud`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

2.  Add the store\'s `Login ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under
    `API ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the store\'s
    `Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under
    `API KEY`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click on
    `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

3.  Click the `Refresh`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
    (`🗘`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) next to
    `Default Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to import the
    TIC `Taxability Information Codes`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}
    product categories from TaxCloud. Some categories may imply specific
    tax rates or exemptions.

4.  Select a `Default Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
    `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
    `Default Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is applied
    when no `TaxCloud Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
    set on your products or product categories, or when no product is
    found on an order/invoice.

    ![Filling in TaxCloud API Keys in Odoo](taxcloud/taxcloud-settings.png){.align-center}

## Set TaxCloud categories on products

If you need to use more than one TIC category (i.e., the
`Default Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), go to the
product\'s `General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
and select a `TaxCloud Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If you want to configure multiple products simultaneously, ensure they
share the same `Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
click on the external link button (`🡕`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}) to set a `TaxCloud Category`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the `Product Category`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} instead.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If you set a `TaxCloud Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on a
product and another on its `Product
Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, Odoo only considers the
`TaxCloud Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} found on the
product itself.

A `TaxCloud Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set on a
**parent product category** does not apply to its **child product
categories**. For example, if you set
`TaxCloud Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the *All*
`Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, it is not applied
to the *All/Sales* `Product Category`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Make sure your company address is complete, including the state and the
ZIP code. Go to `Settings --> Companies: Update Info`{.interpreted-text

## Automatically post taxes in the correct tax payable account

To make sure the new taxes generated by the TaxCloud integration are
created with the correct **Tax Payable** account, create a
**user-defined default**. This process should be repeated for each one
of your companies that uses TaxCloud.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

A user-defined default impacts all records at creation. It means that
**every** new tax is set up to record income in the specified Tax
Payable account unless the tax is manually edited to specify a different
income account (or if another user-defined default takes precedence).
::::

To do so, go to
`Accounting Dashboard --> Configuration --> Accounting: Chart of
Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, find the company\'s
`Tax Payable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} account, and click on
`Setup`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Take note of the number
after [id=]{.title-ref} in the URL string; it is the **Tax Payable
account ID** and will be used later.

## Automatically detect the fiscal position

Sales taxes are calculated in Odoo based on
`fiscal positions <fiscal_positions>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. A
fiscal position for the United States is created when enabling TaxCloud.

You can configure Odoo to automatically detect to which customers the
fiscal position should be applied. To do so, go to
`Accounting Dashboard --> Configuration --> Accounting:
Fiscal Positions`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select
`Automatic Tax Mapping (TaxCloud)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Enable `Detect
Automatically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and then
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Detect Automatically setting on the TaxCloud fiscal position](taxcloud/fiscal-position-detect.png){.align-center}

Now, this fiscal position is automatically set on any order or invoice
if the customer country is *United States*. This triggers the automated
tax computation.

:::: note

To get the sales taxes on a sales order, confirm it or click the
`Update Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to
`Add Shipping`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

## Interaction with coupons and promotions

If you use the **Coupon** or **Promotion Programs**, the integration
with TaxCloud might behave unexpectedly. Indeed, as TaxCloud does not
accept lines with negative amounts as part of the tax computation, the
amount of the lines added by the promotion program must be deduced from
the total of the lines it impacts.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

This means, amongst other complications, that orders using coupons or
promotions with a TaxCloud fiscal position **must** be invoiced
completely - you cannot create invoices for partial deliveries, etc.
::::

Another unexpected behavior is possible. For example, you sell a product
for which you have a promotion program that provides a 50% discount. If
the product\'s tax rate is 7%, the tax rate computed from the TaxCloud
integration displays 3.5%. This happens because the discount is included
in the price sent to TaxCloud. However, in Odoo, the discount is on
another line entirely. Still, the tax computation is correct. Indeed, a
3.5% tax on the full price is the equivalent of a 7% tax on half the
price, but this might be unexpected from a user point of view.

# VAT numbers verification (VIES)

**VAT Information Exchange System** - abbreviated **VIES** - is a tool
provided by the European Commission that allows you to check the
validity of VAT numbers of companies registered in the European Union.

Odoo provides a feature to **Verify VAT Numbers** when you save a
contact. This helps you make sure that your contacts provided you with a
valid VAT number without leaving Odoo interface.

## Configuration

To enable this feature, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, enable the **Verify VAT Numbers** feature, and
click on *Save*.

![Enable \"Verify VAT Numbers\" in Odoo Accounting](vat_verification/vat-validation-configuration.png){.align-center}

## VAT Number validation

Whenever you create or modify a contact, make sure to fill out the
**Country** and **VAT** fields.

![Fill out the contact form with the country and VAT number before clicking on \*Save\*](vat_verification/vat-validation-contact-form.png){.align-center}

When you click on *Save*, Odoo runs a VIES VAT number check, and
displays an error message if the VAT number is invalid.

![Odoo displays an error message instead of saving when the VAT number is invalid](vat_verification/vat-validation-error.png){.align-center}

# Taxes

There are numerous types of **taxes**, and their application varies
greatly, depending mostly on your company\'s localization. To make sure
they are recorded with accuracy, Odoo\'s tax engine supports all kinds
of uses and computations.

## Default taxes {#taxes/default}

**Default Taxes** define which taxes are automatically selected when
there is no other indication about which tax to use. For example, Odoo
prefills the **Taxes** field with the Default Taxes when you create a
new product or add a new line on an invoice.

![Odoo fills out the Tax field automatically according to the Default Taxes](taxes/default-invoice-line.png)

To change your **Default Taxes**, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings
--> Taxes --> Default Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
select the appropriate taxes for your default **Sales Tax** and
**Purchase Tax**, and click on *Save*.

![Define which taxes to use by default on Odoo](taxes/default-configuration.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Default Taxes** are automatically set up according to the country
selected at the creation of your database, or when you set up a
`fiscal localization package
<fiscal_localizations/packages>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for your
company.
::::

## Activate Sales Taxes from the List view {#taxes/list_activation}

As part of your
`fiscal localization package <fiscal_localizations/packages>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, most of your country\'s sales taxes are already
preconfigured on your database. However, only a few of them are
activated by default, so that you can activate only the ones relevant
for your business.

To activate Sale Taxes, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and use the *Activate* toggle button to activate
or deactivate a tax.

![Activate pre-configured taxes in Odoo Accounting](taxes/list.png)

## Configuration {#taxes/configuration}

To edit or create a **Tax**, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and open a tax or click on *Create*.

![Edition of a tax in Odoo Accounting](taxes/edit.png)

::::: {#taxes/labels}
:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Taxes have three different labels, each one having a specific use. Refer
to the following table to see where they are displayed.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `Tax Name                         `Label on Invoice                           `Tax Group
  <taxes/name>`{.interpreted-text   <taxes/label-invoices>`{.interpreted-text   <taxes/tax-group>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}                       role="ref"}                                 role="ref"}

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
::::
:::::

### Basic Options

#### Tax Name {#taxes/name}

The **Tax Name** as you want to display it for backend users. This is
the `label
<taxes/labels>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} you see while editing
Sales Orders, Invoices, Products, etc.

#### Tax Computation {#taxes/computation}

- **Group of Taxes**

  The tax is a combination of multiple sub-taxes. You can add as many
  taxes you want, in the order you want them to be applied.

  :::: important
  ::: title
  Important
  :::

  Make sure that the tax sequence is correct, as the order in which they
  are may impact the taxes\' amounts computation, especially if one of
  the taxes `affects the base of the
  subsequent ones <taxes/base-subsequent>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
  ::::

- **Fixed**

  The tax has a fixed amount in the default currency. The amount remains
  the same, regardless of the Sales Price.

  For example, a product has a Sales Price of \$1000, and we apply a
  *\$10 fixed* tax. We then have:

    -------------------------------------------------
    Product\'s    Price without Tax        Total
    Sales Price   tax                      
    ------------- ------------- ---------- ----------
    1,000         1,000         10         1,010.00

    -------------------------------------------------

- **Percentage of Price**

  The *Sales Price* is the taxable basis: the tax\'s amount is computed
  by multiplying the Sales Price by the tax\'s percentage.

  For example, a product has a Sales Price of \$1000, and we apply a
  *10% of Price* tax. We then have:

    -------------------------------------------------
    Product\'s    Price without Tax        Total
    Sales Price   tax                      
    ------------- ------------- ---------- ----------
    1,000         1,000         100        1,100.00

    -------------------------------------------------

- **Percentage of Price Tax Included**

  The *Total* is the taxable basis: the tax\'s amount is a percentage of
  the Total.

  For example, a product has a Sales Price of \$1000, and we apply a
  *10% of Price Tax Included* tax. We then have:

    -------------------------------------------------
    Product\'s    Price without Tax        Total
    Sales Price   tax                      
    ------------- ------------- ---------- ----------
    1,000         1,000         111.11     1,111.11

    -------------------------------------------------

#### Active {#taxes/active}

Only **Active** taxes can be added to new documents.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

It is not possible to delete taxes that have already been used. Instead,
you can deactivate them to prevent future use.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This field can be modified from the *List View*. See
`above <taxes/list_activation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for more
information.
::::

#### Tax Scope {#taxes/scope}

The **Tax Scope** determines the tax\'s application, which also
restricts where it is displayed.

- **Sales**: Customer Invoices, Product\'s Customer Taxes, etc.
- **Purchase**: Vendor Bills, Product\'s Vendor Taxes, etc.
- **None**

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can use **None** for taxes that you want to include in a
`Group of Taxes
<taxes/computation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} but that you don\'t
want to list along with other Sales or Purchase taxes.
::::

### Definition tab {#taxes/definition-tab}

Allocate with precision the amount of the taxable basis or percentages
of the computed tax to multiple accounts and Tax Grids.

![Allocate tax amounts to the right accounts and tax grids](taxes/definition.png)

- **Based On**:
  - Base: the price on the invoice line
  - \% of tax: a percentage of the computed tax.
- **Account**: if defined, an additional Journal Item is recorded.
- **Tax Grids**: used to generate
  `Tax Reports <reporting/tax_returns>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
  automatically, according to your country\'s regulations.

### Advanced Options tab {#taxes/advanced-tab}

#### Label on Invoices {#taxes/label-invoices}

The label of the tax, as displayed on each invoice line in the **Taxes**
column. This is the `label <taxes/labels>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
visible to *front end* users, on exported invoices, on their Customer
Portals, etc.

![The Label on Invoices is displayed on each invoice line](taxes/invoice-label.png)

#### Tax Group {#taxes/tax-group}

Select to which **Tax Group** the tax belongs. The Tax Group name is the
`label
<taxes/labels>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} displayed above the
*Total* line on exported invoices, and the Customer Portals.

Tax groups include different iterations of the same tax. This can be
useful when you must record differently the same tax according to
`Fiscal Positions <taxes/fiscal_positions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

![The Tax Group name is different from the Label on Invoices](taxes/invoice-tax-group.png)

In the example above, we see a 0% tax for Intra-Community customers in
Europe. It records amounts on specific accounts and with specific tax
grids. Still, to the customer, it is a 0% tax. That\'s why the
`Label on the Invoice <taxes/label-invoices>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} indicates *0% EU*, and the Tax Group name, above the *Total*
line, indicates *0%*.

#### Include in Analytic Cost {#taxes/analytic-cost}

With this option activated, the tax\'s amount is assigned to the same
**Analytic Account** as the invoice line.

#### Included in Price {#taxes/included-in-price}

With this option activated, the total (including the tax) equals the
**Sales Price**.

`Total = Sales Price = Computed Tax-Excluded price + Tax`{.interpreted-text
role="dfn"}

For example, a product has a Sales Price of \$1000, and we apply a *10%
of Price* tax, which is *included in the price*. We then have:

  -------------------------------------------------
  Product\'s    Price without Tax        Total
  Sales Price   tax                      
  ------------- ------------- ---------- ----------
  1,000         900.10        90.9       1,000.00

  -------------------------------------------------

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If you need to define prices accurately, both tax-included and
tax-excluded, please refer to the following documentation:
`taxes/B2B_B2C`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- **Invoices**: By default, the Line Subtotals displayed on your
invoices are *Tax-Excluded*. To display *Tax-Included* Line Subtotals,
go to `Accounting --> Configuration -->
Settings --> Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and select *Tax-Included* in the **Line Subtotals Tax Display** field,
then click on *Save*. - **eCommerce**: By default, the prices displayed
on your eCommerce website are *Tax-Excluded*. To display *Tax-Included*
prices, go to `Website --> Configuration --> Settings
--> Pricing`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select
*Tax-Included* in the **Product Prices** field, then click on *Save*.
::::

#### Affect Base of Subsequent Taxes {#taxes/base-subsequent}

With this option, the total tax-included becomes the taxable basis for
the other taxes applied to the same product.

You can configure a new
`Group of Taxes <taxes/computation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to
include this tax, or add it directly to a product line.

![The eco-tax is taken into the basis of the 21% VAT tax](taxes/subsequent-line.png)

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

The order in which you add the taxes on a product line has no effect on
how amounts are computed. If you add taxes directly on a product line,
only the tax sequence determines the order in which they are applied.

To reorder the sequence, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and drag and drop the lines with the handles next
to the tax names.

# Non-current assets and fixed assets

**Non-current Assets**, also known as **long-term assets**, are
investments that are expected to be realized after one year. They are
capitalized rather than being expensed and appear on the company\'s
balance sheet. Depending on their nature, they may undergo
**depreciation**.

**Fixed Assets** are a type of Non-current Assets and include the
properties bought for their productive aspects, such as buildings,
vehicles, equipment, land, and software.

For example, let\'s say we buy a car for \$ 27,000. We plan to amortize
it over five years, and we will sell it for \$ 7,000 afterward. Using
the linear, or straight-line, depreciation method, \$ 4,000 are expensed
each year as **depreciation expenses**. After five years, the
**Accumulated Depreciation** amount reported on the balance sheet equals
\$ 20,000, leaving us with \$ 7,000 of **Not Depreciable Value**, or
Salvage value.

Odoo Accounting handles depreciation by creating all depreciation
entries automatically in *draft mode*. They are then posted
periodically.

Odoo supports the following **Depreciation Methods**:

- Straight Line
- Declining
- Declining Then Straight Line

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The server checks once a day if an entry must be posted. It might then
take up to 24 hours before you see a change from *draft* to *posted*.
::::

## Prerequisites

Such transactions must be posted on an **Assets Account** rather than on
the default expense account.

### Configure an Assets Account

To configure your account in the **Chart of Accounts**, go to
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click on *Create*, and fill out the form.

![Configuration of an Assets Account in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets01.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This account\'s type must be either *Fixed Assets* or *Non-current
Assets*.
::::

### Post an expense to the right account

#### Select the account on a draft bill

On a draft bill, select the right account for all the assets you are
buying.

![Selection of an Assets Account on a draft bill in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets02.png){.align-center}

#### Choose a different Expense Account for specific products {#product-assets-account}

Start editing the product, go to the *Accounting* tab, select the right
**Expense Account**, and save.

![Change of the Assets Account for a product in Odoo](assets/assets03.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

It is possible to
`automate the creation of assets entries <assets-automation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for these products.
::::

#### Change the account of a posted journal item {#journal-assets-account}

To do so, open your Purchases Journal by going to
`Accounting --> Accounting -->
Purchases`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select the journal
item you want to modify, click on the account, and select the right one.

![Modification of a posted journal item\'s account in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets04.png){.align-center}

## Assets entries

### Create a new entry {#create-assets-entry}

An **Asset entry** automatically generates all journal entries in *draft
mode*. They are then posted one by one at the right time.

To create a new entry, go to
`Accounting --> Accounting --> Assets`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click on *Create*, and fill out the form.

Click on **select related purchases** to link an existing journal item
to this new entry. Some fields are then automatically filled out, and
the journal item is now listed under the **Related Purchase** tab.

![Assets entry in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets05.png){.align-center}

Once done, you can click on *Compute Depreciation* (next to the
*Confirm* button) to generate all the values of the **Depreciation
Board**. This board shows you all the entries that Odoo will post to
depreciate your asset, and at which date.

![Depreciation Board in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets06.png){.align-center}

#### What does \"Prorata Temporis\" mean?

The **Prorata Temporis** feature is useful to depreciate your assets the
most accurately possible.

With this feature, the first entry on the Depreciation Board is computed
based on the time left between the *Prorata Date* and the *First
Depreciation Date* rather than the default amount of time between
depreciations.

For example, the Depreciation Board above has its first depreciation
with an amount of \$ 241.10 rather than \$ 4,000.00. Consequently, the
last entry is also lower and has an amount of \$ 3758.90.

#### What are the different Depreciation Methods

The **Straight Line Depreciation Method** divides the initial
Depreciable Value by the number of depreciations planned. All
depreciation entries have the same amount.

The **Declining Depreciation Method** multiplies the Depreciable Value
by the **Declining Factor** for each entry. Each depreciation entry has
a lower amount than the previous entry. The last depreciation entry
doesn\'t use the declining factor but instead has an amount
corresponding to the balance of the depreciable value so that it reaches
\$0 by the end of the specified duration.

The **Declining Then Straight Line Depreciation Method** uses the
Declining Method, but with a minimum Depreciation equal to the Straight
Line Method. This method ensures a fast depreciation at the beginning,
followed by a constant one afterward.

### Assets from the Purchases Journal

You can create an asset entry from a specific journal item in your
**Purchases Journal**.

To do so, open your Purchases Journal by going to
`Accounting --> Accounting -->
Purchases`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select the
journal item you want to record as an asset. Make sure that it is posted
in the right account (see: `journal-assets-account`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}).

Then, click on *Action*, select **Create Asset**, and fill out the form
the same way you would do to
`create a new entry <create-assets-entry>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

![Create Asset Entry from a journal item in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets07.png){.align-center}

## Modification of an Asset

You can modify the values of an asset to increase or decrease its value.

To do so, open the asset you want to modify, and click on *Modify
Depreciation*. Then, fill out the form with the new depreciation values
and click on *Modify*.

A **decrease in value** posts a new Journal Entry for the **Value
Decrease** and modifies all the future *unposted* Journal Entries listed
in the Depreciation Board.

An **increase in value** requires you to fill out additional fields
related to the account movements and creates a new Asset entry with the
**Value Increase**. The Gross Increase Asset Entry can be accessed with
a Smart Button.

![Gross Increase smart button in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets08.png){.align-center}

## Disposal of Fixed Assets

To **sell** an asset or **dispose** of it implies that it must be
removed from the Balance Sheet.

To do so, open the asset you want to dispose of, click on *Sell or
Dispose*, and fill out the form.

![Disposal of Assets in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets09.png){.align-center}

Odoo Accounting then generates all the journal entries necessary to
dispose of the asset, including the gain or loss on sale, which is based
on the difference between the asset\'s book value at the time of the
sale and the amount it is sold for.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To record the sale of an asset, you must first post the related Customer
Invoice so you can link the sale of the asset with it.
::::

## Assets Models

You can create **Assets Models** to create your Asset entries faster. It
is particularly useful if you recurrently buy the same kind of assets.

To create a model, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Assets Models`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click on *Create*, and fill out the form the same
way you would do to create a new entry.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can also convert a *confirmed Asset entry* into a model by opening
it from `Accounting --> Accounting --> Assets`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and then, by clicking on the button *Save Model*.
::::

### Apply an Asset Model to a new entry

When you create a new Asset entry, fill out the **Fixed Asset Account**
with the right asset account.

New buttons with all the models linked to that account appear at the top
of the form. Clicking on a model button fills out the form according to
that model.

![Assets model button in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets10.png){.align-center}

## Automate the Assets {#assets-automation}

When you create or edit an account of which the type is either
*Non-current Assets* or *Fixed Assets*, you can configure it to create
assets for the expenses that are credited on it automatically.

You have three choices for the **Automate Assets** field:

1.  **No:** this is the default value. Nothing happens.
2.  **Create in draft:** whenever a transaction is posted on the
    account, a draft *Assets entry* is created, but not validated. You
    must first fill out the form in `Accounting -->
    Accounting --> Assets`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
3.  **Create and validate:** you must also select an Asset Model (see:
    [Assets Models](#assets-models)). Whenever a transaction is posted
    on the account, an *Assets entry* is created and immediately
    validated.

![Automate Assets on an account in Odoo Accounting](assets/assets11.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title

You can, for example, select this account as the default **Expense
Account** of a product to fully automate its purchase. (see:
`product-assets-account`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).

# Deferred expenses and prepayments

**Deferred expenses** and **prepayments** (also known as **prepaid
expense**), are both costs that have already occurred for unconsumed
products or services yet to receive.

Such costs are **assets** for the company that pays them since it
already paid for products and services still to receive or that are yet
to be used. The company cannot report them on the current **Profit and
Loss statement**, or *Income Statement*, since the payments will be
effectively expensed in the future.

These future expenses must be deferred on the company\'s balance sheet
until the moment in time they can be **recognized**, at once or over a
defined period, on the Profit and Loss statement.

For example, let\'s say we pay \$ 1200 at once for one year of
insurance. We already pay the cost now but haven\'t used the service
yet. Therefore, we post this new expense in a *prepayment account* and
decide to recognize it on a monthly basis. Each month, for the next 12
months, \$ 100 will be recognized as an expense.

Odoo Accounting handles deferred expenses and prepayments by spreading
them in multiple entries that are automatically created in *draft mode*
and then posted periodically.

:::: note
::: title

The server checks once a day if an entry must be posted. It might then

Start editing the product, go to the *Accounting* tab, select the right
**Expense Account**, and save.

![Change of the Expense Account for a product in Odoo](deferred_expenses/deferred_expenses03.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

It is possible to automate the creation of expense entries for these
products (see: [Automate the Deferred
Expenses](#automate-the-deferred-expenses)).
::::

#### Change the account of a posted journal item

To do so, open your Purchases Journal by going to
`Accounting --> Accounting -->
Purchases`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select the journal
item you want to modify, click on the account, and select the right one.

![Modification of a posted journal item\'s account in Odoo Accounting](deferred_expenses/deferred_expenses04.png){.align-center}

## Deferred Expenses entries

### Create a new entry

A **Deferred Expense entry** automatically generates all journal entries
in *draft mode*. They are then posted one by one at the right time until
the full amount of the expense is recognized.

To create a new entry, go to
`Accounting --> Accounting --> Deferred Expense`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click on *Create*, and fill out the form.

Click on **select related purchases** to link an existing journal item
to this new entry. Some fields are then automatically filled out, and
the journal item is now listed under the **Related Expenses** tab.

![Deferred Expense entry in Odoo Accounting](deferred_expenses/deferred_expenses05.png){.align-center}

Once done, you can click on *Compute Deferral* (next to the *Confirm*
button) to generate all the values of the **Expense Board**. This board
shows you all the entries that Odoo will post to recognize your expense,
and at which date.

![Expense Board in Odoo Accounting](deferred_expenses/deferred_expenses06.png){.align-center}

#### What does \"Prorata Temporis\" mean?

The **Prorata Temporis** feature is useful to recognize your expense the
most accurately possible.

With this feature, the first entry on the Expense Board is computed
based on the time left between the *Prorata Date* and the *First
Recognition Date* rather than the default amount of time between
recognitions.

For example, the Expense Board above has its first expense with an
amount of \$ 70.97 rather than \$ 100.00. Consequently, the last entry
is also lower and has an amount of \$ 29.03.

### Deferred Entry from the Purchases Journal

You can create a deferred entry from a specific journal item in your
**Purchases Journal**.

To do so, open your Purchases Journal by going to
`Accounting --> Accounting -->
Purchases`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select the
journal item you want to defer. Make sure that it is posted in the right
account (see: [Change the account of a posted journal
item](#change-the-account-of-a-posted-journal-item)).

Then, click on *Action*, select **Create Deferred Entry**, and fill out
the form the same way you would do to [create a new
entry](#create-a-new-entry).

![Create Deferred Entry from a journal item in Odoo Accounting](deferred_expenses/deferred_expenses07.png){.align-center}

## Deferred Expense Models

You can create **Deferred Expense Models** to create your Deferred
Expense entries faster.

To create a model, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Deferred Expense Models`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, click on *Create*, and fill out the form the same
way you would do to create a new entry.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can also convert a *confirmed Deferred Expense entry* into a model
by opening it from
`Accounting --> Accounting --> Deferred Expenses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and then, by clicking on the button *Save Model*.
::::

### Apply a Deferred Expense Model to a new entry

When you create a new Deferred Expense entry, fill out the **Deferred
Expense Account** with the right recognition account.

New buttons with all the models linked to that account appear at the top
of the form. Clicking on a model button fills out the form according to
that model.

![Deferred Expense model button in Odoo Accounting](deferred_expenses/deferred_expenses08.png){.align-center}

## Automate the Deferred Expenses {#deferred-expenses-automation}

When you create or edit an account of which the type is either *Current
Assets* or *Prepayments*, you can configure it to defer the expenses
that are credited on it automatically.

You have three choices for the **Automate Deferred Expense** field:

1.  **No:** this is the default value. Nothing happens.
2.  **Create in draft:** whenever a transaction is posted on the
    account, a draft *Deferred Expenses entry* is created, but not
    validated. You must first fill out the form in
    `Accounting --> Accounting --> Deferred Expenses`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
3.  **Create and validate:** you must also select a Deferred Expense
    Model (see: [Deferred Expense Models](#deferred-expense-models)).
    Whenever a transaction is posted on the account, a *Deferred
    Expenses entry* is created and immediately validated.

![Automate Deferred Expense on an account in Odoo Accounting](deferred_expenses/deferred_expenses09.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can, for example, select this account as the default **Expense
Account** of a product to fully automate its purchase. (see: [Choose a
different Expense Account for specific
products](#choose-a-different-expense-account-for-specific-products)).

# AI-powered document digitization

**Invoice digitization** is the process of converting paper documents
into vendor bill and customer invoice forms in your accounting.

Odoo uses `OCR (optical character recognition)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and artificial intelligence technologies to recognize the
content of the documents. Vendor bill and customer invoice forms are
automatically created and populated based on the scanned invoices.

::: seealso
\- [Test Odoo\'s invoice
digitization](https://www.odoo.com/app/invoice-automation) - [Odoo
Tutorials: Vendor Bill
Digitization](https://www.odoo.com/slides/slide/vendor-bill-digitization-7065)
:::

## Configuration

In
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Digitization`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, check the box
`Document Digitization`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and choose
whether `Vendor Bills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (this includes
customer credit notes) should be processed automatically or on demand.

If you enable the `Single Invoice Line Per Tax`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option, only one line is created per tax in the new
bill, regardless of the number of lines on the invoice.

## Invoice upload

### Upload invoices manually

From the `Accounting Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
click on the `Upload`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button of your
vendor bills journal. Alternatively, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} or
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Bills`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select `Upload`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

### Upload invoices using an email alias {#invoice-digitization/email-alias}

You can configure your connected scanner to send scanned documents to an
email alias. Emails sent to these aliases are converted into new draft
customer invoices or vendor bills.

You can modify the email alias of a journal. To do so, go to the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app. Under
`General Settings: Discuss`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, enable
`Custom Email Servers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, add an
`Alias Domain`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The email alias is now available in the
`Advanced Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
journal. Emails sent to this address will be converted automatically
into new invoices or bills.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If you use the
`Documents </applications/productivity/documents>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} app, you can automatically send your scanned invoices to the
`Finance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} workspace (e.g.,
[inbox-financial@example.odoo.com]{.title-ref}).
::::

The default email aliases [vendor-bills@]{.title-ref} and
[customer-invoices@]{.title-ref} followed by the
`Alias Domain`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} you set are
automatically created for the `Vendor Bills`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} journals, respectively. Emails sent to these addresses
are converted automatically into new invoices or bills.

To change a default email alias, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Accounting: Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Select the journal you want to edit, click on the
`Advanced Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and edit the
[Email Alias]{.title-ref}.

## Invoice digitization

According to your settings, the document is either processed
automatically, or you need to click on
`Send for digitization`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to do it
manually.

Once the data is extracted from the PDF, you can correct it if necessary
by clicking on the respective tags (available in
`Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} mode) and selecting the proper
information instead.

## Data recognition with AI

It is essential to review and correct (if needed) the information
uploaded during digitization. Then, you have to post the document by
clicking on `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In this
manner, the AI learns, and the system identifies the correct data for
future digitizations.

## Pricing

The **invoice digitization** is an In-App Purchase (IAP) service that
requires prepaid credits to work. Digitizing one document consumes one
credit.

To buy credits, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Digitization`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click on `Buy credits`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or go to `Settings --> Odoo IAP`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click on `View My Services`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Enterprise Odoo users with a valid subscription get free credits to test
IAP features before deciding to purchase more credits for the database.
This includes demo/training databases, educational databases, and
one-app-free databases.

# Accounting and Invoicing

**Odoo Invoicing** is a standalone invoicing app to create invoices,
send them to your customers, and manage payments.

**Odoo Accounting** is a full featured accounting app. Accountant
productivity is at the core of its development with features such as
AI-powered invoice recognition, synchronization with your bank accounts,
smart matching suggestions, etc.

## Double-entry bookkeeping

Odoo automatically creates all the underlying journal entries for all
accounting transactions (e.g., customer invoices, vendor bills,
point-of-sales orders, expenses, inventory valuations, etc.).

Odoo uses the double-entry bookkeeping system, whereby every entry needs
a corresponding and opposite counterpart in a different account, with
one account debited and the other credited. It ensures that all
transactions are recorded accurately and consistently and that the
accounts always balance.

::: seealso
`Accounting Cheat Sheet <accounting/get_started/cheat_sheet>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Accrual and cash basis

Both accrual and cash basis accounting are supported in Odoo. This
allows reporting income and expense either when the transaction occurs
(accrual basis) or when the payment is made or received (cash basis).

::: seealso
`Cash basis <accounting/taxes/cash_basis>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## Multi-company

Several companies can be managed within the same database. Each company
has its `chart of
accounts <accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, which is also useful to generate consolidation reports.
Users can access several companies but can only work on a single
company\'s accounting at a time.

## Multi-currency environment

A
`multi-currency <accounting/get_started/multi_currency>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} environment with an automated exchange rate to ease
international transactions is available in Odoo. Every transaction is
recorded in the company\'s default currency; for transactions occurring
in another currency, Odoo stores both the value in the company\'s
currency and the transactions\' currency value. Odoo generates currency
gains and losses after reconciling the journal items.

::: seealso
`Manage a bank in a foreign currency <accounting/bank/foreign_currency>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## International standards

Odoo Accounting supports more than 70 countries. It provides the central
standards and mechanisms common to all nations, and thanks to
country-specific modules, local requirements are fulfilled. Fiscal
positions exist to address regional specificities like the chart of
accounts, taxes, or any other requirements.

::: seealso
`Fiscal localization packages <fiscal_localizations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Accounts receivable and payable

By default, there is a single account for the account receivable entries
and one for the account payable entries. As transactions are linked to
your **contacts**, you can run a report per customer, vendor, or
supplier.

The **Partner Ledger** report displays the balance of your customers and
suppliers. It is available by going to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Partner Ledger`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

## Reporting

The following financial
`reports <accounting/reporting>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} are
available and updated in real-time:

`Create and customize reports <accounting/reporting/customize>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} with Odoo\'s report engine.
::::

### Tax report

Odoo computes all accounting transactions for the specific tax period
and uses these totals to calculate the tax obligation.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Once the tax report has been generated for a period, Odoo locks it and
prevents the creation of new journal entries involving VAT. Any
correction to customer invoices or vendor bills has to be recorded in
the next period.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Depending on the country\'s localization, an XML version of the tax
report can be generated to be uploaded to the VAT platform of the
relevant taxation authority.
::::

## Bank synchronization

The bank synchronization system directly connects with your bank
institution to automatically import all transactions into your database.
It gives an overview of your cash flow without logging into an online
banking system or waiting for paper bank statements.

::: seealso
`Bank synchronization <accounting/bank/bank_synchronization>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Inventory valuation

Both periodic (manual) and perpetual (automated) inventory valuations
are supported in Odoo. The available methods are standard price, average
price, `LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
`FIFO (First-In, First-Out).`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}

::: seealso
`../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/product_management/inventory_valuation/inventory_valuation_config`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Retained earnings

Retained earnings are the portion of income retained by a business. Odoo
calculates current year earnings in real-time, so no year-end journal or
rollover is required. The profit and loss balance is automatically
reported on the balance sheet report.

::: seealso
`Accounting Cheat Sheet <accounting/get_started/cheat_sheet>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

## Fiduciaries

The `Accounting Firms`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} mode can be
activated by going to `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings --> Accounting Firms mode`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. When enabled:

- The document\'s sequence becomes editable on all documents;
- The `Total (tax incl.)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
  appears to speed up and control the encoding by automating line
  creation with the right account and tax;
- `Invoice Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and

# Expenses

Odoo **Expenses** streamlines the management of expenses. After an
employee submits their expenses in Odoo, the expenses are reviewed by
management and accounting teams. Once approved, payments can then be
processed and disbursed back to the employee for reimbursement(s).

[Odoo Expenses: product page](https://www.odoo.com/app/expenses)
:::

## Set expense categories

The first step to track expenses is to configure the different types of
expenses for the company (managed as *expense categories* in Odoo). Each
category can be as specific or generalized as needed. Go to
`Expenses app --> Configuration --> Expense Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to view the current expensable categories in a
default list view.

![Set expense costs on products.](expenses/categories.png){.align-center}

To create a new expense category, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. A product form will appear, with the description field
labeled `Product Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Expense categories are managed like products in Odoo. The expense
category form follows the standard product form in Odoo, and the
information entered is similar. Expense products will be referred to as
expense categories throughout this document since the main menu refers
to these as `Expense Categories`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

Only two fields are required, the `Product Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and the `Unit of Measure`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Enter the `Product Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the field, and select the
`Unit of Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down
menu (most products will be set to `Units`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}).

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The *Sales* app is where specification on the units of measure are
created and edited (e.g. units, miles, nights, etc.). Go to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and ensure [Units of Measure]{.title-ref} is
enabled in the [Product Catalog]{.title-ref} section. Click on the
`Units of Measure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} internal link to
`view, create, and edit the units of measure
<../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/product_management/configure/uom>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
::::

![Set expense costs on products.](expenses/new-expense-product.png){.align-center}

The `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the product form
is populated with a value of [0.00]{.title-ref} by default. When a
specific expense should always be reimbursed for a particular price,
enter that amount in the `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. Otherwise, leave the `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
set to [0.00]{.title-ref}, and employees will report the actual cost
when submitting an expense report.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is always visible on
the expense category form, but the `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field is *only* visible if the
`Sales Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected under the
`Re-Invoice Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.
Otherwise, the `Sales Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
hidden.
::::

::: example
Here are some examples for when to set a specific
`Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on a product vs. leaving the
`Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at \`0.00\`:

- **Meals**: Set the `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
  [0.00]{.title-ref}. When an employee logs an expense for a meal, they
  enter the actual amount of the bill and will be reimbursed for that
  amount. An expense for a meal costing \$95.23 would equal a
  reimbursement for \$95.23.
- **Mileage**: Set the `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
  [0.30]{.title-ref}. When an employee logs an expense for \"mileage\",
  they enter the number of miles driven in the
  `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and are
  reimbursed 0.30 per mile they entered. An expense for 100 miles would
  equal a reimbursement for \$30.00.
- **Monthly Parking**: Set the `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  to [75.00]{.title-ref}. When an employee logs an expense for \"monthly
  parking\", the reimbursement would be for \$75.00.
- **Expenses**: Set the `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
  [0.00]{.title-ref}. When an employee logs an expense that is not a
  meal, mileage, or monthly parking, they use the generic
  `Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} product. An expense for
  a laptop costing \$350.00 would be logged as an
  `Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} product, and the
  reimbursement would be for \$350.00.
:::

Select an `Expense Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if using
the Odoo *Accounting* app. It is recommended to check with the
accounting department to determine the correct account to reference in
this field as it will affect reports.

Set a tax on each product in the `Vendor Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Customer Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
fields, if applicable. It is considered good practice to use a tax that
is configured with `Tax Included
in Price <taxes/included-in-price>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Taxes
will be automatically configured if this is set.

## Record expenses {#expenses/new}

### Manually create a new expense

To record a new expense, begin in the main `Expenses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} app dashboard, which presents the default
`My Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view. This view can
also be accessed from
`Expenses app --> My Expenses --> My Expenses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

First, click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and then fill out
the various fields on the form.

- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a short
  description for the expense in the `Description`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field. This should be short and informative, such as
  [lunch with client]{.title-ref} or [hotel for conference]{.title-ref}.

- `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the expense
  category from the drop-down menu that most closely corresponds to the
  expense. For example, an airplane ticket would be appropriate for an
  expense `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} named
  `Air Travel`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the total amount
  paid for the expense in one of two ways:

  1.  If the expense is for one single item/expense, and the category
      selected was for a single item, enter the cost in the
      `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field (the
      `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is hidden).

  2.  If the expense is for multiples of the same item/expense with a
      fixed price, the `Unit Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
      is displayed. Enter the quantity in the
      `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and the total
      cost is automatically updated with the correct total (the
      `Unit Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} x the
      `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} = the total). Be
      advised, the word \"total\" does not appear, the total cost simply
      appears below the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

      ::: example
      For example, in the case of mileage driven, the
      `Unit Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is populated as
      the cost *per mile*. Set the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"} to the *number of miles* driven, and the total is
      calculated.
      :::

- `Included Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If taxes were
  configured on the expense category, the tax percentage and amount
  appear automatically after entering either the
  `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or the
  `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  When a tax is configured on an expense category, the
  `Included Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} value will update
  in real time as the `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is updated.
  ::::

- `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the employee this expense is for.

- `Paid By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Click the radio button
  to indicate who paid for the expense and should be reimbursed. If the
  employee paid for the expense (and should be reimbursed) select
  `Employee (to reimburse)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If the
  company paid directly instead (e.g. if the company credit card was
  used to pay for the expense) select `Company`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. Depending on the expense category selected, this
  field may not appear.

- `Bill Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If there is any
  reference text that should be included for the expense, enter it in
  this field.

- `Expense Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the calendar
  module, enter the date the expense was incurred. Use the
  `< (left)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `> (right)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} arrows to navigate to
  the correct month, then click on the specific day to enter the
  selection.

- `Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the expense
  account that this expense should be logged on from the drop-down menu.

- `Customer to Reinvoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the
  expense is something that should be paid for by a customer, select the
  `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and customer that
  will be invoiced for this expense from the drop-down menu. All sales
  orders in the drop-down menu list both the `SO (Sales
  Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} as well as the company the
  sales order is written for, but after the expense is saved, the
  customer name disappears and only the
  `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is visible on the
  expense.

  ::: example
  A customer wishes to have an on-site meeting for a custom garden
  (design and installation) and agrees to pay for the expenses
  associated with it (such as travel, hotel, meals, etc.). All expenses
  tied to that meeting would indicate the sales order for the custom
  garden (which also references the customer) as the
  `Customer to Reinvoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  :::

- `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  account(s) the expense should be written against from the drop-down
  menu for either `Projects`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Departments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or both. Multiple
  accounts can be listed for each category if needed. Adjust the
  percentage for each analytic account by typing in the percentage value
  next to the account.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If multiple companies
  are set up, select the company this expense should be filed for from
  the drop-down menu. The current company will automatically populate
  this field.

- `Notes...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If any notes are needed
  in order to clarify the expense, enter them in the notes field.

![A filled in expense form for a client lunch.](expenses/expense-filled-in.png){.align-center}

#### Attach a receipt

After the expense is created, the next step is to attach a receipt.
Click the `Attach
Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and a file explorer
appears. Navigate to the receipt to be attached, and click
`Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The new receipt is recorded
in the chatter, and the number of receipts will appear next to the
`📎 (paperclip)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon beneath the
expense form. More than one receipt can be attached to an individual
expense, as needed. The number of receipts attached to the expense will
be noted on the paperclip icon.

![Attach a receipt and it appears in the chatter.](expenses/receipt-icon.png){.align-center}

### Create new expenses from a scanned receipt

Rather than manually inputting all of the information for an expense,
expenses can be created by scanning a PDF receipt.

First, in the main `Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app
dashboard view (this view can also be accessed from
`Expenses app --> My Expenses --> My Expenses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}), click `Scan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and a file explorer pops up. Navigate to the receipt to be uploaded,
click on it to select it, and then click `Open`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Create an expense by scanning a receipt. Click Scan at the top of the Expenses dashboard
view.](expenses/scan.png){.align-center}

The receipt is scanned, and a new entry is created with today\'s date as
the `Expense
Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and any other fields it can
populate based on the scanned data, such as the total. Click on the new
entry to open the individual expense form, and make any changes needed.
The scanned receipt appears in the chatter.

### Automatically create new expenses from an email

Instead of individually creating each expense in the *Expenses* app,
expenses can be automatically created by sending an email to an email
alias.

To do so, first, an email alias needs to be configured. Go to
`Expenses app -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Ensure `Incoming Emails`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is enabled.

![Create the domain alias by clicking the link.](expenses/email-alias.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the domain alias needs to be set up,
`Setup your domain alias`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} will appear
beneath the incoming emails check box instead of the email address
field. Refer to this documentation for setup instructions and more
information:
`/applications/websites/website/configuration/domain_names`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. Once the domain alias is configured, the email address
field will be visible beneath the incoming emails section.
::::

Next, enter the email address to be used in the email field, and then
click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Now that the email
address has been entered, emails can be sent to that alias to create new
expenses without having to be in the Odoo database.

To submit an expense via email, create a new email and enter the
product\'s *internal reference* code (if available) and the amount of
the expense in the email subject. Next, attach the receipt to the email.
Odoo creates the expense by taking the information in the email subject
and combining it with the receipt.

To check an expense categories internal reference, go to
`Expenses app -->
Configuration --> Expense Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. If an internal reference is listed on the expense
category, it is listed in the `Internal Reference`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column.

![Internal reference numbers are listed in the main Expense Categories view.](expenses/ref.png){.align-center}

To add an internal reference on an expense category, click on the
category to open the form. Enter the internal reference in the field.
Beneath the `Internal Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, this sentence appears:
`Use this reference as a subject prefix when submitting by email.`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}

![Internal reference numbers are listed in the main Expense Products view.](expenses/mileage-internal-reference.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

For security purposes, only authenticated employee emails are accepted
by Odoo when creating an expense from an email. To confirm an
authenticated employee email address, go to the employee card in the
`Employees`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, and refer to
the `Work Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

![Create the domain alias by clicking the link.](expenses/authenticated-email-address.png){.align-center}
::::

::: example
If submitting an expense via email for a \$25.00 meal during a work
trip, the email subject would be [FOOD \$25.00]{.title-ref}.

Explanation:

- The `Internal Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
  expense category [Meals]{.title-ref} is [FOOD]{.title-ref}
- The `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the expense is
  [\$25.00]{.title-ref}
:::

## Create an expense report {#expenses/report}

When expenses are ready to submit (such as at the end of a business
trip, or once a month), an *expense report* needs to be created. Go to
the main `Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app
dashboard, which displays a default `My Expenses`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} view, or go to `Expenses app --> My
Expenses --> My Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Expenses are color coded by status. Any expense with a status of
`To Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (expenses that still need
to be added to an expense report) the text appears in blue. All other
statuses (`To Submit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Submitted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) the text appears in
black.

First, select each individual expense for the report by clicking the
check box next to each entry, or quickly select all the expenses in the
list by clicking the check box next to `Expense
Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Another way to quickly add all expenses that are not on an expense
report is to click `Create Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
without selecting any expenses, and Odoo will select all expenses with a
status of `To Submit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that are not
already on a report.

![Select the expenses to submit, then create the report.](expenses/create-report.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Any expense can be selected from the `My Expenses`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} list, regardless of status. The
`Create Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is visible as
long as there is a minimum of 1 expense with a status of
`To Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} selected. When the
`Create Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is clicked,
only expenses with a status of `To Submit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} that are *not* currently on another expense report will
appear in the newly created expense report.
::::

Once the expenses have been selected, click the
`Create Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. The new
report appears with all the expenses listed in the
`Expense`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. If there is a receipt
attached to an individual expense, a `📎 (paperclip)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon appears next to the `Customer
to Reinvoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns.

When the report is created, the date range for the expenses appears in
the `Expense Report
Summary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field by default. It is
recommended to edit this field with a short summary for each report to
help keep expenses organized. Enter a short description for the expense
report (such as [Client Trip NYC]{.title-ref}, or [Repairs for Company
Car]{.title-ref}) in the `Expense Report Summary`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. Next, select a `Manager`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu to assign a manager to review
the report. If needed, the `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
can be changed. Use the drop-down menu to select a different
`Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Enter a short description and select a manager for the report.](expenses/expense-report-summary.png){.align-center}

If some expenses are not on the report that should be, they can still be
added. Click `Add
a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the bottom of the
`Expense`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. A pop up appears with
all the available expenses that can be added to the report (with a
status of `To Submit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}). Click the
check box next to each expense to add, then click
`Select`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The items now appear on the
report that was just created. If a new expense needs to be added that
does *not* appear on the list, click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to create a new expense and add it to the report.

![Add more expenses to the report before submitting.](expenses/add-an-expense-line.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Expense reports can be created in one of three places:

1.  Go to the main `Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
    app dashboard (also accessed by going to
    `Expenses app --> My Expenses --> My Expenses`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"})
2.  Go to
    `Expenses app --> My Expenses --> My Reports`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}
3.  Go to `Expenses app --> Expense Reports`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}

In any of these views, click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
create a new expense report.
::::

### Submit an expense report {#expenses/submit}

When an expense report is completed, the next step is to submit the
report to a manager for approval. Reports must be individually
submitted, and cannot be submitted in batches. Open the specific report
from the list of expense reports (if the report is not already open). To
view all expense reports, go to
`Expenses app --> My Expenses --> My Reports`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

If the list is large, grouping the results by status may be helpful
since only reports that have a `To Submit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} status need to be submitted, reports with an
`Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Submitted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status do not.

The `To Submit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} expenses are easily
identifiable not just from the `To Submit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} status, but the text appears in blue, while the other
expenses text appears in black.

![Submit the report to the manager.](expenses/expense-status.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The status of each report is shown in the `Status`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column on the right. If the `Status`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} column is not visible, click the
`Additional Options (two dots)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon
at the end of the row, and enable `Status`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

Click on a report to open it, then click
`Submit To Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. After submitting
a report, the next step is to wait for the manager to approve it.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `expenses/approve`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`expenses/post`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
`expenses/reimburse`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} sections are **only**
for users with the *necessary rights*.
::::

## Approve expenses {#expenses/approve}

In Odoo, not just anyone can approve expense reports--- only users with
the necessary rights (or permissions) can. This means that a user must
have at least *Team Approver* rights for the *Expenses* app. Employees
with the necessary rights can review expense reports, approve or reject
them, and provide feedback thanks to the integrated communication tool.

To see who has rights to approve, go to the main
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app and click on
`Manage Users`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the *Settings* app is not available, then certain rights are not set
on the account. Check the `Access Rights`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of a user\'s card in the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app. the
`Administration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section (bottom
right of the `Access Rights`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab) is
set to one of three options:

- `None (blank)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The user cannot
  access the *Settings* app at all.
- `Access Rights`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The user can only
  view the `User's & Companies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  section of the *Settings* app.
- `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The user has access to
  the entire *Settings* app with no restrictions.

Please refer to
`this document </applications/general/users>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to learn more about managing users and their access rights.
::::

Click on an individual to view their card, which displays the
`Access Rights`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab in the default
view. Scroll down to the `Human Resources`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section. Under `Expenses`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, there are four options:

- `None (blank)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A blank field means
  the user has no rights to view or approve expense reports, and can
  only view their own.
- `Team Approver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The user can only
  view and approve expense reports for their own specific team.
- `All Approver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The user can view
  and approve any expense report.
- `Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The user can view
  and approve any expense report, as well as access the reporting and
  configuration menus in the *Expenses* app.

Users who are able to approve expense reports (typically managers) can
easily view all expense reports they have access rights to. Go to
`Expenses app --> Expense Reports`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and a list appears with all expense reports that
have a status of either `To Submit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Submitted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Posted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or `Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Expense reports with a status of
`Refused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are hidden in the default
view.

![Reports to validate are found on the Reports to Approve page.](expenses/expense-reports-list.png){.align-center}

When viewing expense reports, there is a panel of filters that can be
enabled or disabled on the left side. The three categories that filters
can be applied on are `Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To view only expense
reports with a particular status, enable the specific status filter to
display the expense reports with only that status. Disable the specific
status filter to hide the reports with that status. To view expense
reports for a particular employee and/or company, enable the specific
employee name filter and/or company filter in the
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sections.

Reports can be approved in two ways (individually or several at once)
and refused only one way. To approve multiple expense reports at once,
remain in the list view. First, select the reports to approve by
clicking the check box next to each report, or click the box next to
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to select all the reports
in the list.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Only reports with a status of `Submitted`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} can be approved. It is recommended to only display the
submitted reports by adjusting the status filter on the left side by
only having the `Submitted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter
enabled.

If a report is selected that is unable to be approved, the
`Approve Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button **will not
appear**, indicating there is a problem with the selected report(s).
::::

Next, click the `Approve Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button.

![Approve multiple reports by clicking the checkboxes next to each report.](expenses/approve-report.png){.align-center}

To approve an individual report, click on a report to go to a detailed
view of that report. In this view, several options are presented:
`Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Report in Next Payslip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Reset to draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click
`Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to approve the report.

If `Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is clicked, a pop-up
window appears. Enter a brief explanation for the refusal in the
`Reason to Refuse Expense`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and
then click `Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Send messages in the chatter.](expenses/refuse-expense.png){.align-center}

Team managers can easily view all the expense reports for their team
members. While in the `Expense Reports`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} view, click the drop-down arrow in the right-side of
the search box, and click on `My Team`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section. This presents all the reports for the manager\'s team.

![Select the My Team filter.](expenses/my-team-filter.png){.align-center}

If more information is needed, such as a missing receipt, communication
is easy from the chatter. In an individual report, simply click
`Send message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to open the message
text box. Type in a message, tagging the proper person (if needed), and
post it to the chatter by clicking `Send`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The message is posted in the chatter, and the person
tagged will be notified via email of the message, as well as any
followers.

The only people that can be tagged in a message are *followers*. To see
who is a follower, click on the `👤 (person)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon to display the followers of the expense.

## Post expenses in accounting {#expenses/post}

Once an expense report is approved, the next step is to post the report
to the accounting journal. To view all expense reports, go to
`Expenses app --> Expense Reports`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. To view only the expense reports that have been
approved and need to be posted, adjust the filters on the left side so
that only the `Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} status is
enabled.

![View reports to post by clicking on expense reports, then reports to post.](expenses/post-reports.png){.align-center}

Just like approvals, expense reports can be posted in two ways
(individually or several at once). To post multiple expense reports at
once, remain in the list view. First, select the reports to post by
clicking the check box next to each report, or click the box next to
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to select all the reports
in the list. Next, click `Post Entries`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Post multiple reports at a time from the Expense Reports view, with the Approved filter.](expenses/post-entries.png){.align-center}

To post an individual report, click on a report to go to the detailed
view of that report. In this view, several options are presented:
`Post Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Report In Next
Payslip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Refuse`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Reset to Draft`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Click `Post Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to post the report.

If `Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is clicked, a pop-up
window appears. Enter a brief explanation for the refusal in the
`Reason to Refuse Expense`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and
then click `Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Refused reports
can be viewed by going to
`Expenses app --> Expense Reports`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then adjusting the filters on the left so that
only `Refused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected. This will
only show the refused expense reports.

To post expense reports to an accounting journal, the user must have
following access rights:

- Accounting: Accountant or Adviser
- Expenses: Manager
::::

## Reimburse employees {#expenses/reimburse}

After an expense report is posted to an accounting journal, the next
step is to reimburse the employee. To view all the expense reports to
pay, go to `Expenses app --> Expense
Reports --> Reports To Pay`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

![View reports to pay by clicking on expense reports, then reports to pay.](expenses/reports-to-pay.png){.align-center}

Just like approvals and posting, expense reports can be paid in two ways
(individually or several at once). To pay multiple expense reports at
once, remain in the list view. First, select the reports to pay by
clicking the check box next to each report, or click the box next to
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to select all the reports
in the list. Next, click `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Post multiple reports by selecting them, clicking the gear, and then post the entries.](expenses/register-payment.png){.align-center}

To pay an individual report, click on a report to go to a detailed view
of that report. Click `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to pay the employee.

A `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up appears,
and the `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Payment
Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Payment Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be modified, if
needed. When the selections are correct, click
`Create Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to send the payment
to the employee.

To pay an individual report, click on a report in the list view to go to
a detailed view of that report. Click
`Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to pay the
employee. A `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
appears, but when paying an individual expense report instead of several
at once, more options appear in the pop-up. In addition to the
`Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Payment Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields, a
`Recipient Bank Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Memo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appear. Select the
employee\'s bank account from the drop-down menu to directly deposit the
payment to their account. When all other selections are correct, click
`Create Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to send the payment
to the employee.

![Different options appear when registering an individual expense report versus multiple
expense reports at once.](expenses/two-payment-posting-options.png){.align-center}

## Re-invoice expenses to customers

If expenses are tracked on customer projects, expenses can be
automatically charged back to the customer. This is done by creating an
expense, referencing the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} the expense should be added to, and then creating the
expense report. Next, managers approve the expense report, and the
accounting department posts the journal entries. Finally, once the
expense report is posted to a journal, the expense(s) appears on the
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} that was referenced.
The sales order can then be invoiced, thus invoicing the customer for
the expense.

### Setup

First, specify the invoicing policy for each expense category. Go to
`Expenses app
--> Configuration --> Expense Categories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click on the expense category to open the expense
category form. Under the `Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section, click the radio button next to the desired selection for
`Re-Invoicing Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Options are
`None`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `At cost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `Sales price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

`Re-Invoicing Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:

- `None`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Expense category will not
  be re-invoiced.
- `At cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Expense category will
  invoice expenses at their real cost.
- `At sales price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Expense category
  will invoice the price set on the sale order.

### Create an expense

First, when `creating a new expense <expenses/new>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, the correct information needs to be entered in order to
re-invoice a customer. Select the *sales order* the expense will appear
on in the `Customer to Reinvoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section, from the drop-down menu. Next, select the
`Analytic Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the expense will
be posted to. After the expense(s) are created, the expense report needs
to be `created <expenses/report>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`submitted <expenses/submit>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} as usual.

![Ensure the customer to be invoiced is called out on the expense.](expenses/reinvoice-expense.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Selecting a `Customer to Reinvoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
when creating an expense is critical, since this is what causes the
expenses to be automatically invoiced after an expense report is
approved.

The `Customer to Reinvoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field can
be modified *until an expense report is* **approved**, then the field is
no longer able to be modified.
::::

### Validate and post expenses

Only employees with permissions (typically managers or supervisors) can
`approve expenses
<expenses/approve>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Before approving an
expense report, ensure the `Analytic
Distribution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set on every expense
line of a report. If an `Analytic Distribution`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is missing, assign the correct account(s) from the
drop-down menu, and then click `Approve`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The accounting department is typically responsible for
`posting journal entries
<expenses/post>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Once an expense report
is approved, it can then be posted. The `SO (Sales
Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is **only** updated *after the
journal entries are posted*. One the journal entries are posted, the
expenses now appear on the referenced
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

### Invoice expenses

Once the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} has been
updated, it is time to invoice the customer. After the expense report
has been approved and the journal entries have been posted, click the
`Sales Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button to open
the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. The expenses to
be re-invoiced are now on the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

![After the expense report is posted to the journal entry, the sales order can be called up
by clicking on the sales order number.](expenses/sales-order.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

More than one `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} can be
referenced on an expense report. If more than one
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is referenced, the
`Sales Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button will list
the number of `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}\'s. If
multiple `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}\'s are
listed, the `Sales Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button opens a list view of all the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}\'s on the expense report. Click on a
`SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to open the individual
`SO (Sales
Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
::::

The expenses are listed in the `SO (Sales Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![See the expenses listed on the sales order after clicking into it.](expenses/so-details.png){.align-center}

Next, click `Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
select if the invoice is for a `Regular
invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
`Down payment (percentage)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or a
`Down payment (fixed amount)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} by
clicking the radio button next to it. Then, click
`Create Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The customer has
now been invoiced for the expenses.

### Modules installation

`Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the following
modules to get all the features of the Argentinean localization:

### Configure your company

Once the localization modules are installed, the first step is to set up
the company\'s data. In addition to the basic information, a key field
to fill in is the `AFIP Responsibility
Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which represents the fiscal
obligation and structure of the company.

![Select AFIP Responsibility Type.](argentina/select-responsibility-type.png){.align-center}

### Chart of account

In Accounting, there are three different
`Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} packages to
choose from. They are based on a company\'s AFIP responsibility type,
and consider the difference between companies that do not require as
many accounts as the companies that have more complex fiscal
requirements:

- Monotributista (227 accounts);
- IVA Exento (290 accounts);
- Responsable Inscripto (298 Accounts).

![Select Fiscal Localization Package.](argentina/select-fiscal-package.png){.align-center}

### Configure master data

#### Electronic Invoice Credentials

##### Environment

The AFIP infrastructure is replicated in two separate environments,
**testing** and **production**.

Testing is provided so that the companies can test their databases until
they are ready to move into the **Production** environment. As these two
environments are completely isolated from each other, the digital
certificates of one instance are not valid in the other one.

To select a database environment, go to
`Accounting --> Settings --> Argentinean
Localization`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and choose either
`Prueba (Testing)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Produccion (Production)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Select AFIP database environment: Testing or Production.](argentina/select-environment.png){.align-center}

##### AFIP certificates

The electronic invoice and other AFIP services work with
`Web Services (WS)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} provided by the
AFIP.

In order to enable communication with the AFIP, the first step is to
request a `Digital
Certificate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if you do not have one
already.

1.  `Generate Certificate Sign Request (Odoo)`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}. When this option is selected, a file with
    extension [.csr]{.title-ref} (certificate signing request) is
    generated to be used in the AFIP portal to request the certificate.

    ![Request a certificate.](argentina/request-certificate.png)

2.  `Generate Certificate (AFIP)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
    Access the AFIP portal and follow the instructions described in
    [this
    document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17OKX2lNWd1bjUt3NxfqcCKBkBh-Xlpo-/view)
    to get a certificate.

3.  `Upload Certificate and Private Key (Odoo)`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}. Once the certificate is generated, upload it to
    Odoo using the `Pencil`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon next
    to the field `Certificado`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
    select the corresponding file.

    ![Upload Certificate and Private Key.](argentina/upload-certificate-private-key.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

In case you need to configure the Homologation Certificate, please refer
to the AFIP official documentation: [Homologation
Certificate](http://www.afip.gob.ar/ws/documentacion/certificados.asp).
Furthermore, Odoo allows the user to test electronic invoicing locally
without a Homologation Certificate. The following message will be in the
chatter when testing locally:

![Invoice validated locally because it is in a testing environment without testing
certificate/keys.](argentina/local-testing.png){.align-center}
::::

#### Partner

##### Identification type and VAT

As part of the Argentinean localization, document types defined by the
AFIP are now available in the **Partner form**. Information is essential
for most transactions. There are six
`Identification Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} available by
default, as well as 32 inactive types.

![A list of AR Localization document types in Odoo, as defined by AFIP.](argentina/identification-types.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The complete list of `Identification Types`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} defined by the AFIP is included in Odoo, but only the
common ones are active.
::::

##### AFIP responsibility type

In Argentina, the document type and corresponding transactions
associated with customers and vendors is defined by the AFIP
Responsibility type. This field should be defined in the **Partner
form**.

![Select AFIP Responsibility Type.](argentina/select-afip-responsibility-type.png){.align-center}

#### Taxes

As part of the localization module, the taxes are created automatically
with their related financial account and configuration, e.g., 73 taxes
for `Responsable Inscripto`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![A list of AR Localization taxes with financial amount and configuration in Odoo.](argentina/automatic-tax-configuration.png){.align-center}

##### Taxes types

Argentina has several tax types, the most common ones are:

- `VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this is the regular VAT and
  can have various percentages;
- `Perception`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: advance payment of a
  tax that is applied on invoices;
- `Retention`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: advance payment of a
  tax that is applied on payments.

##### Special taxes

Some Argentinean taxes are not commonly used for all companies, and
those less common options are labeled as inactive in Odoo by default.
Before creating a new tax, be sure to check if that tax is not already
included as inactive.

![A list showing less common Argentinean tax options, which are labeled as inactive in Odoo
by default.](argentina/special-inactive-taxes.png){.align-center}

#### Document types

In some Latin American countries, like Argentina, some accounting
transactions such as invoices and vendor bills are classified by
document types defined by the governmental fiscal authorities. In
Argentina, the [AFIP](https://www.afip.gob.ar/) is the governmental
fiscal authority that defines such transactions.

The document type is an essential piece of information that needs to be
clearly displayed in printed reports, invoices, and journal entries that
list account moves.

Each document type can have a unique sequence per journal where it is
assigned. As part of the localization, the document type includes the
country in which the document is applicable (this data is created
automatically when the localization module is installed).

The information required for the `Document Types`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is included by default so the user does not need to
fill anything on this view:

![A list of document types in Odoo.](argentina/default-document-type-info.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

There are several `Document Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
types that are inactive by default, but can be activated as needed.
::::

##### Letters

For Argentina, the `Document Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
include a letter that helps indicate the type of transaction or
operation. For example, when an invoice is related to a(n):

- `B2B transaction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a document type
  `A`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be used;
- `B2C transaction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a document type
  `B`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be used;
- `Exportation Transaction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
  document type `E`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be used.

The documents included in the localization already have the proper
letter associated with each `Document Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, so there is no further configuration necessary.

![document types grouped by letters.](argentina/document-types-grouped-by-letters.png){.align-center}

##### Use on invoices

The `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on each
transaction will be determined by:

- The journal entry related to the invoice (if the journal uses
  documents);
- The onditions applied based on the type of issuer and receiver (e.g.,
  the type of fiscal regime of the buyer and the type of fiscal regime
  of the vendor).

### Journals

In the Argentinean localization, the journal can have a different
approach depending on its usage and internal type. To configure
journals, go to `Accounting --> Configuration -->
Journals`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

For sales and purchase journals, it\'s possible to activate the option
`Use Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which enables a list
of `Document Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that can be
related to the invoices and vendor bills. For more detail on invoices,
please refer to the section `2.3 document types
<document-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

If the sales or purchase journals do not have the
`Use Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option activated,
they will not be able to generate fiscal invoices, meaning, their use
case will be mostly limited to monitoring account moves related to
internal control processes.

#### AFIP information (also known as AFIP Point of Sale)

The `AFIP POS System`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is a field only
visible for the **Sales** journals and defines the type of AFIP POS that
will be used to manage the transactions for which the journal is
created.

The AFIP POS defines the following:

1.  the sequences of document types related to the web service;
2.  the structure and data of the electronic invoice file.

![A AFIP POS System field which is available on Sales journals in Odoo.](argentina/sales-journal.png){.align-center}

##### Web services

**Web services** help generate invoices for different purposes. Below
are a few options to choose from:

- `wsfev1: Electronic Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: is
  the most common service, which is used to generate invoices for
  document types A, B, C, M with no detail per item;
- `wsbfev1: Electronic Fiscal Bond`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  is for those who invoice capital goods and wish to access the benefit
  of the Electronic Tax Bonds granted by the Ministry of Economy. For
  more details go to: [Fiscal
  Bond](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/acceder-un-bono-por-fabricar-bienes-de-capital);
- `wsfexv1: Electronic Exportation Invoice`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: is used to generate invoices for international
  customers and transactions that involve exportation processes, the
  document type related is type \"E\".

![Web Services.](argentina/web-services.png){.align-center}

Here are some useful fields to know when working with web services:

- `AFIP POS Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: is the number
  configured in the AFIP to identify the operations related to this AFIP
  POS;
- `AFIP POS Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: is the field
  related to the commercial address registered for the POS, which is
  usually the same address as the company. For example, if a company has
  multiple stores (fiscal locations) then the AFIP will require the
  company to have one AFIP POS per location. This location will be
  printed in the invoice report;
- `Unified Book`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: when the AFIP POS
  System is Preimpresa, then the document types (applicable to the
  journal) with the same letter will share the same sequence. For
  example:
  - Invoice: FA-A 0001-00000002;
  - Credit Note: NC-A 0001-00000003;
  - Debit Note: ND-A 0001-00000004.

#### Sequences

For the first invoice, Odoo synchronizes with the AFIP automatically and
displays the last sequence used.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When creating `Purchase Journals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
it\'s possible to define whether they are related to document types or
not. In the case where the option to use documents is selected, there
would be no need to manually associate the document type sequences,
since the document number is provided by the vendor.
::::

## Usage and testing

### Invoice

The information below applies to invoice creation once the partners and
journals are created and properly configured.

#### Document type assignation

When the partner is selected, the `Document Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field will be filled in automatically based on the AFIP
document type:

- **Invoice for a customer IVA Responsable Inscripto, prefix A** is the
  type of document that shows all the taxes in detail along with the
  customer\'s information.

  ![Invoice for a customer IVA Responsable Inscripto, prefix A.](argentina/prefix-a-invoice-for-customer.png)

- **Invoice for an end customer, prefix B** is the type of document that
  does not detail the taxes, since the taxes are included in the total
  amount.

  ![Invoice for an end customer, prefix B.](argentina/prefix-b-invoice-for-end-customer.png)

- **Exportation Invoice, prefix E** is the type of document used when
  exporting goods that shows the incoterm.

  ![Exportation Invoice, prefix E](argentina/prefix-e-exporation-invoice.png)

Even though some invoices use the same journal, the prefix and sequence
are given by the `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

The most common `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} will
be defined automatically for the different combinations of AFIP
responsibility type but it can be updated manually by the user before
confirming the invoice.

#### Electronic invoice elements

When using electronic invoices, if all the information is correct then
the invoice is posted in the standard way unless there is an error that
needs to be addressed. When error messages pop up, they indicate both
the issue that needs attention along with a proposed solution. If an
error persists, the invoice remains in draft until the issue is
resolved.

Once the invoice is posted, the information related to the AFIP
validation and status is displayed in the AFIP tab, including:

- `AFIP Autorisation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: CAE number;
- `Expiration Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: deadline to
  deliver the invoice to the customers (normally 10 days after the CAE
  is generated);
- `Result:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} indicates if the invoice
  has been `Aceptado en AFIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and/or
  `Aceptado con Observaciones`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![AFIP Status.](argentina/afip-status.png){.align-center}

#### Invoice taxes

Based on the `AFIP Responsibility type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, the VAT tax can apply differently on the PDF report:

- `A. Tax excluded`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: in this case the
  taxed amount needs to be clearly identified in the report. This
  condition applies when the customer has the following AFIP
  Responsibility type of **Responsable Inscripto**;

  ![Tax excluded.](argentina/tax-amount-excluded.png)

- `B. Tax amount included`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this
  means that the taxed amount is included as part of the product price,
  subtotal, and totals. This condition applies when the customer has the
  following AFIP Responsibility types:

  - IVA Sujeto Exento;
  - Consumidor Final;
  - Responsable Monotributo;
  - IVA liberado.

  ![Tax amount included.](argentina/tax-amount-included.png){.align-center}

#### Special use cases

##### Invoices for services

For electronic invoices that include `Services`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, the AFIP requires to report the service starting and
ending date, this information can be filled in the tab
`Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Invoices for Services.](argentina/invoices-for-services.png){.align-center}

If the dates are not selected manually before the invoice is validated,
the values will be filled automatically with the first and last day of
the invoice\'s month.

![Service Dates.](argentina/service-dates.png){.align-center}

##### Exportation invoices

Invoices related to `Exportation Transactions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} require that a journal uses the AFIP POS System **Expo
Voucher - Web Service** so that the proper document type(s) can be
associated.

![Exporation journal.](argentina/exporation-journal.png){.align-center}

When the customer selected in the invoice is configured with an AFIP
responsibility type `Cliente / Proveedor del Exterior`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} - `Ley N° 19.640`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
Odoo automatically assigns the:

- Journal related to the exportation Web Service;
- Exportation document type;
- Fiscal position: Compras/Ventas al exterior;
- Concepto AFIP: Products / Definitive export of goods;
- Exempt Taxes.

![Export invoice fields autofilled in Odoo.](argentina/export-invoice.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The Exportation Documents require Incoterms to be enabled and
configured, which can be found in
`Other Info --> Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
::::

![Export invoice - Incoterm.](argentina/export-invoice-incoterm.png){.align-center}

##### Fiscal bond

The `Electronic Fiscal Bond`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is used
for those who invoice capital goods and wish to access the benefit of
the Electronic Tax Bonds granted by the Ministry of Economy.

For these transactions, it is important to consider the following
requirements:

- Currency (according to the parameter table) and invoice quotation;
- Taxes;
- Zone;
- Detail each item;
  - Code according to the Common Nomenclator of Mercosur (NCM);
  - Complete description;
  - Unit Net Price;
  - Quantity;
  - Unit of measurement;
  - Bonus;
  - VAT rate.

##### Electronic credit invoice MiPyme (FCE)

For SME invoices, there are several document types that are classified
as **MiPyME**, which are also known as **Electronic Credit Invoice** (or
**FCE** in Spanish). This classification develops a mechanism that
improves the financing conditions for small and medium-sized businesses,
and allows them to increase their productivity, through the early
collection of credits and receivables issued to their clients and/or
vendors.

For these transactions it\'s important to consider the following
requirements:

- specific document types (201, 202, 206, etc);
- the emitter should be eligible by the AFIP to MiPyME transactions;
- the amount should be bigger than 100,000 ARS;
- A bank account type CBU must be related to the emisor, otherwise the
  invoice cannot be validated, having an error message such as the
  following.

![Bank account relation error.](argentina/bank-account-relation-error.png){.align-center}

To set up the `Transmission Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, go
to settings and select either `SDC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
or `ADC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Transmission Mode.](argentina/transmission-mode.png){.align-center}

To change the `Transmission Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
a specific invoice, go to the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab and change it before confirming.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Changing the `Transmission Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} will
not change the mode selected in `Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

![Transmission Mode on Invoice.](argentina/transmission-mode-on-invoice.png){.align-center}

When creating a `Credit/Debit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} note
related to a FCE document:

- use the `Credit and Debit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  buttons, so all the information from the invoice is transferred to the
  new `Credit and Debit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
- the document letter should be the same as than the originator document
  (either A or B);
- the same currency as the source document must be used. When using a
  secondary currency there is an exchange difference if the currency
  rate is different between the emission day and the payment date. It is
  possible to create a credit/debit note to decrease/increase the amount
  to pay in ARS.

![Credit & debit notes buttons.](argentina/credit-debit-notes-button.png){.align-center}

When creating a `Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} we can
have two scenarios:

1.  the FCE is rejected so the `Credit Note`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} should have the field `FCE, is
    Cancellation?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as *True*; or;
2.  the `Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, is created to
    annulate the FCE document, in this case the field
    `FCE, is Cancellation?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be
    *empty* (false).

![FCE: Es Cancelación?](argentina/fce-es-cancelation.png){.align-center}

#### Invoice printed report

The `PDF Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} related to
electronic invoices that have been validated by the AFIP includes a
barcode at the bottom of the format which represents the CAE number. The
expiration date is also displayed as it is a legal requirement.

![Invoice printed report.](argentina/invoice-printed-report.png){.align-center}

#### Troubleshooting and auditing

For auditing and troubleshooting purposes, it is possible to obtain
detailed information of an invoice number that has been previously sent
to the AFIP. To retrieve this information, activate the
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, then go
to the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} menu and
click on the button `Consult Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button in AFIP.

![Consult invoice in AFIP.](argentina/consult-invoice-in-afip.png){.align-center}

![Details of invoice consulted in AFIP.](argentina/consult-invoice-in-afip-details.png){.align-center}

It is also possible to retrieve the last number used in AFIP for a
specific document type and POS Number as a reference for any possible
issues on the sequence synchronization between Odoo and AFIP.

![Consult the last invoice number.](argentina/consult-last-invoice-number.png){.align-center}

### Vendor bills

Based on the purchase journal selected for the vendor bill, the
`Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is now a required
field. This value is auto-populated based on the AFIP Responsibility
type of Issuer and Customer, but the value can be changed if necessary.

![Changing journal and document type.](argentina/changing-journal-document-type.png){.align-center}

The `Document Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field needs to
be registered manually and the format will be validated automatically.
However, in case the format is invalid, a user error will be displayed
indicating the correct format that is expected.

![Vendor bill document number.](argentina/vendor-bill-document-number.png){.align-center}

The vendor bill number is structured in the same way as the customer
invoices, excepted that the document sequence is entered by the user
using the following format: *Document Prefix - Letter -Document Number*.

#### Validate vendor bill number in AFIP

As most companies have internal controls to verify that the vendor bill
is related to an AFIP valid document, an automatic validation can be set
in `Accounting --> Settings -->
Argentinean Localization --> Validate document in the AFIP`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, considering the following levels:

- `Not available:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the verification
  is not done (this is the default value);
- `Available:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the verification is
  done. In case the number is not valid, it only displays a warning but
  still allows the vendor bill to be posted;
- `Required:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the verification is
  done, and it does not allow the user to post the vendor bill if the
  document number is not valid.

![Verify Vendor Bills validity in AFIP.](argentina/verify-vendor-bills.png){.align-center}

##### Validate vendor bills in Odoo

With the vendor validation settings enabled, a new button shows up on
the vendor bills inside of Odoo, labeled
`Verify on AFIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which is located
next to the `AFIP
Authorization code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

![Verify on AFIP.](argentina/verify-on-afip.png){.align-center}

In case the vendor bill cannot be validated in AFIP, a value of
`Rejected`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} will be displayed on the
dashboard and the details of the invalidation will be added to the
chatter.

![AFIP authorization Rejected.](argentina/afip-auth-rejected.png){.align-center}

#### Special use cases

##### Untaxed concepts

There are some transactions that include items that are not a part of
the VAT base amount, such as fuel and gasoline invoices.

The vendor bill will be registered using one item for each product that
is part of the VAT base amount, and an additional item to register the
amount of the exempt concept.

![VAT exempt.](argentina/vat-exempt.png){.align-center}

##### Perception taxes

The vendor bill will be registered using one item for each product that
is part of the VAT base amount, and the perception tax can be added in
any of the product lines. As a result, there will be one tax group for
the VAT and another for the perception. The perception default value is
always `0.10`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To edit the VAT perception and set the correct amount, you should use
the `Pencil`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon that is the next to
the `Perception`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} amount. After the
VAT perception amount has been set, the invoice can then be validated.

![Enter the perception amount.](argentina/enter-perception-amount.png){.align-center}

### Check management

To install the *Third Party and Deferred/Electronic Checks Management*
module, go to `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and search
for the module by its technical name [l10n_latam_check]{.title-ref} and
click the `Activate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![l10n_latam_check module.](argentina/l10n-latam-check-module.png){.align-center}

This module enables the required configuration for journals and payments
to:

- Create, manage, and control your different types of checks
- Optimize the management of *own checks* and *third party checks*
- Have an easy and effective way to manage expiration dates from your
  own and third party checks

Once all the configurations are made for the Argentinian electronic
invoice flow, it is also needed to complete certain configurations for
the own checks and the third party checks flows.

#### Own checks

Configure the bank journal used to create your own checks by going to
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
selecting the bank journal, and opening the `Outgoing
Payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

- `Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should be available as a
  `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If not, click
  `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and type
  [Checks]{.title-ref} under `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to add them
- Enable the `Use electronic and deferred checks`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} setting.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This last configuration **disables** the printing ability but enables
to:

- Enter check numbers manually
- Adds a field to allocate the payment date of the check
::::

![Bank journal configurations.](argentina/bank-journal-conf.png){.align-center}

##### Management of own checks

Own checks can be created directly from the vendor bill. For this
process, click on the `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

On the payment registration modal, select the bank journal from which
the payment is to be made and set the
`Check Cash-In Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Payment pop-up window with own check options enabled.](argentina/payment-popup-vendorbill.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To manage current checks, the `Check Cash-In Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field must be left blank or filled in with the current
date. To manage deferred checks, the
`Check Cash-In Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be set in
the future.
::::

To manage your existing own checks, navigate to
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Own
Checks`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. This window shows
critical information such as the dates when checks need to be paid, the
total quantity of checks, and the total amount paid in checks.

![Own checks menu location.](argentina/checks-menu-vendorbill.png){.align-center}

It is important to note that the list is pre-filtered by checks that are
still *not reconciled* with a bank statement - that were not yet debited
from the bank - which can be verified with the
`Is Matched with a Bank Statement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. If you want to see all of your own checks, delete the
`No Bank Matching`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter by clicking
on the `X`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} symbol.

![Own checks menu organization and filtering.](argentina/check-menu-list-vendorbill.png){.align-center}

##### Cancel an own check

To cancel an own check created in Odoo, navigate to
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Own
Checks`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select the check to
be canceled, then click on the `Void Check`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. This will break the reconciliation with the
vendor bills and the bank statements and leave the check in a
**canceled** state.

![Empty Check button to cancel Own Checks](argentina/empty-check-button.png){.align-center}

#### Third party checks

In order to register payments using third party checks, two specific
journals need to be configured. To do so, navigate to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and create two new journals:

- [Third Party Checks]{.title-ref}
- [Rejected Third Party Checks]{.title-ref}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

You can manually create more journals if you have multiple points of
sale and need journals for those.
::::

To create the *Third Party Checks* journal, click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and configure the
following:

- Type [Third Party Checks]{.title-ref} as the
  `Journal Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- Select `Cash`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
  `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- In the `Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, set
  `Cash Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to [1.1.1.02.010
  Cheques de Terceros]{.title-ref}, input a
  `Short Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of your choice, and
  select a `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

![Automatically created cash account.](argentina/auto-cash-account.png){.align-center}

The available payment methods are listed in the *payments* tabs:

- For new incoming third party checks, go to
  `Incoming Payments tab --> Add a line`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"} and select
  `New Third Party Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This
  method is used to create *new* third party checks.
- For incoming and outgoing existing third party checks, go to
  `Incoming Payments tab
  --> Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select
  `Existing Third Party Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
  Repeat the same step for the `Outgoing Payments`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} tab. This method is used to receive and/or pay vendor
  bills using already *existing* checks, as well as for internal
  transfers.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can delete pre-existing payment methods appearing by default when
configuring the third party checks journals.
::::

![Payment methods automatically created.](argentina/auto-payment-methods.png){.align-center}

The *Rejected Third Party Checks* journal also needs to be created
and/or configured. This journal is used to manage rejected third party
checks and can be utilized to send checks rejected at the moment of
collection or when coming from vendors when rejected.

To create the *Rejected Third Party Checks* journal, click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and configure the
following:

- Type [Rejected Third Party Checks]{.title-ref} as the
  `Journal Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- Select `Cash`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
  `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- In the `Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, set
  `Cash Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to [1.1.1.01.002
  Rejected Third Party Checks]{.title-ref}, input a
  `Short Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of your choice, and
  select a `Currency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

Use the same payment methods as the *Third Party Checks* journal.

##### New third party checks

To register a *new* third party check for a customer invoice, click the
`Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. In the
pop-up window, you must select `Third Party Checks`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} as journal for the payment registration.

Select `New Third Party Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and fill in the
`Check Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Payment Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Check Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Optionally, you can
manually add the `Check Issuer Vat`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
but this is automatically filled by the customer\'s VAT number related
to the invoice.

![Payment pop-up window with New Third Party Check options enabled.](argentina/third-party-payment-popup.png){.align-center}

##### Existing third party checks

To pay a vendor bill with an *existing* check, click the
`Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. In the
pop-up window, you must select `Third Party Checks`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} as journal for the payment registration.

Select `Existing Third Party Checks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
as `Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select a
check from the `Check`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. The
field shows all **available existing checks** to be used as payment for
vendor bills.

![Payment pop-up window with Existing Third Party Check options enabled.](argentina/existing-third-party-popup.png){.align-center}

When an **existing third party check** is used, you can review the
operations related to it. For example, you can see if a third party
check made to pay a customer invoice was later used as an existing third
party check to pay a vendor bill.

To do so, either go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Third Party Checks`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} or
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Own Checks`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} depending on the case, and click on a check. In
the `Check Current Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
click on `=> Check Operations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
bring up the check\'s history and movements.

![Check Operations menu.](argentina/check-operations-menulist.png){.align-center}

The menu also displays critical information related to these operations,
such as:

- The `Payment Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, allowing to
  classify whether it is a payment *sent* to a vendor or a payment
  *received* from a customer
- The `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in which the check is
  currently registered
- The **partner** associated with the operation (either customer or
  vendor).

## Reports

As part of the localization installation, financial reporting for
Argentina was added to the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard. Access these reports by navigating to
`Accounting
--> Reporting --> Argentinean Reports`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}

![Argentinean reports.](argentina/argentinian-reports.png){.align-center}

### VAT reports

#### Sales VAT book

In this report, all the sales are recorded, which are taken as the basis
for the accounting records to determine the VAT (Tax Debit).

The `Sales VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} book report can be
exported in a [.zip]{.title-ref} file `VAT BOOK (ZIP)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the top left, which contains
[.txt]{.title-ref} files to upload in the AFIP portal.

![Sales VAT book.](argentina/sales-vat-book.png){.align-center}

#### Purchases VAT book

The `Purchases VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} book report can
be exported in a [.zip]{.title-ref} file `VAT BOOK
(ZIP)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the top left, which
contains [.txt]{.title-ref} files to upload in the AFIP portal.

![Purchases VAT book.](argentina/purchases-vat-book.png){.align-center}

#### VAT summary

Pivot table designed to check the monthly VAT totals. This report is for
internal usage, it is not sent to the AFIP.

![VAT Summary.](argentina/vat-summary.png){.align-center}

### IIBB - Reports

#### IIBB - Sales by jurisdiction

Pivot table where you can validate the gross income in each
jurisdiction. Affidavit for the corresponding taxes to pay, therefore it
is not sent to the AFIP.

![IIBB Sales by jurisdiction.](argentina/iibb-sales-jurisdiction.png){.align-center}

#### IIBB - Purchases by jurisdiction

Pivot table where you can validate the gross purchases in each
jurisdiction. Affidavit for the corresponding taxes to pay, therefore it
is not sent to the AFIP.

# Australia

## Employment Hero Australian Payroll {#australia/employment-hero}

The Employment Hero module synchronizes payslip accounting entries
(e.g., expenses, social charges, liabilities, taxes) from Employment
Hero to Odoo automatically. Payroll administration is still done in
Employment Hero. We only record the journal entries in Odoo.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

KeyPay was rebranded as **Employment Hero** in March 2023.
::::

### Configuration

1.  `Activate <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
    `Employment Hero Australian Payroll`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} module (technical name:
    [l10n_au_keypay]{.title-ref}).

2.  Configure the **Employment Hero API** by going to
    `Accounting --> Configuration -->
    Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. More fields
    become visible after clicking on `Enable Employment Hero
    Integration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

    ![Enabling Employment Hero Integration in Odoo Accounting displays new fields in the
    settings](australia/employment-hero-integration.png)

    - You can find the API Key in the `My Account`{.interpreted-text
      role="guilabel"} section of the Employment Hero platform.

      ![\"Account Details\" section on the Employment Hero dashboard](australia/employment-hero-myaccount.png)

    - The **Payroll URL** is pre-filled with
      [https://keypay.yourpayroll.com.au]{.title-ref}. *Please do not
      change it.*

    - You can find the **Business ID** in the Employment Hero URL.
      (i.e., [189241]{.title-ref})

      ![The Employment Hero \"Business ID\" number is in the URL](australia/employment-hero-business-id.png)

    - You can choose any Odoo journal to post the payslip entries.

### How does the API work?

The API syncs the journal entries from Employment Hero to Odoo and
leaves them in draft mode. The reference includes the Employment Hero
payslip entry ID in brackets for the user to easily retrieve the same
record in Employment Hero and Odoo.

![Example of a Employment Hero Journal Entry in Odoo Accounting (Australia)](australia/employment-hero-journal-entry.png)

By default, the synchronization happens once per week. You can fetch the
records manually by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and, in the `Enable
Employment Hero Integration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option,
click on `Fetch Payruns Manually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Employment Hero payslip entries also work based on double-entry
bookkeeping.

The accounts used by Employment Hero are defined in the section
`Payroll settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Chart of Accounts menu in Employment Hero](australia/employment-hero-chart-of-accounts.png)

For the API to work, you need to create the same accounts as the default
accounts of your Employment Hero business (**same name and same code**)
in Odoo. You also need to choose the correct account types in Odoo to
generate accurate financial reports.

by going to `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Accounting: Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

The Belgian chart of accounts includes pre-configured accounts as
described in the `PCMN(Plan
Comptable Minimum Normalisé)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. To add a
new account, click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. A new line
appears. Fill it in, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and then `Setup`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to configure it
further.

## Taxes {#belgium/taxes}

Default Belgian taxes are created automatically when the
`Belgium - Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
`Belgium - Accounting Reports`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
modules are installed. Each tax impacts the Belgian
`Tax Report`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, available by going to
`Accounting --> Reporting -->
Statements Reports: Tax Report`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

In Belgium, the standard VAT rate is **21%**, but there are lower rates
for some categories of goods and services. An intermediate rate of
**12%** is applied on social housing and food served in restaurants,
while a reduced rate of **6%** applies to most basic goods, such as
food, water supply, books, and medicine. A **0%** rate applies to some
exceptional goods and services, such as some daily and weekly
publications, as well as recycled goods.

### Non-deductible taxes {#belgium/non-deductible}

In Belgium, some taxes are not fully deductible, such as taxes on the
maintenance of cars. This means a part of these taxes is considered as
an expense.

In Odoo, you can configure non-deductible taxes by creating tax rules
for these taxes and linking them to the corresponding accounts. This
way, the system automatically calculates the taxes and allocates them to
the appropriate accounts.

To configure a new non-deductible tax, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Accounting: Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:

1.  `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select
    `Base`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
    `Based On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column;
2.  `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then select
    `on tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
    `Based on`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column and enter the
    **non-deductible** percentage in the `%`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} column;
3.  On the `of tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line, select the
    `Tax Grid(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} related to your
    tax;
4.  `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with the
    **deductible** percentage in the `%`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} column;
5.  Set `of tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
    `Based On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
6.  Select `411000 VAT recoverable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    as account, and select the related tax grid.

Once you have created a non-deductible tax, you can apply it to your
transactions by selecting the appropriate tax during the encoding of
bills and credit notes. The system automatically calculates the tax
amount and allocates it to the corresponding accounts based on the tax
rules configured.

::: example
With the Belgian localization, the **21% car** tax is created by default
(50% non-deductible).

Here is the list of Belgian-specific reports available:

- Balance sheet;
- Profit & loss;
- Tax report;
- Partner VAT Listing;
- EC Sales List;

### Disallowed expenses report {#belgium/disallowed-expenses}

**Disallowed expenses** are expenses that can be deducted from your
accounting result but not from your fiscal result.

The **disallowed expenses report** is available by going to
`Accounting --> Reporting
--> Management: Disallowed Expenses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. It allows financial results in real-time, and
periodic changes. This report is generated based on the **disallowed
expenses categories** that you can reach by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Management: Disallowed Expenses
Categories`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Some categories
already exist by default but do not have any rates. Click on
`Set Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to update a specific
category.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- You can add multiple rates for various dates. In that case, the rate
used to calculate the expense depends on the date at which it is
calculated, and the rate set for that date. - If you have the **Fleet**
app installed, tick the `Car Category`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} box when applicable. This makes the vehicle mandatory
while booking a vendor bill.
::::

To link a disallowed expenses category with a specific account, go to
`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Acounting: Chart of Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Find the account you want, and click on
`Setup`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Add the
`Disallowed Expense category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Disallowed
Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. From now, when an
expense is created with this account, the disallowed expense is
calculated based on the rate mentioned in the
`Disallowed Expense category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Let\'s take an example reflecting **restaurant** and **car expenses**.

#### Restaurant expenses {#belgium/restaurant-expenses}

In Belgium, 31% of **restaurant** expenses are non-deductible. Create a
new **disallowed expenses category** and set both
`Related Account(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Current Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Disallowed expenses categories](belgium/restaurant-expenses.png)

#### Car expenses: vehicle split {#belgium/vehicle-split}

In Belgium, the deductible percentage varies from car to car and,
therefore, should be indicated for each vehicle. To do so, open
`Fleet`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and select a vehicle. In
the `Tax
info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, go to the
`Disallowed Expenses Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section
and click on `Add a
line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Add a
`Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a
`%`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The amounts go in the same
account for all car expenses.

When you create a bill for car expenses, you can link each expense to a
specific car by filling the `Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column, so the right percentage is applied.

![Disallowed expenses categories](belgium/car-bill.png)

The `vehicle split`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option available
in the disallowed expenses report allows you to see the rate and
disallowed amount for each car.

![Disallowed expenses categories](belgium/vehicle-split.png)

## Fee form 281.50 and form 325 {#belgium/forms}

### Fee form 281.50 {#belgium/281.50}

Annually, a **281.50 fee form** must be reported to the fiscal
authorities. To do so, the tag [281.50]{.title-ref} must be added on the
**contact form** of the entities concerned by the **281.50** fee. To add
the tag, open `Contacts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select
the person or company you want to create a **281.50 fee form** for, and
add the [281.50]{.title-ref} tag in the `Tags`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

![add the tag 281.50 on a contact form](belgium/281-50.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Make sure the **street, zip code, country**, and **VAT number** are also
informed on the **Contact form**.
::::

Then, depending on the nature of the expense, add the corresponding
[281.50]{.title-ref} tag on the impact accounts. To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Accounting: Chart of
Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click on
`Setup`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add the corresponding
[281.50]{.title-ref} tag on the impacted accounts, i.e.,
`281.50 - Commissions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, depending on
the nature of the expense.

### Form 325 {#belgium/325}

You can create a **325 form** by going to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Belgium:
Create 325 form`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. A new page
pops up: select the right options and click `Generate 325
form`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To open an already generated
**325 form**, go to `Accounting --> Reporting -->
Belgium: Open 325 forms`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

![Add the tag 281-50 on a contact form](belgium/325-form.png)

## CODA and SODA statements {#belgium/coda-soda}

### CODA {#belgium/coda}

**CODA** is an electronic XML format used to import Belgian bank
statements. You can download CODA files from your bank and import them
directly into Odoo by clicking `Import Statement`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from your `Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
journal on your dashboard.

**SODA** is an electronic XML format used to import accounting entries
related to salaries. SODA files can be imported into the journal you use
to record salaries by going to your Accounting **dashboard** and
clicking `Upload`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the related
journal card form.

Once your **SODA** files are imported, the entries are created
automatically in your \'salary\' journal.

![Import SODA files](belgium/soda-import.png)

## Electronic invoicing {#belgium/einvoicing}

Odoo supports the **E-FFF** and **Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 (UBL)**
electronic invoicing formats. To enable them, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals --> Customer Invoices
--> Advanced Settings --> Electronic Invoicing`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and tick `E-FFF (BE)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Peppol BIS Billing 3.0`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
`../accounting/customer_invoices/electronic_invoicing`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}

## Cash discount {#belgium/cash-discount}

In Belgium, if an early payment discount is offered on an invoice, the
tax is calculated based on the discounted total amount, whether the
customer benefits from the discount or not.

To apply the right tax amount and report it correctly in your VAT
return, set the tax reduction as
`Always (upon invoice)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
`../accounting/customer_invoices/cash_discounts`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}

## Fiscal certification: POS restaurant {#belgium/pos-restaurant-certification}

In Belgium, the owner of a cooking business such as a restaurant or food
truck is required by law to use a government-certified **Cash Register
System** for their receipts. This applies if their yearly earnings
(excluding VAT, drinks, and take-away food) exceed 25,000 euros.

This government-certified system entails the use of a
`certified POS system
<belgium/certified-pos>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, along with a
device called a `Fiscal Data Module <belgium/fdm>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (or **black box**) and a
`VAT Signing Card <belgium/vat>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

### Certified POS system {#belgium/certified-pos}

The Odoo POS system is certified for the major versions of databases
hosted on **Odoo Online**, **Odoo.sh**, and **On-Premise**. Please refer
to the following table to ensure that your POS system is certified.

              Odoo Online   Odoo.sh     On-Premise
  ----------- ------------- ----------- ------------
  Odoo 18.0   Certified     Certified   Certified

::: seealso
`/administration/supported_versions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

A [certified POS
system](https://www.systemedecaisseenregistreuse.be/systemes-certifies)
must adhere to rigorous government regulations, which means it operates
differently from a non-certified POS.

- On a certified POS, you cannot:
  - Set up and use the **global discounts** feature (the
    [pos_discount]{.title-ref} module is blacklisted and cannot be
    activated).
  - Set up and use the **loyalty programs** feature (the
    [pos_loyalty]{.title-ref} module is blacklisted and cannot be
    activated).
  - Reprint receipts (the [pos_reprint]{.title-ref} module is
    blacklisted and cannot be activated).
  - Modify prices in order lines.
  - Modify or delete order lines in POS orders.
  - Sell products without a valid VAT number.
  - Use a POS that is not connected to an IoT box.
- The
  `cash rounding <../../sales/point_of_sale/pricing/cash_rounding>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} feature must be activated and set to a
  `Rounding Precision`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of
  [0,05]{.title-ref} and a `Rounding Method`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} set as `Half-Up`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- Taxes must be set as included in the price. To set it up, go to
  `Point of Sale -->
  Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
  and from the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section,
  open the `Default Sales Tax`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form
  by clicking the arrow next to the default sales tax field. There,
  click `Advanced Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and enable
  `Included in Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- At the start of a POS session, users must click
  `Work in`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to clock in. Doing so
  allows the registration of POS orders. If users are not clocked in,
  they cannot make POS orders. Likewise, they must click
  `Work Out`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to clock out at the end
  of the session.

:::: warning

If you configure a POS to work with a
`FDM (Fiscal Data Module)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, you cannot
use it again without it.
::::

### Fiscal Data Module (FDM) {#belgium/fdm}

An FDM, or **black box**, is a government-certified device that works
together with the Point of Sale application and saves your POS orders
information. Concretely, a **hash** (`unique code`{.interpreted-text
role="dfn"}) is generated for each POS order and added to its receipt.
This allows the government to verify that all revenue is declared.

:::: warning

:::

Only the FDM from **Boîtenoire.be** with the [FDM certificate number
BMC04](https://www.systemedecaisseenregistreuse.be/fr/systemes-certifies#FDM%20certifiés)
is supported by Odoo. [Contact the manufacturer (GCV
BMC)](https://www.boîtenoire.be/contact) to order one.
::::

#### Configuration

Before setting up your database to work with an FDM, ensure you have the
following hardware:

- a **Boîtenoire.be** (certificate number BMC04) FDM;
- an RS-232 serial null modem cable per FDM;
- an RS-232 serial-to-USB adapter per FDM;
- an `IoT Box <belgium/iotbox>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} (one IoT
  box per FDM); and
- a receipt printer.

##### Black box module {#belgium/blackbox}

As a pre-requisite, `activate <general/install>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} the [Belgian Registered Cash Register]{.title-ref} module
(technical name: [pos_blackbox_be]{.title-ref}).

Once the module is activated, add your VAT number to your company
information. To set it up, go to
`Settings --> Companies --> Update Info`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and fill in the `VAT`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. Then, enter a national registration number for
every staff member who operates the POS system. To do so, go to the
`Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} app and open an employee
form. There, go to `HR
settings tab --> Attendance/Point of Sale`{.interpreted-text

you must contact us through our [support contact
form](https://www.odoo.com/help) and provide the following information:

- your VAT number;
- your company\'s name, address, and legal structure; and
- the Mac address of your IoT Box.

Once your IoT box is certified,
`connect <../../general/iot/config/connect>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} it to your database. To verify that the IoT Box recognizes
the FDM, go to the IoT homepage and scroll down the
`IOT Device`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, which should
display the FDM.

![Hardware status page on a registered IoT Box](belgium/iot-devices.png)

Then, add the IoT to your POS. To do so, go to
`Point of Sale --> Configuration -->
Point of Sale`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select your POS,
scroll down to the `Connected Device`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section, and enable `IoT Box`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Lastly, add the FMD in the `Fiscal Data Module`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

# Brazil

## Introduction

With the Brazilian localization you can automatically compute sales
taxes for goods using AvaTax (Avalara) through API calls, also configure
taxes for services.

For the goods tax computation part, you need to configure the
`contacts <brazil/contacts>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`company <brazil/company>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`products <brazil/products>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
`create an account in
Avatax <brazil/avatax-account>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} from the
Odoo general settings.

For the services taxes, you can create and configure them from Odoo
directly without computing them with AvaTax.

The localization also includes taxes and a chart of accounts template
that can be modified if needed.

## Configuration

### Modules installation

`Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the following
modules to get all the features of the Brazilian localization:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Name                                              Technical name                      Description

If you are a simplified regime, you need to configure the ICMS rate
under
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Taxes --> Avatax Brazil`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

### Configure AvaTax integration {#brazil/avatax-account}

Avalara AvaTax is a tax calculation provider that can be integrated in
Odoo to automatically compute taxes by taking into account the company,
contact (customer), product, and transaction information to retrieve the
correct tax to be used.

Odoo is a certified partner of Avalara Brazil, which means that Avalara
experts reviewed workflows covered within the scope of the integration.

Using this integration requires `In-App-Purchases (IAPs)
</applications/essentials/in_app_purchase>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to compute taxes. Every time you compute taxes, an API call
is made, using credits from your
`IAP (In-app-purchase)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} credits balance.

#### Credential configuration

To activate AvaTax in Odoo, you need to create an account. To do so, go
to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and, in the `AvaTax
Brazil`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, add the email
address you want to use to log in to the AvaTax portal, and click on
`Create account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This email is used
as the administrator email address in AvaTax.

After you create the account from Odoo, you need to go to the Avalara
Portal to set up your password:

### Configure master data

#### Chart of accounts

The
`chart of accounts </applications/finance/accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is installed by default as part of the data set included in
the localization module. The accounts are mapped automatically in their
corresponding taxes, and the default account payable and account
receivable fields.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The chart of accounts for Brazil is based on the SPED CoA, which gives a
baseline of the accounts needed in Brazil.

You can add or delete accounts according to the company\'s needs.
::::

#### Taxes

Taxes are automatically created when installing the Brazilian
localization. Taxes are already configured, and some of them are used by
Avalara when computing taxes on the sales order or invoice.

Taxes can be edited, or more taxes can be added. For example, some taxes
used for services need to be manually added and configured, as the rate
may differ depending on the city where you are offering the service.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Taxes attached to services are not computed by AvaTax. Only goods taxes
are computed.
::::

When configuring a tax used for a service that is included in the final
price (when the tax is not added or subtracted on top of the product
price), set the `Tax Computation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Percentage of Price Tax Included`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and, on the `Advanced Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
check the `Included in Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option.

For more information on configuring taxes to fit your needs better,
please go to the `taxes
functional documentation </applications/finance/accounting/taxes>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

![Tax configuration.](brazil/tax-configuration.png)

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Do not delete taxes, as they are used for the AvaTax tax computation. If
deleted, Odoo creates them again when used in an
`SO (Sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or invoice and
computing taxes with AvaTax, but the account used to register the tax
needs to be re-configured in the tax\'s `Definition`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, under the
`Distribution for invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Distribution for refunds`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sections.
::::

#### Products {#brazil/products}

To use the AvaTax integration on sale orders and invoices, first specify
the following information on the product:

- `CEST Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (Code for products
  subject to ICMS tax substitution)
- `Mercosul NCM Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (Mercosur
  Common Nomenclature Product Code)
- `Source of Origin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (Indicates the
  origin of the product, which can be foreign or domestic, among other
  possible options depending on the specific use case)
- `SPED Fiscal Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (Fiscal
  product type according to SPED list table)
- `Purpose of Use`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (Specify the
  intended purpose of use for this product)

![Product configuration.](brazil/product-configuration.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Odoo automatically creates three products to be used for transportation
costs associated with sales. These are named [Freight]{.title-ref},
[Insurance]{.title-ref}, and [Other Costs]{.title-ref}. They are already
configured, if more need to be created, duplicate and use the same
configuration (configuration needed: `Product Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} [Service]{.title-ref},
`Transportation Cost Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
[Insurance]{.title-ref}, [Freight]{.title-ref}, or [Other
Costs]{.title-ref})
::::

#### Contacts {#brazil/contacts}

Before using the integration, specify the following information on the
contact:

1.  General information about the contact:

    - Select the `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option for
      a contact with a tax ID (CNPJ), or check
      `Individual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for a contact with
      a CPF.
    - `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    - `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
      `Zip Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is a required field
      to compute taxes properly.
    - `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
      `CPF`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Use CPF for individuals
      and Tax ID (CNPJ) for companies
    - `IE`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: state tax identification
      number
    - `IM`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: municipa tax
      identification number
    - `SUFRAMA code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: SUFRAMA
      registration number
    - `Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    - `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

    ![Contact configuration.](brazil/contact-configuration.png)

    :::: note

    `SUFRAMA code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields are are
    hidden until the `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set
    to [Brazil]{.title-ref}.
    ::::

2.  Fiscal information about the contact under the
    `Sales & Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:

    - `Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: add the
      AvaTax fiscal position to automatically compute taxes on sale
      orders and invoices automatically.
    - `Tax Regime`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: federal tax
      regime
    - `ICMS Taxpayer Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: taxpayer
      type determines if the contact is within the ICMS regime, if it is
      exempt, or if it is a non-taxpayer.
    - `Main Activity Sector`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: list of
      main activity sectors of the contact

    ![Contact fiscal configuration.](brazil/contact-fiscal-configuration.png)

#### Fiscal positions {#brazil/fiscal-positions}

To compute taxes on sale orders and invoices, it is necessary to have a
`Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with the
`Detect Automatically`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
`Use AvaTax API`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options enabled.

The `Fiscal Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be
configured on the contact or selected when creating a sales order or an
invoice.

The `DTE Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is the email used for
sending electronic documents and must be set in the contact that will be
part of an electronic document.
::::

![Chilean electronic invoice data for partners.](chile/dte-email-electronic-invoice.png){.align-center}

## Document types

Accounting documents are categorized by
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}-defined document types.

Document types are created automatically upon installation of the
localization module, and can be managed by navigating to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Document Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![Chilean fiscal document types list.](chile/chilean-document-types.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Several document types are inactive by default but can be activated by
toggling the `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option.
::::

### Use on invoices

The document type on each transaction is determined by:

- The journal related to the invoice, identifying if the journal uses
  documents.
- The condition applied based on the type of issuer and recipient (e.g.,
  the buyer or vendor\'s fiscal regime).

## Journals

*Sales journals* in Odoo usually represent a business unit or location.

::: example
\- Ventas Santiago. - Ventas Valparaiso.
:::

For retail stores it is common to have one journal per
`POS (Point of Sale)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

::: example
\- Cashier 1. - Cashier 2.
:::

The *purchase* transactions can be managed with a single journal, but
sometimes companies use more than one journal in order to handle some
accounting transactions that are not related to vendor bills. This
configuration can easily be set by using the following model.

::: example
\- Tax payments to the government. - Employees payments.
:::

### Create a sales journal

To create a sales journal, navigate to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, and fill in the following required information:

- `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Sale`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu for
  customer invoice journals.
- `Point of sale type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the sales
  journal will be used for electronic documents, the option
  `Online`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be selected.
  Otherwise, if the journal is used for invoices imported from a
  previous system or if you are using the `SII (Servicio de Impuestos
  Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} portal *Facturación MiPyme*,
  you can use the option `Manual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Use Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: check this field
  if the journal will use document types. This field is only applicable
  to purchase and sales journals that can be related to the different
  sets of document types available in Chile. By default, all the sales
  journals created will use documents.

Next, from the `Jounal Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
define the `Default Income Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Dedicated Credit Note Squence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
in the `Accounting Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section. Configuring these fields is required for one of the debit notes
`use cases <chile/use-cases>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

## CAF {#chile/caf-documentation}

A *folio authorization code* (CAF) is required for each document type
that will be issued electronically. The
`CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is a
file the `SII (Servicio de
Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} provides to the
issuer with the folios/sequences authorized for the electronic invoice
documents.

Your company can request multiple folios and obtain several
`CAFs (Folio Authorization Codes)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} linked
to different folio ranges. These
`CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are
shared within all journals, so you only need one active
`CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} per
document type, and it will be applied to all journals.

Please refer to the [SII
documentation](https://palena.sii.cl/dte/mn_timbraje.html) to check the
details on how to acquire the
`CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} files.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
required by the `SII (Servicio de Impuestos
Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} are different from production
to test (certification mode). Make sure you have the correct
`CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} set
depending on your environment.
::::

### Upload CAF files

Once the `CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
files have been acquired from the `SII
(Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} portal,
they need to be uploaded in the database by navigating to
`Accounting --> Configuration: Chilean SII --> CAFs`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} begin the configuration. On the
`CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} form,
upload your `CAF
(Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} file by
clicking the `Upload your file`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button and then click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Once uploaded, the status changes to `In Use`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. At this moment, when a transaction is used for this
document type, the invoice number takes the first folio in the sequence.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The document types have to be active before uploading the
`CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} files.
In case some folios have been used in the previous system, the next
valid folio has to be set when the first transaction is created.
::::

## Chart of accounts

The chart of accounts is installed by default as part of the data set
included in the localization module. The accounts are mapped
automatically in:

## Taxes

As part of the localization module, taxes are created automatically with
their related financial account and configuration. These taxes can be
managed from `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Chile has several tax types, the most common ones are:

- **VAT**: the regular VAT can have several rates.
- **ILA**: the tax for alcoholic drinks.

## Usage and testing

### Electronic invoice workflow

In the Chilean localization, the electronic invoice workflow includes
customer invoice issuance and vendor bill reception. The following
diagram explains how information is shared to the `SII
(Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
customers, and vendors.

![Diagram with Electronic invoice transactions.](chile/electronic-invoice-workflow.png){.align-center}

### Customer invoice emission

After the partners and journals are created and configured, the invoices
are created in the standard way. For Chile, one of the differences is
the document type that is automatically selected based on the taxpayer.
The document type can be changed manually if needed on the invoice by
navigating to `Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![Customer invoice document type selection.](chile/customer-invoice-document-type.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

`Documents type 33`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} electronic
invoice must have at least one item with tax, otherwise the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
rejects the document validation.
::::

#### Validation and DTE status {#chile/electronic-invoice-validation}

Once all invoice information is filled, either manually or automatically
when generated from a sales order, validate the invoice. After the
invoice is posted:

- The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} file is created automatically and recorded in the
  chatter.

- The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} status is set as `Pending`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to be sent.

  ![DTE XML File displayed in chatter.](chile/xml-creation.png){.align-center}

The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} status is updated automatically by Odoo with a scheduled
action that runs every day at night, if the response from the
`SII (Servicio de
Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is needed
immediately, you can do it manually as well by following the
`DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} status workflow:

![Transition of DTE status flow.](chile/dte-status-flow.png){.align-center}

1.  The first step is to send the
    `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} to the `SII
    (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
    This can be sent manually by clicking the `Enviar
    Ahora`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. This generates a
    `SII Tack number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
    invoice, which is used to check the details sent by the
    `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} via email. Then, the `DTE status`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} is updated to `Ask for Status`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

2.  Once the `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} response is received, Odoo updates the
    `DTE status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To do it manually,
    click on the button `Verify on SII`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}. The result can either be
    `Accepted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    `Accepted With Objection`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `Rejected`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

    ![Identification transaction for invoice and Status update.](chile/dte-status-steps.png){.align-center}

    :::: important
    ::: title
    Important
    :::

    There are intermediate statuses in the
    `SII (Serviciqo de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} before acceptance or rejection. It\'s recommended to
    **NOT** continuously click `Verify in
    SII`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for smooth processing.

    ![Electronic invoice data statuses.](chile/chatter-internal-statuses.png){.align-center}
    ::::

3.  The final response from the
    `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} can take on one of these values:

    - `Accepted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: indicates the
      invoice information is correct, our document is now fiscally valid
      and it\'s automatically sent to the customer.

    - `Accepted with objections`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
      indicates the invoice information is correct, but a minor issue
      was identified, nevertheless the document is now fiscally valid
      and it\'s automatically sent to the customer.

    - `Rejected`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: indicates the
      invoice information is incorrect and must be corrected. Details
      are sent to emails you registered in the
      `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
      role="abbr"}. If it is properly configured in Odoo, the details
      are also retrieved in the chatter once the email server is
      processed.

      If the invoice is rejected please follow these steps:

      1.  Change the document to `Draft`{.interpreted-text
          role="guilabel"}.
      2.  Make the required corrections based on the message received
          from the `SII (Servicio
          de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in the
          chatter.
      3.  Post the invoice again.

      ![Message when an invoice is rejected.](chile/rejected-invoice.png){.align-center}

#### Crossed references

When the invoice is created, as a result of another fiscal document, the
information related to the originator document must be registered in the
`Cross-Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. This tab is
commonly used for credit or debit notes, however, in some cases it can
be used for customer invoices, as well. In the case of the credit and
debit notes, they are set automatically by Odoo.

![Crossed referenced document(s).](chile/cross-reference-tab-registration.png){.align-center}

#### Invoice PDF report {#chile/electronic-invoice-pdf-report}

Once the invoice is accepted and validated by the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
and the PDF is printed, it includes the fiscal elements that indicate
that the document is fiscally valid.

![Fiscal elements and barcode printed in accepted invoices.](chile/accepted-invoice-fiscal-information.png)

:::: important

If you are hosted in Odoo SH or On-Premise, you should manually install
the [pdf417gen](https://pypi.org/project/pdf417gen/) library. Use the
following command to install it:
`pip install pdf417gen`{.interpreted-text role="command"}.
::::

#### Commercial validation

Once the invoice has been sent to the customer:

1.  `DTE Partner Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} changes to
    `Sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
2.  The customer must send a reception confirmation email.
3.  Subsequently, if commercial terms and invoice data are correct, an
    acceptance confirmation is sent; otherwise, a claim is sent.
4.  The field `DTE Acceptance Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    is updated automatically.

![Message with the commercial acceptance from the customer.](chile/partner-dte-status.png){.align-center}

#### Processed for claimed invoices

Once the invoice has been accepted by the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
**it can not be cancelled in Odoo**. In case you get a claim for your
customer, the correct way to proceed is with a credit note to either
cancel the invoice or correct it. Please refer to the
`chile/credit-notes`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} section for more
details.

![Invoice Commercial status updated to claimed.](chile/accepted-invoice.png){.align-center}

#### Common errors

There are multiple reasons behind a rejection from the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
but these are some of the common errors you might have and how to solve
them:

- | **Error:** [RECHAZO- DTE Sin Comuna Origen]{.title-ref}
  | **Hint:** make sure the company address is properly filled including
    the state and city.

- | **Error:** [en Monto - IVA debe declararse]{.title-ref}
  | **Hint:** the invoice lines should include one VAT tax, make sure
    you add one on each invoice line.

- | **Error:** [Rut No Autorizado a Firmar]{.title-ref}
  | **Hint:** the `RUT (Rol Único Tributario)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} entered is not allowed to invoice electronically, make
    sure the company `RUT (Rol Único Tributario)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} is correct and is valid in the
    `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} to invoice electronically.

- | **Error:** [Fecha/Número Resolucion Invalido RECHAZO- CAF Vencido :
    (Firma_DTE\[AAAA-MM-DD\] - CAF\[AAAA-MM-DD\]) &gt; 6
    meses]{.title-ref}
  | **Hint:** try to add a new CAF related to this document as the one
    you\'re using is expired.

- | **Error:** [Element \'{http://www.sii.cl/SiiDte%7DRutReceptor\':
    This element is not expected. Expected is (
    {http://www.sii.cl/SiiDte%7DRutEnvia ).]{.title-ref}
  | **Hint:** Make sure the field `Document Type`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} and `VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are
    set in the customer and in the main company.

- | **Error:** [Usuario sin permiso de envio.]{.title-ref}
  | **Hint:** this error indicates that most likely, your company has
    not passed the [Certification
    process](https://www.sii.cl/factura_electronica/factura_mercado/proceso_certificacion.htm)
    in the `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} - Sistema de Facturación de Mercado. If this is the
    case, please contact your Account Manager or Customer Support as
    this certification is not part of the Odoo services, but we can give
    you some alternatives. If you already passed the certification
    process, this error appears when a user different from the owner of
    the certificate is trying to send
    `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} files to the
    `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"}.

- | **Error:** [CARATULA]{.title-ref}
  | **Hint:** there are just five reasons why this error could show up
    and all of them are related to the *Caratula* section of the XML:

  > - The company\'s `RUT (Rol Único Tributario)`{.interpreted-text
  >   role="abbr"} number is incorrect or missing.
  > - The certificate owner
  >   `RUT (Rol Único Tributario)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} number
  >   is incorrect or missing.
  > - The `SII's (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text
  >   role="abbr"} `RUT (Rol Único Tributario)`{.interpreted-text
  >   role="abbr"} number (this should be correct by default) is
  >   incorrect or missing.
  > - The resolution date is incorrect or missing.
  > - The resolution number is incorrect or missing.

### Credit notes {#chile/credit-notes}

When a cancellation or correction is needed over a validated invoice, a
credit note must be generated. It is important to consider that a
`CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} file is
required for the credit note, which is identified as
`Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`61`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
Please refer to the `CAF section
<chile/caf-documentation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for more
information on the process to load the `CAF (Folio
Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} on each document
type.

![Creation of CAF for Credit notes.](chile/credit-note-document-type.png){.align-center}

#### Use cases

##### Cancel referenced document

In case you need to cancel or invalidate an invoice, navigate to
`Accounting -->
Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
select the desired invoice. Then, use the button `Add Credit
Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select
`Full Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, in this case the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos
Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} reference code is
automatically set to `Anula Documento de referencia`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Credit note canceling the referenced document.](chile/credit-note-cancel-ref-doc.png){.align-center}

##### Correct referenced document

If a correction in the invoice information is required, for example the
street name on the original invoice is wrong, then use the button
`Add Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select
`Partial Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select the
option `Only Text Correction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In
this case the `SII Reference
Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is automatically set to
`Corrects Referenced Document Text`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Credit note correcting referenced document text.](chile/credit-note-correct-text.png){.align-center}

Odoo creates a credit note with the corrected text in an invoice and
`Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} [0.00]{.title-ref}.

![Credit note with the corrected value on the invoice lines.](chile/text-correction-label.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Make sure to define the `Default Credit Account`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the sales journal specifically for this use case.
::::

##### Corrects referenced document amount

When a correction on the amounts is required, use the button
`Add Credit note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and select
`Partial Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In this case the
`SII Reference Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is automatically
set to `Corrige el monto del Documento de Referencia`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Credit note for partial refund to correct amounts, using the SII reference code 3.](chile/credit-note-correct-amount.png){.align-center}

### Debit notes

In Chilean localization, debit notes, in addition to credit notes, can
be created using the `Add Debit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button, with two main use cases.

#### Use cases {#chile/use-cases}

##### Add debt on invoices

The primary use case for debit notes is to increase the value of an
existing invoice. To do so, select option
`3. Corrige el monto del Documento de Referencia`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for the `Reference Code SII`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.

![Debit note correcting referenced document amount.](chile/debit-note-correct-amount.png){.align-center}

In this case Odoo automatically includes the
`Source Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the `Cross
Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![Automatic reference to invoice in a debit note.](chile/auto-ref-debit-note.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can only add debit notes to an invoice already accepted by the SII.
::::

##### Cancel credit notes

In Chile, debits notes are used to cancel a valid credit note. To do
this, click the `Add
Debit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and select the
`1: Anula Documentos de referencia`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option for the `Reference Code SII`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field.

![Debit note to cancel the referenced document (credit note).](chile/debit-note-cancel-ref-doc.png){.align-center}

### Vendor bills

As part of the Chilean localization, you can configure your incoming
email server to match the one you have registered in the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} in
order to:

- Automatically receive the vendor bills
  `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} and create the vendor bill based on this information.
- Automatically send the reception acknowledgement to your vendor.
- Accept or claim the document and send this status to your vendor.

#### Reception

As soon as the vendor email with the attached
`DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is received:

1.  The vendor bill maps all the information included in the XML.
2.  An email is sent to the vendor with the reception acknowledgement.
3.  The `DTE Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set as
    `Acuse de Recibido Enviado`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

#### Acceptation

If all the commercial information is correct on your vendor bill, then
you can accept the document using the
`Aceptar Documento`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. Once this
is done, the `DTE Acceptation
Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} changes to
`Accepted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and an email of acceptance
is sent to the vendor.

![Button for accepting vendor bills.](chile/accept-vendor-bill-btn.png){.align-center}

#### Claim

In case there is a commercial issue or the information is not correct on
your vendor bill, you can claim the document before validating it, using
the `Claim`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. Once this is
done, the `DTE Acceptation Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
changes to `Claim`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a rejection
email is sent to the vendor.

![Claim button in vendor bills to inform the vendor all the document is commercially
rejected.
:align: center](chile/claim-vendor-bill-btn.png)

If you claim a vendor bill, the status changes from
`Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to `Cancel`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} automatically. Considering this as best practice, all
the claimed documents should be canceled as they won\'t be valid for
your accounting records.

### Electronic purchase invoice

The *electronic purchase invoice* is a feature included in the
[l10n_cl_edi]{.title-ref} module.

Once all configurations have been made for
`electronic invoices <chile/electronic-invoice>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (e.g., uploading a valid company certificate, setting up
master data, etc.), the electronic purchase invoices need their own
`CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Please
refer to the
`CAF documentation <chile/caf-documentation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to check the details on how to acquire the
`CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for
electronic purchase invoices.

Electronic purchase invoices are useful when vendors are not obligated
to expedite an electronic vendor bill for your purchase. Still, your
obligations require a document to be sent to the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} as
proof of purchase.

#### Configuration

To generate an electronic purchase invoice from a vendor bill, the bill
must be created in a purchase journal with the *Use Documents* feature
enabled. It is possible to modify an existing purchase journal or create
a new one in the following process.

To modify the existing purchase journal, or create a new purchase
journal, navigate to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, and fill in the following required information:

- `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu
  for vendor bill journals.
- `Use Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: check this field
  so the journal can generate electronic documents (in this case the
  electronic purchase invoice).

#### Generate an electronic purchase invoice

To generate this type of document, it is necessary to create a vendor
bill in Odoo. To do so, navigate to
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Bills`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

When all of the electronic purchase invoice information is filled,
select the option `(46)
Electronic Purchase Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field:

After the vendor bill is posted:

- The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} file (Electronic Tax Document) is automatically created
  and added to the chatter.
- The `DTE SII Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set as
  `Pending to be sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Odoo automatically updates the *DTE Status* every night using a
scheduled action. To get a response from the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
immediately, click the `Send now to
SII`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

### Delivery guide

To install the `Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
module, go to `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and search
for [Chile (l10n_cl)]{.title-ref}. Then click
`Install`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the module
`Chile - E-Invoicing Delivery
Guide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`Chile - E-Invoicing Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
has a dependency with `Chile -
Facturación Electrónica`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Odoo will
install the dependency automatically when the
`Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} module is installed.
::::

The *Delivery Guide* module includes the ability to send the
`DTE (Documentos Tributarios
Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
and the stamp in PDF reports for deliveries.

Once all configurations have been made for
`electronic invoices <chile/electronic-invoice>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (e.g., uploading a valid company certificate, setting up
master data, etc.), delivery guides need their own
`CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Please
refer to the `CAF documentation
<chile/caf-documentation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to check the
details on how to acquire the `CAF (Folio
Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for electronic
Delivery Guides.

Verify the following important information in the
`Price for the Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
configuration:

- `From Sales Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: delivery guide
  takes the product price from the sales order and shows it on the
  document.
- `From Product Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Odoo takes
  the price configured in the product template and shows it on the
  document.
- `No show price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: no price is shown
  in the delivery guide.

Electronic delivery guides are used to move stock from one place to
another and they can represent sales, sampling, consignment, internal
transfers, and basically any product move.

#### Delivery guide from a sales process

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

A delivery guide should **not** be longer than one page or contain more
than 60 product lines.
::::

When a sales order is created and confirmed, a delivery order is
generated. After validating the delivery order, the option to create a
delivery guide is activated.

![Create Delivery Guide button on a sales process.](chile/delivery-guide-creation-btn.png){.align-center}

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

When clicking on `Create Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} for the first time, a warning message pops up, stating
the following:

[No se encontró una secuencia para la guía de despacho. Por favor,
establezca el primer número dentro del campo número para la guía de
despacho]{.title-ref}

![First Delivery Guide number warning message.](chile/delivery-guide-number-warning.png){.align-center}
::::

This warning message means the user needs to indicate the next sequence
number Odoo has to take to generate the delivery guide (e.g. next
available `CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} number), and only happens the first time a delivery guide
is created in Odoo. After the first document has been correctly
generated, Odoo takes the next available number in the
`CAF (Folio Authorization
Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} file to generate the following
delivery guide.

After the delivery guide is created:

- The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} file (Electronic Tax Document) is automatically created
  and added to the `chatter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- The `DTE SII Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set as
  `Pending to be sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Chatter notes of Delivery Guide creation.](chile/chatter-delivery-guide.png){.align-center}

The `DTE Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is automatically
updated by Odoo with a scheduled action that runs every night. To get a
response from the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
immediately, press the `Send now to SII`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

Once the delivery guide is sent, it may then be printed by clicking on
the `Print Delivery
Guide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

![Printing Delivery Guide PDF.](chile/print-delivery-guide-btn.png){.align-center}

Delivery guide will have fiscal elements that indicate that the document
is fiscally valid when printed (if hosted in *Odoo SH* or on
*On-premise* remember to manually add the `pdf417gen`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} library mentioned in the `Invoice PDF report section
<chile/electronic-invoice-pdf-report>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).

### Electronic receipt

To install the `Electronic Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
module, go to `Apps`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and search
for [Chile (l10n_cl)]{.title-ref}. Then click
`Install`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the module
`Chile - Electronic
Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`Chile - Electronic Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} has a
dependency with `Chile - Facturación
Electrónica`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Odoo will install the
dependency automatically when the `E-invoicing
Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} module is installed.
::::

Once all configurations have been made for
`electronic invoices <chile/electronic-invoice>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (e.g., uploading a valid company certificate, setting up
master data, etc.), electronic receipts need their own
`CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Please
refer to the `CAF documentation
<chile/caf-documentation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to check the
details on how to acquire the `CAFs (Folio
Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for electronic
receipts.

Electronic receipts are useful when clients do not need an electronic
invoice. By default, there is a partner in the database called
`Anonymous Final Consumer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with a
generic `RUT (Rol
Único Tributario)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
[66666666-6]{.title-ref} and taxpayer type of
`Final Consumer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This partner can be
used for electronic receipts or a new record may be created for the same
purpose.

![Electronic Receipt module.](chile/electronic-receipt-customer.png){.align-center}

Although electronic receipts should be used for final consumers with a
generic `RUT (Rol Único
Tributario)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, it can also be used for
specific partners. After the partners and journals are created and
configured, the electronic receipts are created in the standard way as
electronic invoice, but the type of document
`(39) Electronic Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should be
selected in the invoice form:

![Document type 39 for Electronic Receipts.](chile/document-type-39.png){.align-center}

#### Validation and DTE status

When all of the electronic receipt information is filled, manually (or
automatically) proceed to validate the receipt from the sales order. By
default, `Electronic Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
selected as the `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
however in order to validate the receipt correctly, make sure to edit
the `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and change to
`Electronic Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

After the receipt is posted:

- The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} file (Electronic Tax Document) is created automatically
  and added to the `chatter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- The `DTE SII Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set as
  `Pending to be sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Electronic Receipts STE creation status.](chile/electronic-receipt-ste-status.png){.align-center}

The `DTE Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is automatically
updated by Odoo with a scheduled action that runs every day at night. To
get a response from the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
immediately, press the `Send now to SII`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

Please refer to the
`DTE Workflow <chile/electronic-invoice-validation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for electronic invoices as the workflow for electronic
receipt follows the same process.

### Electronic export of goods

To install the `Electronic Exports of Goods`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} module, go to `Apps`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and search for [Chile (l10n_cl)]{.title-ref}. Then
click `Install`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the module
`Electronic
Exports of Goods for Chile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`Chile - Electronic Exports of Goods for Chile`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} has a dependency with `Chile
- Facturación Electrónica`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

Once all configurations have been made for
`electronic invoices <chile/electronic-invoice>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (e.g., uploading a valid company certificate, setting up
master data, etc.), electronic exports of goods need their own
`CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Please
refer to the `CAF
documentation <chile/caf-documentation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
to check the details on how to acquire the `CAFs
(Folio Authorization Code)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for
electronic receipts.

Electronic invoices for the export of goods are tax documents that are
used not only for the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
but are also used with customs and contain the information required by
it.

#### Contact configurations

![Taxpayer Type needed for the Electronic Exports of Goods module.](chile/taxpayer-type-export-goods.png){.align-center}

#### Chilean customs

When creating an electronic exports of goods invoice, these new fields
in the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab are required
to comply with Chilean regulations.

![Chilean customs fields.](chile/chilean-custom-fields.png){.align-center}

#### PDF report

Once the invoice is accepted and validated by the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
and the PDF is printed, it includes the fiscal elements that indicate
that the document is fiscally valid and a new section needed for
customs.

## Financial reports

### Balance tributario de 8 columnas

This report presents the accounts in detail (with their respective
balances), classifying them according to their origin and determining
the level of profit or loss that the business had within the evaluated
period of time.

You can find this report in
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Balance Sheet`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and selecting in the `Report`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field the option `Chilean Fiscal Balance (8 Columns)
(CL)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Chilean Fiscal Balance (8 Columns).](chile/8-col-fiscal-balance-report.png){.align-center}

### Propuesta F29

The form *F29* is a new system that the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
enabled to taxpayers, and that replaces the *Purchase and Sales Books*.
This report is integrated by Purchase Register (CR) and the Sales
Register (RV). Its purpose is to support the transactions related to
VAT, improving its control and declaration.

This record is supplied by the electronic tax documents (DTE\'s) that
have been received by the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

You can find this report in
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Reports`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and selecting the `Report`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option `Propuesta F29 (CL)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Location of the Propuesta F29 (CL) Report.](chile/locate-propuesta-f29-report.png){.align-center}

It is possible to set the
`PPM (Provisional Monthly Payments rate)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
and the `Proportional Factor for the fiscal year`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

# Colombia

Odoo\'s Colombian localization package provides accounting, fiscal, and
legal features for databases in Colombia -- such as chart of accounts,
taxes, and electronic invoicing.

In addition, a series of videos on the subject is also available. These
videos cover how to start from scratch, set up configurations, complete
common workflows, and provide in-depth looks at some specific use cases
as well.

information.

##### Identification information

Identification types, defined by the
`DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, are available on the partner form, as part of the
Colombian localization. Colombian partners **must** have their
`Identification Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (VAT) and
`Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

When the `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
[NIT]{.title-ref}, the `Identification Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} needs to be configured in Odoo, including the
*verification digit at the end of the ID, prefixed by a hyphen (\`-\`)*.
::::

##### Fiscal information

The partner\'s responsibility codes (section 53 in the
`RUT (Registro único tributario)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
document) are included as part of the electronic invoicing module, as it
is required by the
`DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

The required fields can be found under
`Partner --> Sales & Purchase Tab --> Fiscal
Information section`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}:

- `Obligaciones y Responsabilidades`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  Select the fiscal responsibility for the company ([O-13]{.title-ref}
  Gran Contribuyente, [O-15]{.title-ref} Autorretenedor,
  [O-23]{.title-ref} Agente de retención IVA, [O-47]{.title-ref} Regimen
  de tributación simple, or [R-99-PN]{.title-ref} No Aplica).

  company is *Gran Contribuyente* this option should be selected.
- `Fiscal Regimen`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  tribute name for the company ([IVA]{.title-ref}, [INC]{.title-ref},
  [IVA e INC]{.title-ref}, or [No Aplica]{.title-ref})
- `Commercial Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the company
  uses a specific commercial name, and it needs to be displayed in the
  invoice.

#### Products

To manage products, navigate to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then click on a product.

When adding general information on the product form, it is required that
either the `UNSPSC Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
(`Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab), or
`Internal Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
(`General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab) field is
configured. Be sure to `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the
product once configured.

#### Taxes

To create or modify taxes, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the related tax.

If sales transactions include products with taxes, the
`Value Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field in the
`Advanced Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab needs to be
configured per tax. Retention tax types (`ICA`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `IVA`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Fuente`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) are also included. This
configuration is used to display taxes correctly in the invoice PDF.

![The ICA, IVA and Fuente fields in the Advanced Options tab in Odoo.](colombia/retention-tax-types.png){.align-center}

#### Sales journals {#co-journals}

Once the
`DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} has assigned the official sequence and prefix for the
electronic invoice resolution, the sales journals related to the invoice
documents **must** be updated in Odoo. To do so, navigate to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select an existing sales journal, or create a
new one with the `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

On the sales journal form, input the `Journal Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and set a
unique `Short Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Journals Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Then,
configure the following data in the
`Advanced Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:

- `Electronic invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enable
  `UBL 2.1 (Colombia)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Invoicing Resolution`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Resolution
  number issued by
  `DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} to the company.
- `Resolution Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Initial
  effective date of the resolution.
- `Resolution end date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: End date of
  the resolution\'s validity.
- `Range of Numbering (minimum)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  First authorized invoice number.
- `Range of Numbering (maximum)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  Last authorized invoice number.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The sequence and resolution of the journal **must** match the one
configured in Carvajal and the
`DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.
::::

##### Invoice sequence

The invoice sequence and prefix **must** be correctly configured when
the first document is created.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Odoo automatically assigns a prefix and sequence to the following
invoices.
::::

##### Purchase journals

Once the
`DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} has assigned the official sequence and prefix for the
*support document* related to vendor bills, the purchase journals
related to their supporting documents need to be updated in Odoo. The
process is similar to the configuration of the
`sales journals <co-journals>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

##### Chart of accounts

The
`chart of accounts </applications/finance/accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is installed by default as part of the localization module,
the accounts are mapped automatically in taxes, default account payable,
and default account receivable. The chart of accounts for Colombia is
based on the PUC (Plan Unico de Cuentas).

## Main workflows {#colombia/workflows}

### Electronic invoices

The following is a breakdown of the main workflow for electronic
invoices with the Colombian localization:

1.  Sender creates an invoice.
2.  Electronic invoice provider generates the legal XML file.
3.  Electronic invoice provider creates the CUFE (Invoice Electronic
    Code) with the electronic signature.
4.  Electronic invoice provider sends a notification to
    `DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"}.
5.  `DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} validates the invoice.
6.  `DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
    role="abbr"} accepts or rejects the invoice.
7.  Electronic invoice provider generates the PDF invoice with a QR
    code.
8.  Electronic invoice provider sends invoice to the acquirer.
9.  Acquirer sends a receipt of acknowledgement, and accepts or rejects
    the invoice.
10. Sender downloads a `.zip`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file with
    the PDF and XML.

![Electronic invoice workflow for Colombian localization.](colombia/workflow-electronic-invoice.png){.align-center}

#### Invoice creation {#colombia/invoice-creation}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The functional workflow taking place before an invoice validation does
**not** alter the main changes introduced with the electronic invoice.
::::

Electronic invoices are generated and sent to both the
`DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and customer through Carvajal\'s web service integration.
These documents can be created from your sales order or manually
generated. To create a new invoice, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. On the invoice form configure the following fields:

- `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Customer\'s
  information.
- `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Journal used for
  electronic invoices.
- `Electronic Invoice Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
  the type of document. By default, `Factura
  de Venta`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected.
- `Invoice Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Specify the
  products with the correct taxes.

When done, click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

#### Invoice validation {#colombia/invoice-validation}

After the invoice confirmation, an XML file is created and sent
automatically to Carvajal. The invoice is then processed asynchronously
by the E-invoicing service UBL 2.1 (Colombia). The file is also
displayed in the chatter.

![Carvajal XML invoice file in Odoo chatter.](colombia/invoice-sent.png){.align-center}

The `Electronic Invoice Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
is now displayed in the `EDI Documents`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, with the name of the XML file. Additionally, the
`Electronic Invoice Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
displayed with the initial value `To Send`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. To process the invoice manually, click on the
`Process Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

#### Reception of legal XML and PDF {#colombia/invoice-xml}

The electronic invoice vendor (Carvajal) receives the XML file, and
proceeds to validate its structure and information.

After validating the electronic invoice, proceed to generate a legal XML
which includes a digital signature and a unique code (CUFE), a PDF
invoice that includes a QR code and the CUFE is also generated. If
everything is correct the `Electronic Invoicing`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field value changes to `Sent`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

A `.zip`{.interpreted-text role="file"} containing the legal electronic
invoice (in XML format) and the invoice in (PDF format) is downloaded
and displayed in the invoice chatter:

![ZIP file displayed in the invoice chatter in Odoo.](colombia/invoice-zip.png){.align-center}

The electronic invoice status changes to `Accepted`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

### Credit notes

The process for credit notes is the same as for invoices. To create a
credit note with reference to an invoice, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. On the invoice, click
`Add Credit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and complete the
following information:

- `Credit Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the type of
  credit method.
  - `Partial Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Use this option
    when it is a partial amount.
  - `Full Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Use this option if
    the credit note is for the full amount.
  - `Full refund and new draft invoice`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}: Use this option if the credit note is
    auto-validated and reconciled with the invoice. The original invoice
    is duplicated as a new draft.
- `Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the reason for the
  credit note.
- `Reversal Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select if you want
  a specific date for the credit note or if it is the journal entry
  date.
- `Use Specific Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  journal for your credit note or leave it empty if you want to use the
  same journal as the original invoice.
- `Refund Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If you chose a
  specific date, select the date for the refund.

Once reviewed, click the `Reverse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button.

### Debit notes

The process for debit notes is similar to credit notes. To create a
debit note with reference to an invoice, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. On the invoice, click the
`Add Debit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and enter
the following information:

- `Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Type the reason for the
  debit note.
- `Debit note date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  specific options.
- `Copy lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select this option if
  you need to register a debit note with the same lines of invoice.
- `Use Specific Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  printer point for your debit note, or leave it empty if you want to
  use the same journal as the original invoice.

When done, click `Create Debit Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Support document for vendor bills

With master data, credentials, and the purchase journal configured for
support documents related to vendor bills, you can start using *support
documents*.

Support documents for vendor bills can be created from your purchase
order or manually. Go to
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Bills`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and fill in the following data:

- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the vendor\'s
  information.
- `Bill Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the date of the
  bill.
- `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the journal for
  support documents related to the vendor bills.
- `Invoiced Lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Specify the
  products with the correct taxes.

Once reviewed, click the `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

cases, error messages are shown in the chatter after updating the
electronic invoice status.

After the master data is corrected, it\'s possible to reprocess the XML
with the new data and send the updated version, using the
`Retry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

role="doc"} is installed by default as part of the set of data included
in the localization module, the accounts are mapped automatically in
Taxes, Default Account Payable, Default Account Receivable.

The chart of accounts for Ecuador is based on the most updated version
of Superintendency of Companies, which is grouped in several categories
and is compatible with NIIF accounting.

You can add or delete accounts according to the company\'s needs.

#### Products

In addition to the basic information in your products, you must add the
configuration of the withholding code (tax) that applies.

Go to `Accounting --> Vendors:  Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} under the tab \"Purchase\"

![Product for Ecuador.](ecuador/products.png){.align-center}

#### Contacts

Configure the next information when you create a contact:

- Check the `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option on top
  if it is a contact with RUC, or check `Individual`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} if it is a contact with cedula or passport.
- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `Street`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is a required field to

the configuration of which VAT and Profit withholding will apply when
you use this contact on Vendor Bill, and then create a withholding from
there.
::::

#### Review your taxes

As part of the localization module, taxes are automatically created with
its configuration and related financial accounts.

![Taxes for Ecuador.](ecuador/taxes.png){.align-center}

The following options have been automatically configured:

- `Tax Support`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to be configured
  only in the IVA tax, this option is useful when you register purchase
  withholdings.
- `Code ATS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: to be configured only
  for income tax withholding codes, it is important when you register
  the withholding.
- `Tax Grids`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: configure the codes of
  104 form if it is a IVA tax and configure the codes of 103 form if it
  is a income tax withholding code.
- `Tax Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  - For IVA tax, format the name as: [IVA \[percent\] (104, \[form
    code\] \[tax support code\] \[tax support short name\])]{.title-ref}
  - For income tax withholding code, format the name as: [Code ATS
    \[Percent of withhold\] \[withhold name\]]{.title-ref}

Once the Ecuador module is installed, the most common taxes are
automatically configured. If you need to create an additional one, you
can do so, for which you must base yourself on the configuration of the
existing taxes.

![Taxes with tax support for Ecuador.](ecuador/taxes-with-tax-support.png){.align-center}

#### Review your Document Types

Some accounting transactions like *Customer Invoices* and *Vendor Bills*
are classified by document types. These are defined by the government
fiscal authorities, in this case by the SRI.

Each document type can have a unique sequence per journal where it is
assigned. As part of the localization, the document type includes the
country on which the document is applicable; also the data is created
automatically when the localization module is installed.

The information required for the document types is included by default
so the user does not need to fill anything there.

![Document types for Ecuador.](ecuador/document-types.png){.align-center}

- Purchase of goods or services from natural persons not registered with
  a RUC, who due to their cultural level or hardiness are not able to
  issue sales receipts or customer invoices.
- Reimbursement for the purchase of goods or services to employees in a
  dependency relationship (full-time employee).
- Services provided by members of collegiate bodies for the exercise of
  their function.

These types of electronic documents can be created from the
`Purchase Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or manually from the
`Vendor Bills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form view. It must
contain the following data:

- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: type the vendor\'s
  information.
- `Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the journal for
  the `Purchase Liquidation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with the
  correct printer point.
- `Document Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this is the
  document type [(03) Purchase Liquidation]{.title-ref}
- `Document number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: type the
  document number (sequence), you will only have to do this once, then
  the sequence will be automatically assigned for the next documents.
- `Payment Method (SRI)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select how
  the invoice is going to be paid.
- `Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: specify the product
  with the correct taxes.

Once you review the information you can validate the
`Purchase Liquidation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Purchase liquidation for Ecuador.](ecuador/purchase-liquidation.png){.align-center}

#### Purchase withholding

The `Purchase withholding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is an
electronic document that, when validated, is sent to SRI.

It is necessary to have an invoice in a validated state in order to
register a `Purchase
withholding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. On the invoice, there
is a button named `Add Withhold`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
click on this button to be directed to the
`Withholding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form, then complete the
following information:

- `Document number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: type the
  document number (sequence), you will only have to do this once, then
  the sequence will be automatically assigned for the next documents.
- `Withhold lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The taxes appear
  automatically according to the configuration of products and vendors,
  you should review if the taxes and tax support are correct, and, if it
  is not correct, you can edit and select the correct taxes and tax
  support.

Once you review the information you can validate the
`Withholding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Purchase withhold for Ecuador.](ecuador/purchase-withhold.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

You can\'t change the tax support for one that was not included in the
configuration of the taxes used on the `Vendor Bill`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. To do so, go to the tax applied on the `Vendor
Bill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and change the
`Tax Support`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} there.
::::

A withholding tax can be divided into two or more lines, this will
depend on whether two or more withholdings percentages apply.

::: example
The system suggests a VAT withholding of 30% with tax support 01, you
can add your VAT withholding of 70% in a new line with the same tax
support, the system will allow you as long as the total of the bases
matches the total from the `Vendor Bill`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
:::

## Financial Reports

In Ecuador, there are fiscal reports that the company presents to SRI.
In Odoo, we have two of the main financial reports used by companies.
These are the reports 103 and 104.

To get these reports go to the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} app and select `Reporting -->
Statements Reports --> Tax Report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and then filter by [Tax Report 103]{.title-ref} or
[Tax Report 104]{.title-ref}.

### Report 103

This report contains information of income tax withholdings in a given
period, this can be reported monthly or semi-annually.

You can see the information needed to report, which includes base and
tax amounts, which also includes the tax code within the parenthesis in
order to report it to the SRI.

![Report 103 form for Ecuador.](ecuador/103-form.png){.align-center}

### Report 104

This report contains information on VAT tax and VAT withholding for a
given period, this can be monthly or semi-annually.

You can see the information needed to report, which includes base and
tax amounts, which also includes the tax code within the parenthesis in
order to report it to the SRI.

![Report 104 form for Ecuador.](ecuador/104-form.png){.align-center}

### ATS report

`Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the *ATS
Report* ([l10n_ec_reports_ats]{.title-ref}) module to enable downloading
the ATS report in XML format.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The Ecuadorian *ATS Report* module is dependent on the previous
installation of the *Accounting* app and the *Ecuadorian EDI module*.
::::

#### Configuration

To issue electronic documents, ensure your company is configured as
explained in the
`electronic invoice <l10n_ec/configure-your-company>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} section.

In the `ATS (Anexo Transaccional Simplificado)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, every document generated in Odoo (invoices, vendor bills,
sales and purchases withholdings, credit notes, and debit notes) will be
included.

##### Vendor bills

When generating a vendor bill, it is necessary to register the
authorization number from the invoice that the vendor generated for the
purchase. To do so, go to `Accounting
--> Vendors --> Bills`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
select the bill. Then, enter the number from the vendor\'s invoice in
the `Authorization Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

##### Credit and debit notes

When generating a credit note or debit note manually or through
importation, it is necessary to link this note to the sales invoice that
is being modified by it.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Remember to add all required information to the documents before
downloading the `ATS
(Anexo Transaccional Simplificado)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} file.
For example, add the *Authorization Number* and the *SRI Payment Method*
on documents, when needed.
::::

#### XML generation

To generate the
`ATS (Anexo Transaccional Simplificado)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
report, go to `Accounting --> Reports --> Tax Report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and choose a time period for the desired
`ATS (Anexo Transaccional Simplificado)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
report, then click `ATS`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The downloaded XML file is ready to be uploaded to *DIMM Formularios*.

![ATS report download for Ecuador in Odoo Accounting.](ecuador/ats-report.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When downloading the
`ATS (Anexo Transaccional Simplificado)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
report, Odoo generates a warning pop-up alerting the user if a
document(s) has missing or incorrect data. Nevertheless, the user can
still download the XML file.

not done yet, fill out your company details with your company\'s full
address, country, and Tax ID.
::::

#### ETA codes {#egypt/e-invoicing-eta-codes}

E-invoicing works with a set of codes provided by the ETA. You can use
the [ETA documentation](https://sdk.preprod.invoicing.eta.gov.eg/codes/)
to code your business attributes.

Most of these codes are handled automatically by Odoo, provided that
your `branches
<egypt/e-invoicing-branches>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`customers <egypt/e-invoicing-customers>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
and `products
<egypt/e-invoicing-products>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are
correctly configured.

- Company Information:
  - Company Tax ID

  - | Branch ID
    | If you have only one branch, use `0` as the branch code.

  - Activity type Code
- Other Information:
  - | Product Codes
    | Your company\'s products should be coded and matched with their
      **GS1** or **EGS** codes.

  - | Tax Codes
    | Most of the taxes codes are already configured on Odoo in the
      `ETA Code (Egypt)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. We
      advise you to make sure these codes match your company\'s taxes.

You must `install <../../general/apps_modules>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} the **France - Adding Mandatory Invoice Mentions (Decree no.
2022-1299)** ([l10n_fr_invoice_addr]{.title-ref}) module to comply with
the [local

## FEC - Fichier des Écritures Comptables {#france/fec}

An FEC `Fichier des Écritures Comptables`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}
audit file contains all the accounting data and entries recorded in all
the accounting journals for a financial year. The entries in the file
must be arranged in chronological order.

Since January 1st, 2014, every French company is required to produce and
transmit this file upon request by the tax authorities for audit
purposes.

### FEC Import

To make the onboarding of new users easier, Odoo Enterprise\'s French
`fiscal localization
package <fiscal_localizations/packages>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
includes the **FEC Import** feature (module name: `l10n_fr_fec_import`),
which enables the import of existing FEC files from older software.

To enable this feature, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings -->
Accounting Import`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, enable **FEC
Import**, and *Save*.

Next, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> FEC Import`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, upload your FEC file, and click on *Import*.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

| Importing FEC files from different year takes no particular action or
  computation.
| Should multiple files contain any \"Reports à Nouveaux\" (RAN) with
  the starting balance of the year, you might need to cancel those
  entries in the User Interface. Odoo makes those entries (RAN) useless.
::::

#### File formats

FEC files can only be in CSV format, as the XML format is not supported.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The FEC CSV file has a plain text format representing a data table, with
the first line being a header and defining the list of fields for each
entry, and each following line representing one accounting entry, in no
predetermined order.
::::

Our module expects the files to meet the following technical
specifications:

- **Encoding**: UTF-8, UTF-8-SIG and iso8859_15.
- **Separator**: any of these: [;]{.title-ref} or [\|]{.title-ref} or
  [,]{.title-ref} or [TAB]{.title-ref}.
- **Line terminators**: both CR+LF ([rn]{.title-ref}) and LF
  ([n]{.title-ref}) character groups are supported.
- **Date format**: [%Y%m%d]{.title-ref}

#### Implementation details

The following accounting entities are imported from the FEC files:
**Accounts, Journals, Partners**, and **Moves**.

Our module determines the encoding, the line-terminator character, and
the separator that are used in the file.

A check is then performed to see if every line has the correct number of
fields corresponding to the header.

If the check passes, then the file is read in full, kept in memory, and
scanned. Accounting entities are imported one type at a time, in the
following order.

##### Accounts

Every accounting entry is related to an account, which should be
determined by the field [CompteNum]{.title-ref}.

##### Code matching

Should a similar account code already be present in the system, the
existing one is used instead of creating a new one.

Accounts in Odoo generally have a number of digits that are default for
the fiscal localization. As the FEC module is related to the French
localization, the default number of relevant digits is 6.

This means that the account codes the trailing zeroes are right-trimmed,
and that the comparison between the account codes in the FEC file and
the ones already existing in Odoo is performed only on the first six
digits of the codes.

::: example
The account code [65800000]{.title-ref} in the file is matched against
an existing [658000]{.title-ref} account in Odoo, and that account is
used instead of creating a new one.
:::

##### Reconcilable flag

An account is technically flagged as *reconcilable* if the first line in
which it appears has the [EcritureLet]{.title-ref} field filled out, as
this flag means that the accounting entry is going to be reconciled with
another one.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In case the line somehow has this field not filled out, but the entry
still has to be reconciled with a payment that hasn\'t yet been
recorded, this isn\'t a problem anyway; the account is flagged as
reconcilable as soon as the import of the move lines requires it.
::::

##### Account type and Templates matching

As the **type** of the account is not specified in the FEC format,
**new** accounts are created with the default type *Current Assets* and
then, at the end of the import process, they are matched against the
installed Chart of Account templates. Also, the *reconcile* flag is also
computed this way.

The match is done with the left-most digits, starting by using all
digits, then 3, then 2.

::: example
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Name         Code                     Full comparison          3-digits comparison 2-digits
                                                                                     comparison
  ------------ ------------------------ ------------------------ ------------------- ------------------
  Template     [400000]{.title-ref}     [400000]{.title-ref}     [400]{.title-ref}   [40]{.title-ref}

  CompteNum    [40100000]{.title-ref}   [40100000]{.title-ref}   [401]{.title-ref}   [40]{.title-ref}

  **Result**                                                                         Match **found**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

The type of the account is then flagged as *payable* and *reconcilable*
as per the account template.

##### Journals

Journals are also checked against those already existing in Odoo to
avoid duplicates, also in the case of multiple FEC files imports.

Should a similar journal code already be present in the system, the
existing one is used instead of creating a new one.

New journals have their name prefixed by the string `FEC-`.

::: example
[ACHATS]{.title-ref} -\> [FEC-ACHATS]{.title-ref}
:::

The journals are *not* archived, the user is entitled to handle them as
he wishes.

##### Journal type determination

The journal type is also not specified in the format (as per the
accounts) and therefore it is at first created with the default type
[general]{.title-ref}.

At the end of the import process, the type is determined as per these
rules regarding related moves and accounts:

- | \`bank\`: Moves in these journals always have a line (debit or
    credit) impacting a liquidity account.
  | [cash]{.title-ref} / [bank]{.title-ref} can be interchanged, so
    [bank]{.title-ref} is set everywhere when this condition is met.

- | \`sale\`: Moves in these journals mostly have debit lines on
    receivable accounts and credit lines on tax income accounts.
  | Sale refund journal items are debit/credit inverted.

- | \`purchase\`: Moves in these journals mostly have credit lines on
    payable accounts and debit lines on expense accounts.
  | Purchase refund journal items are debit/credit inverted.

- | \`general\`: for everything else.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

- A minimum of three moves is necessary for journal type identification.
- A threshold of 70% of moves must correspond to a criteria for a
  journal type to be determined.
::::

::: example
Suppose we are analyzing the moves that share a certain
[journal_id]{.title-ref}.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Moves                                                Count   Percentage
  ---------------------------------------------------- ------- ------------
  that have a sale account line and no purchase        0       0
  account line                                                 

  that have a purchase account line and no sale        1       25%
  account line                                                 

  that have a liquidity account line                   3       **75%**

  **Total**                                            4       100%
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

The journal [type]{.title-ref} would be [bank]{.title-ref}, because the
bank moves percentage (75%) exceeds the threshold (70%).
:::

##### Partners

Each partner keeps its [Reference]{.title-ref} from the field
[CompAuxNum]{.title-ref}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

These fields are searchable, in line with former FEC imports on the
accounting expert\'s side for fiscal/audit purposes.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Users can merge partners with the Data Cleaning App, where Vendors and
Customers or similar partner entries may be merged by the user, with
assistance from the system that groups them by similar entries.
::::

##### Moves

Entries are immediately posted and reconciled after submission, using
the [EcritureLet]{.title-ref} field to do the matching between the
entries themselves.

The [EcritureNum]{.title-ref} field represents the name of the moves. We
noticed that sometimes it may not be filled out. In this case, the field
[PieceRef]{.title-ref} is used.

##### Rounding issues

There is a rounding tolerance with a currency-related precision on debit
and credit (i.e., 0.01 for EUR). Under this tolerance, a new line is
added to the move, named *Import rounding difference*, targeting the
accounts:

- [658000]{.title-ref} Charges diverses de gestion courante, for added
  debits
- [758000]{.title-ref} Produits divers de gestion courante, for added
  credits

##### Missing move name

Should the [EcritureNum]{.title-ref} not be filled out, it may also
happen that the [PieceRef]{.title-ref} field is also not suited to
determine the move name (it may be used as an accounting move line
reference) leaving no way to actually find which lines are to be grouped
in a single move, and effectively impeding the creation of balanced
moves.

One last attempt is made, grouping all lines from the same journal and
date ([JournalLib]{.title-ref}, [EcritureDate]{.title-ref}). Should this
grouping generate balanced moves (sum(credit) - sum(debit) = 0), then
each different combination of journal and date creates a new move.

::: example
[ACH]{.title-ref} + [2021/05/01]{.title-ref} \--\> new move on journal
[ACH]{.title-ref} with name [20210501]{.title-ref}.
:::

Should this attempt fail, the user is prompted an error message with all
the move lines that are supposedly unbalanced.

##### Partner information

If a line has the partner information specified, the information is
copied to the accounting move itself if the targeted Journal is of type
*payable* or *receivable*.

## Get the VAT anti-fraud certification with Odoo

As of January 1st 2018, a new anti-fraud legislation comes into effect
in France and DOM-TOM. This new legislation stipulates certain criteria
concerning the inalterability, security, storage and archiving of sales
data. These legal requirements are implemented in Odoo, version 9
onward, through a module and a certificate of conformity to download.

### Is my company required to use anti-fraud software?

Your company is required to use an anti-fraud cash register software
like Odoo (CGI art. 286, I. 3° bis) if:

- You are taxable (not VAT exempt) in France or any DOM-TOM,
- Some of your customers are private individuals (B2C).

This rule applies to any company size. Auto-entrepreneurs are exempted
from VAT and therefore are not affected.

### Get certified with Odoo

Getting compliant with Odoo is very easy.

Your company is requested by the tax administration to deliver a
certificate of conformity testifying that your software complies with
the anti-fraud legislation. This certificate is granted by Odoo SA to
Odoo Enterprise users
[here](https://www.odoo.com/my/contract/french-certification/). If you
use Odoo Community, you should `upgrade to Odoo Enterprise
</administration/on_premise/community_to_enterprise>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} or contact your Odoo service provider.

In case of non-conformity, your company risks a fine of €7,500.

To get the certification, just follow the following steps:

- If you use **Odoo Point of Sale**,
  `install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
  **France - VAT Anti-Fraud Certification for Point of Sale (CGI 286 I-3
  bis)** module by going to `Apps`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}, removing the *Apps* filter, then searching for
  *l10n_fr_pos_cert*, and installing the module.
- Make sure a country is set on your company, otherwise your entries
  won't be encrypted for the inalterability check. To edit your
  company's data, go to
  `Settings --> Users & Companies --> Companies`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}. Select a country from the list; Do not create a
  new country.
- Download the mandatory certificate of conformity delivered by Odoo SA
  [here](https://www.odoo.com/my/contract/french-certification/).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

- To install the module in any system created before December 18th 2017,
  you should update the modules list. To do so, activate the
  `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Then
  go to the *Apps* menu and press *Update Modules List* in the top-menu.
- In case you run Odoo on-premise, you need to update your installation
  and restart your server beforehand.
- If you have installed the initial version of the anti-fraud module
  (prior to December 18th 2017), you need to update it. The module\'s
  name was *France - Accounting - Certified CGI 286 I-3 bis*. After an
  update of the modules list, search for the updated module in *Apps*,
  select it and click *Upgrade*. Finally, make sure the following module
  *l10n_fr_sale_closing* is installed.
::::

### Anti-fraud features

The anti-fraud module introduces the following features:

- **Inalterability**: deactivation of all the ways to cancel or modify
  key data of POS orders, invoices and journal entries;
- **Security**: chaining algorithm to verify the inalterability;
- **Storage**: automatic sales closings with computation of both period
  and cumulative totals (daily, monthly, annually).

#### Inalterability

All the possible ways to cancel and modify key data of paid POS orders,
confirmed invoices and journal entries are deactivated, if the company
is located in France or in any DOM-TOM.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If you run a multi-companies environment, only the documents of such
companies are impacted.
::::

#### Security

To ensure inalterability, every order or journal entry is encrypted upon
validation. This number (or hash) is calculated from the key data of the
document as well as from the hash of the precedent documents.

The module introduces an interface to test the data inalterability. If
any information is modified on a document after its validation, the test
will fail. The algorithm recomputes all the hashes and compares them
against the initial ones. In case of failure, the system points out the
first corrupted document recorded in the system.

Users with *Manager* access rights can launch the inalterability check.
For POS orders, go to
`Point of Sales --> Reporting --> French Statements`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. For invoices or journal entries, go to
`Invoicing/Accounting --> Reporting --> French Statements`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

#### Storage

The system also processes automatic sales closings on a daily, monthly
and annual basis. Such closings distinctly compute the sales total of
the period as well as the cumulative grand totals from the very first
sales entry recorded in the system.

Closings can be found in the *French Statements* menu of Point of Sale,
Invoicing and Accounting apps.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

- Closings compute the totals for journal entries of sales journals
  (Journal Type = Sales).
- For multi-companies environments, such closings are performed by
  company.
- POS orders are posted as journal entries at the closing of the POS
  session. Closing a POS session can be done anytime. To prompt users to
  do it on a daily basis, the module prevents from resuming a session
  opened more than 24 hours ago. Such a session must be closed before
  selling again.
- A period's total is computed from all the journal entries posted after
  the previous closing of the same type, regardless of their posting
  date. If you record a new sales transaction for a period already
  closed, it will be counted in the very next closing.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

- For test & audit purposes such closings can be manually generated in
  the `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
- Then go to
  `Settings --> Technical --> Automation --> Scheduled Actions`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}.
::::

### Responsibilities

Do not uninstall the module! If you do so, the hashes will be reset and
none of your past data will be longer guaranteed as being inalterable.

Users remain responsible for their Odoo instance and must use it with
due diligence. It is not permitted to modify the source code which
guarantees the inalterability of data.

Odoo absolves itself of all and any responsibility in case of changes in
the module's functions caused by 3rd party applications not certified by
Odoo.

#### Create and link a Technical Security System to your PoS

![Create TSS option from a point of sale](germany/create-tss.png){.align-right}

To use your point of sale in Germany, you first have to create a
`TSS (Technical Security
System)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for it.

To do so, go to
`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Point of Sale`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, open the point of sale you want to edit, then
check the box next to **Create TSS** and *Save*.

![Example of TSS ID and Client ID from fiskaly in Odoo Point of Sale](germany/tss-ids.png){.align-right}

Once the creation of the TSS is successful, you can find your **TSS ID**
and **Client ID** under the *fiskaly API* section.

- **TSS ID** refers to the ID of your TSS at fiskaly\'s side.
- **Client ID** refers to your PoS but at fiskaly\'s side.

### DSFinV-K

![Menu to export DSFinV-K](germany/dsfinv-k-export.png){.align-right}

Whenever you close a PoS session, the orders\' details are sent to the
`DSFinV-K (Digitale
Schnittstelle der Finanzverwaltung für Kassensysteme)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} service of fiskaly.

In case of an audit, you can export the data sent to DSFinV-K by going
to `Point of
Sale --> Orders --> DSFinV-k exports`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

These fields are mandatory:

- **Name**
- **Start Datetime** (export data with dates larger than or equal to the
  given start date)
- **End Datetime** (export data with dates smaller than or equal to the
  given end date)

Leave the **Point of Sale** field blank if you want to export the data
of all your points of sale. Specify a Point of Sale if you want to
export this specific PoS\' data only.

The creation of a DSFinV-K export triggers on export at fiskaly\'s side.

![Pending DSFinV-K export on Odoo](germany/dsfinv-k-export-fields.png){.align-center}

As you can see, the **State** is *Pending*. This means that the export

click on *Refresh State* to check if it is ready.

## German Tax Accounting Standards: Odoo\'s guide to GoBD Compliance {#germany/gobd}

**GoBD** stands for *Grundsätze zur ordnungsmäßigen Führung und
Aufbewahrung von Büchern, Aufzeichnungen und Unterlagen in
elektronischer Form sowie zum Datenzugriff*. In short, it is a
**guideline for the proper management and storage of books, records, and
documents in electronic form, as well as for data access**, that is
relevant for the German tax authority, tax declaration, and balance
sheet.

These principles have been written and published by the Federal Ministry
of Finance (BMF) in November 2014. Since January 2015, **they have
become the norm** and replace previously accepted practices linked to
computer-based accounting. Several changes have been made by the BMF in
2019 and January 2020 to specify some of the content and due to the
development of digital solutions (cloud hosting, paperless companies,
etc.).

text](https://ao.bundesfinanzministerium.de/ao/2021/Anhaenge/BMF-Schreiben-und-gleichlautende-Laendererlasse/Anhang-64/anhang-64.html).
It is a bit long but quite readable for non-experts. But in short, here
is what to expect:
::::

The **GoBD is binding for companies that have to present accounts, which
includes SMEs, freelancers, and entrepreneurs, to the financial
authorities**. As such, **the taxpayer himself is the sole responsible**
for the complete and exhaustive keeping of fiscal-relevant data
(above-mentioned financial and related data).

Apart from software requirements, the user is required to ensure
Internal control systems (*in accordance with sec. 146 of the Fiscal
Code*):

- Access rights control;
- Segregation of Duties, Functional separating;
- Entry controls (error notifications, plausibility checks);
- Reconciliation checks at data entry;
- Processing controls;
- Measures to prevent intentional or unintentional manipulation of
  software, data, or documents.

The user must distribute tasks within its organization to the relevant
positions (*control*) and verify that the tasks are properly and
completely performed (*supervision*). The result of these controls must
be recorded (*documentation*), and should errors be found during these
controls, appropriate measures to correct the situation should be put
into place (*prevention*).

### What about data security?

**The taxpayer must secure the system against any data loss due to
deletion, removal, or theft of any data**. If the entries are not
sufficiently secured, the bookkeeping will be regarded as not in
accordance with the GoBD guidelines.

Once bookings have been finally posted, they can no longer be changed or
deleted via the application.

- If Odoo is used in the cloud, regular backups are part of the Odoo
  Online service. In addition, regular backups can be downloaded and
  backed up on external systems.

  ::: seealso
  [Odoo Cloud Hosting - Service Level
  Agreement](https://www.odooo.com/cloud-sla)
  :::

- If the server is operated locally, it is the responsibility of the
  user to create the necessary backup infrastructure.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

In some cases, data has to be kept for ten years or more, so always have
backups saved. It is even more important if you decide to change
software provider.
::::

### Responsibility of the software editor

Considering GoBD only applies between the taxpayer and the financial
authority, **the software editor can by no means be held responsible for
the accurate and compliant documentation of financial transactional data
of their users**. It can merely provide the necessary tools for the user
to respect the software related guidelines described in the GoBD.

### How can Odoo help you achieve Compliance?

The key words, when it comes to GoBD, are: **traceable, verifiable,
true, clear, and continuous**. In short, you need to have audit-proof
archiving in place and Odoo provides you with the means to achieve all
of these objectives:

1.  | **Traceability and verifiability**
    | Each record in Odoo is stamped with the creator of the document,
      the creation date, the modification date, and who modified it. In
      addition, relevant fields are tracked thus it can be seen which
      value was changed by whom in the chatter of the relevant object.

2.  | **Completeness**
    | All financial data must be recorded in the system, and there can
      be no gaps. Odoo ensures that there is no gap in the numbering of
      the financial transactions. It is the responsibility of the user
      to encode all financial data in the system. As most financial data
      in Odoo is generated automatically, it remains the responsibility
      of the user to encode all vendor bills and miscellaneous
      operations completely.

3.  | **Accuracy**
    | Odoo ensures with the correct configuration that the correct
      accounts are used. In addition, the control mechanisms between
      purchase orders and sales orders and their respective invoices
      reflect the business reality. It is the responsibility of the user
      to scan and attach the paper-based vendor bill to the respective
      record in Odoo. *Odoo Document helps you automate this task*.

4.  | **Timely booking and record-keeping**
    | As most financial data in Odoo is generated by the transactional
      objects (for example, the invoice is booked at confirmation), Odoo
      ensures out-of-the-box timely record-keeping. It is the
      responsibility of the user to encode all incoming vendor bills in
      a timely manner, as well as the miscellaneous operations.

5.  | **Order**
    | Financial data stored in Odoo is per definition ordered and can be
      reordered according to most fields present in the model. A
      specific ordering is not enforced by the GoBD, but the system must
      ensure that a given financial transaction can be quickly found by
      a third-party expert. Odoo ensures this out-of-the-box.

6.  | **Inalterability**
    | With the German Odoo localization, Odoo is in standard configured
      in such a way that the inalterability clause can be adhered to
      without any further customization.

### Do you need a GoBD-Export?

In the case of fiscal control, the fiscal authority can request three
levels of access to the accounting system (Z1, Z2, Z3). These levels
vary from direct access to the interface to the handover of the
financial data on a storage device.

In case of a handover of the financial data on a storage device, the
format is **not** enforced by the GoBD. It can be, for example, in XLS,
CSV, XML, Lotus 123, SAP-format, AS/400-format, or else. Odoo supports
the CSV and XLS-export of financial data out-of-the-box. The GoBD
**recommends** the export in a specific XML-based GoBD-format (see
\"Ergänzende Informationen zur Datenntträgerüberlassung\" §3) but it is
not binding.

### What is the role and meaning of the compliance certification?

The GoBD clearly states that due to the nature of a state of the art
accounting software, their configuration possibilities, changing nature,
and various forms of use, **no legally binding certification can be
given**, nor can the software be made liable towards a public authority.
Third-party certificates can indeed have **an informative value** for
customers to make software buying decisions but are by no means legally
binding or of any other legal value (A. 12, § 181).

A GoBD certificate states nothing more than that if you use the software
according to its guidelines, the software will not refrain you from
respecting the GoBD. These certifications are very expensive in terms of
time and cost, and their value is very relative. Thus we focus our
efforts on ensuring GoBD compliance rather than pay for a marketing tool
which does not, however, offer our customer any legal certainty.

The BMF actually states the following in the [Official GoBD
text](https://ao.bundesfinanzministerium.de/ao/2021/Anhaenge/BMF-Schreiben-und-gleichlautende-Laendererlasse/Anhang-64/anhang-64.html):

- 180\. Positive attestations on the correctness of the bookkeeping -
  and thus on the correctness of IT-based bookkeeping systems - are not
  issued either in the context of a tax field audit or in the context of
  binding information.
- 181\. \"Certificates\" or \"attestations\" from third parties can
  serve as a decision criterion for the company when selecting a
  software product, but develop from the in margin no. 179 is not
  binding on the tax authorities.

### What happens if you are not compliant?

In the event of an infringement, you can expect a fine but also a court
order demanding the implementation of specific measures.

# Indonesia

## E-Faktur Module {#localization_indonesia/e-faktur}

The **E-Faktur Module** is installed by default with the Indonesian
localization module. It allows one to generate a CSV file for one tax
invoice or for a batch of tax invoices to upload to the **Tax Office
e-Faktur** application.

### NPWP/NIK settings {#localization_indonesia/npwp_nik}

- | **Your Company**
  | This information is used in the FAPR line in the effect file format.
    You need to set a VAT number on the related partner of your Odoo
    company. If you don\'t, it won\'t be possible to create an e-Faktur
    from an invoice.

- | **Your Clients**
  | You need to set the checkbox *ID PKP* to generate e-fakturs for a
    customer. You can use the VAT field on the customer\'s contact to
    set the NPWP needed to generate the e-Faktur file. If your customer
    does not have an NPWP, just enter the NIK in the same VAT field.

  ![image](indonesia/indonesia-partner-nik.png){.align-center}

### Usage {#localization_indonesia/e-faktur_usage}

#### Generate Tax Invoice Serial Number {#localization_indonesia/tax_invoice_sn}

1.  Go to `Accounting --> Customers --> e-Faktur`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}. In order to be able to export customer
    invoices as e-Faktur for the Indonesian government, you need to put
    here the ranges of numbers you were assigned by the government. When
    you validate an invoice, a number will be assigned based on these
    ranges. Afterwards, you can filter the invoices still to export in
    the invoices list and click on *Action*, then on *Download
    e-Faktur*.

2.  After receiving new serial numbers from the Indonesian Revenue
    Department, you can create a set of tax invoice serial numbers group
    through this list view. You only have to specify the Min and Max of
    each serial numbers\' group and Odoo will format the number
    automatically to a 13-digits number, as requested by the Indonesia
    Tax Revenue Department.

3.  There is a counter to inform you how many unused numbers are left in
    that group.

    ![image](indonesia/indonesia-sn-count.png){.align-center}

#### Generate e-faktur csv for a single invoice or a batch invoices {#localization_indonesia/csv}

1.  Create an invoice from
    `Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}. If the invoice customer\'s country is
    Indonesia and the customer is set as *ID PKP*, Odoo will allow you
    to create an e-Faktur.

2.  Set a Kode Transaksi for the e-Faktur. There are constraints related
    to the Kode transaksi and the type of VAT applied to invoice lines.

    ![image](indonesia/indonesia-kode-transaksi.png){.align-center}

3.  Odoo will automatically pick the next available serial number from
    the e-Faktur number table (see the
    `section above <localization_indonesia/tax_invoice_sn>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}) and generate the e-faktur number as a concatenation of
    Kode Transaksi and serial number. You can see this from the invoice
    form view under the page *Extra Info* in the box *Electronic Tax*.

    ![image](indonesia/indonesia-e-faktur-sn.png){.align-center}

4.  Once the invoice is posted, you can generate and download the
    e-Faktur from the *Action* menu item *Download e-faktur*. The
    checkbox *CSV created* will be set.

    ![image](indonesia/indonesia-csv-created.png){.align-center}

5.  You can select multiple invoices in list view and generate a batch
    e-Faktur .csv.

#### Kode Transaksi FP (Transaction Code) {#localization_indonesia/kode_transaksi_fp}

The following codes are available when generating an e-Faktur. - 01
Kepada Pihak yang Bukan Pemungut PPN (Customer Biasa) - 02 Kepada
Pemungut Bendaharawan (Dinas Kepemerintahan) - 03 Kepada Pemungut Selain
Bendaharawan (BUMN) - 04 DPP Nilai Lain (PPN 1%) - 06 Penyerahan Lainnya
(Turis Asing) - 07 Penyerahan yang PPN-nya Tidak Dipungut (Kawasan
Ekonomi Khusus/ Batam) - 08 Penyerahan yang PPN-nya Dibebaskan (Impor
Barang Tertentu) - 09 Penyerahan Aktiva (Pasal 16D UU PPN)

#### Correct an invoice that has been posted and downloaded: Replace Invoice feature {#localization_indonesia/replace_invoice}

1.  Cancel the original wrong invoice in Odoo. For instance, we will
    change the Kode Transakski from 01 to 03 for the INV/2020/0001.
2.  Create a new invoice and set the canceled invoice in the *Replace
    Invoice* field. In this field, we can only select invoices in
    *Cancel* state from the same customer.
3.  As you validate, Odoo will automatically use the same e-Faktur
    serial number as the canceled and replaced invoice replacing the
    third digit of the original serial number with *1* (as requested to
    upload a replacement invoice in the e-Faktur app).

![image](indonesia/indonesia-replace-invoice.png){.align-center}

#### Correct an invoice that has been posted but not downloaded yet: Reset e-Faktur {#localization_indonesia/reset_e-faktur}

1.  Reset the invoice to draft and cancel it.
2.  Click on the button *Reset e-Faktur* on the invoice form view.
3.  The serial number will be unassigned, and we will be able to reset
    the invoice to draft, edit it and re-assign a new serial number.

![Italian localization modules](italy/italy-modules.png){.align-center}

### Company information

Configuring the company\'s information ensures your Accounting database
is properly set up. To add information, go to
`Settings --> General Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and in the `Companies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, click
`Update info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. From here, fill out
the fields:

- `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the address of the
  company;
- `VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: VAT of the company;
- `Codice Fiscale`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the fiscal code
  of the company;
- `Tax System`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the tax system under
  which the company falls;

![Company information to provide](italy/italy-company.png){.align-center}

### E-invoicing

The `SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
the electronic invoicing system used in Italy. It enables to send and
receive electronic invoices to and from customers. The documents must be
in XML format and formally validated by the system before being
delivered.

To be able to receive invoices and notifications, the
`SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} service
must be notified that the user\'s files are to be sent to **Odoo** and
processed on their behalf. To so, you must set up Odoo\'s
`Codice Destinatario`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
**Agenzia Delle Entrate** portal.

1.  Go to <https://ivaservizi.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/> and
    authenticate;
2.  Go to section `Fatture e Corrispettivi`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"};
3.  Set the user as Legal Party for the VAT number you wish to configure
    the electronic address;
4.  In
    `Servizi Disponibili --> Fatturazione Elettronica --> Registrazione
    dell’indirizzo telematico dove ricevere tutte le fatture elettroniche`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}, insert Odoo\'s
    `Codice Destinatario`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    [K95IV18]{.title-ref}, and confirm.

#### Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)

Odoo uses the **FatturaPA**
`EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
format for the Italian localization and is enabled on the default
journals when installed. When the **file processing authorization** has
been set, all **invoices** and **bills** are automatically sent.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

You can
`enable electronic invoicing for other sales and purchase journals
<e-invoicing/configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} than the
default ones.
::::

You can check the current status of an invoice by the
`Electronic invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. The XML
file can be found in the **chatter** of the invoice.

![Electronic invoicing status (waiting for confirmation)](italy/italy-test.png){.align-center}

::: seealso
`../accounting/customer_invoices/electronic_invoicing`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

### File processing authorization (Odoo)

Since the files are transmitted through Odoo\'s server before being sent
to the `SdI (Sistema
di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or received by your
database, you need to authorize Odoo to process your files from your
database. To do so, go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings -->
Electronic Document Invoicing`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

There are **three** modes available:

`Demo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

:   This mode simulates an environment in which invoices are sent to the
    government. In this mode, invoices need to be *manually* downloaded
    as XML files and uploaded to the **Agenzia delle Entrate**\'s
    website.

`Test (experimental)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

:   This mode sends invoices to a non-production (i.e., test) service
    made available by the **Agenzia delle Entrate**. Saving this change
    directs all companies on the database to use this configuration.

`Official`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

:   This is a production mode that sends your invoices directly to the
    **Agenzia delle Entrate**.

Once a mode is selected, you need to accept the **terms and conditions**
by ticking `Allow
Odoo to process invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and then
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. You can now record your
transactions in Odoo Accounting.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Selecting either `Test (experimental)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Official`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
**irreversible**. Once in `Official`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
mode, it is not possible to select
`Test (experimental)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Demo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and same for
`Test (experimental)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. We recommend
creating a separate database for testing purposes only.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When in `Test (Experimental)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} mode,
all invoices sent *must* have a partner using one of the following fake
`Codice Destinatario`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} given by the
**Agenzia Delle Entrate**: [0803HR0]{.title-ref} -
[N8MIMM9]{.title-ref} - [X9XX79Z]{.title-ref}. Any real production
`Codice Destinario`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of your customers
will not be recognized as valid by the test service.
::::

![Italy\'s electronic document invoicing options](italy/italy-edi.png){.align-center}

## Taxes configuration

Many of the e-invoicing features are implemented using Odoo\'s tax
system. As such, it is very important that taxes are properly configured
in order to generate invoices correctly and handle other billing use
cases. For example, specific configurations are required for the
**reverse charge** type of taxes. In case of a **reverse charge** tax,
the seller does *not* charge the customer for the VAT but, instead, the
customer pays the VAT *themselves* to their government. There are
**two** main types:

- `external reverse charge <italy/external-reverse>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"};
- `internal reverse charge  <italy/internal-reverse>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

### External reverse charge {#italy/external-reverse}

#### Invoices

To make an export invoice, make sure that the invoice lines all use a
tax configured for **reverse charge**. The **Italian** localization
contains an **example** of a reverse charge tax for export in the EU to
be used as reference ([0% EU]{.title-ref}, invoice label
[00eu]{.title-ref}), which can be found under
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Exports are exempt from VAT, and therefore
**reverse charge** taxes require the
`Has exoneration of tax (Italy)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option ticked, with both the `Exoneration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} kind and `Law Reference`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} filled in.

![External reverse charge settings](italy/italy-tax.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If you need to use a different kind of `Exoneration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, click `Action -->
Duplicate`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} within the tax menu
to create a copy of an existing similar tax. Then, select another
`Exoneration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Repeat this process as many
times as you need different kind of `Exoneration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} taxes.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

**Rename** your taxes in the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field according to their `Exoneration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to differentiate them easily.
::::

On your invoice, select the corresponding tax you need in the
`Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. You can find the
following **additional info** by opening the **XML** file of the issued
invoice:

- `SdI address (Codice Destinatario)`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: must be filled for both **EU** or **non-EU**;
- `Country Id`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: must contain the
  country of the foreign seller in the two-letter ISO (Alpha-2) code
  (ex., [IT]{.title-ref} for \'Italy\');
- `CAP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: must be filled with
  [00000]{.title-ref};
- `Partita Iva`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (**VAT number**):
  must contain the **VAT** number for **EU businesses** and
  [OO99999999999]{.title-ref} (double \'O\' **letter**, not \'zero\')
  for **non-EU businesses**. In case of private customers without
  **VAT** number, use [0000000]{.title-ref};
- `Fiscal Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: for foreign entities
  without an actual **Codice Fiscale**, any recognizable identifier is
  valid.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Odoo does not support sending user-modified XML files.
::::

For **invoices**, multiple configurations are technically identified by
a `Tipo Documento`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} code:

- [TD02]{.title-ref} - Down payments;
- [TDO7]{.title-ref} - Simplified invoice;
- [TD08]{.title-ref} - Simplified credit note;
- [TD09]{.title-ref} - Simplified debit note;
- [TD24]{.title-ref} - Deferred invoice.

:::::::::: tabs
::: tab
[TD02]{.title-ref}

Down payments.

**Down payment** invoices are imported/exported with a different
`Tipo Documento`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} code
[TDO2]{.title-ref} than regular invoices. Upon import of the invoice, it
creates a regular vendor bill.

Odoo exports moves as [TD02]{.title-ref} if the following conditions are
met:

- Is an invoice;

\- All invoice lines are related to **sales order lines** that have the flag [is_downpayment]{.title-ref}

:   set as [True]{.title-ref}.
:::

::::: tab
[TD07]{.title-ref}, [TD08]{.title-ref}, and [TD09]{.title-ref}

Simplified invoices, and credit/debit notes.

Simplified invoices and credit notes can be used to certify **domestic
transactions** under **400 EUR** (VAT included). Its status is the same
as a regular invoice, but with fewer information requirements.

For a **simplified** invoice to be established, it must include:

- `Customer Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} reference:
  **unique** numbering sequence with **no gaps**;
- `Invoice Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: issue **date** of
  the invoice;
- `Company Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the **seller**\'s
  full credentials (VAT/TIN number, name, full address) under
  `General Settings --> Companies (section)`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"};
- `VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the **buyer**\'s VAT/TIN
  number (on their profile card);
- `Total`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total **amount** (VAT
  included) of the invoice.

In the `EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, Odoo exports invoices as simplified if:

- It is a **domestic** transaction (i.e., the partner is from Italy);
- The buyer\'s data is **insufficient** for a regular invoice;
- The **required fields** for a regular invoice (address, ZIP code,
  city, country) are provided;
- The total amount VAT included is **less** than **400 EUR**.

:::: note
::: title
Note

The 400 EUR threshold was defined in [the decree of the 10th of May 2019
in the Gazzetta
Ufficiale](https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2019/05/24/19A03271/sg).
We advise you to check the current official value.
::::

::::: tab
[TD24]{.title-ref}

Deferred invoices.

The **deferred invoice** is an invoice that is **issued at a later
time** than the sale of goods or the provision of services. A **deferred
invoice** has to be issued at the latest within the **15th day** of the
month following the delivery covered by the document.

It usually is a **summary invoice** containing a list of multiple sales
of goods or services, carried out in the month. The business is allowed
to **group** the sales into **one invoice**, generally issued at the
**end of the month** for accounting purposes. Deferred invoices are
default for **wholesaler** having recurrent clients.

If the goods are transported by a **carrier**, every delivery has an
associated **Documento di Transporto (DDT)**, or **Transport Document**.
The deferred invoice **must** indicate the details of all the **DDTs**
information for better tracing.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

E-invoicing of deferred invoices requires the
[l10n_it_stock_ddt]{.title-ref}
`module <italy/modules>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. In this case, a
dedicated `Tipo Documento`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
[TD24]{.title-ref} is used in the e-invoice.
::::

Odoo exports moves as [TD24]{.title-ref} if the following conditions are
met:

- Is an invoice;
- Is associated to deliveries whose **DDTs** have a **different** date
  than the issuance date of the invoice.
:::::

#### Vendor bills

Italian companies buying goods or services from EU countries (or
services from non-EU countries) must send the information contained
within the bill received to the **Agenzia delle Entrate**. This allows
you to complete tax-related information on your bill, and to send it.
The seller must be set as `Cedente/Prestatore`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and the buyer as
`Cessionario/Committente`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Contained
within the **XML** document for the vendor bill, the vendor\'s
credentials show as `Cedente/Prestatore`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and your company\'s credentials as
`Cessionario/Committente`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Self-billing invoices or VAT invoice integrations must be issued and
sent to the tax agency.
::::

When inputting taxes in a vendor bill, it is possible to select
**reverse charge** taxes. These are automatically activated in the
Italian fiscal position. By going to `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, the
[10%]{.title-ref} and [22%]{.title-ref} `Goods`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Services`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tax
scopes are activated and preconfigured with the correct tax grids. These
are set up automatically to ensure the correct booking of accounting
entries and display of the tax report.

For **vendor bills**, **three** types of configurations are technically
identified by a code called `Tipo Documento`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}:

- [TD17]{.title-ref} - Buying services from **EU** and **non-EU**
  countries;
- [TD18]{.title-ref} - Buying **goods** from **EU**;
- [TD19]{.title-ref} - Buying **goods** from a **foreign** vendor, but
  the **goods** are already in **Italy** in a **VAT deposit**.

:::::: tabs
::: tab
[TD17]{.title-ref}

Buying **services** from **EU** and **non-EU** countries:

The foreign *seller* invoices a service with a **VAT-excluded** price,
as it is not taxable in Italy. The VAT is paid by the *buyer* in Italy;

- Within EU: the *buyer* integrates the invoice received with the **VAT
  information** due in Italy (i.e., **vendor bill tax integration**);
- Non-EU: the *buyer* sends themselves an invoice (i.e.,
  **self-billing**).

Odoo exports a transaction as [TD17]{.title-ref} if the following
conditions are met:

- Is a vendor bill;
- At least one tax on the invoice lines targets the tax grids
  `VJ <italy/grids>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"};
- All invoice lines either have `Services`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} as **products**, or a tax with the
  `Services`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as **tax scope**.
:::

::: tab
[TD18]{.title-ref}

Buying **goods** from **EU**:

Invoices issued within the EU follow a **standard format**, therefore
only an integration of the existing invoice is required.

Odoo exports a transaction as [TD18]{.title-ref} if the following
conditions are met:

- Is a vendor bill;
- At least one tax on the invoice lines targets the tax grids
  `VJ <italy/grids>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"};

  information** due in Italy (i.e., **vendor bill tax integration**);
- Non-EU: the *buyer* sends an invoice to *themselves* (i.e.,
  **self-billing**).

Odoo exports a move as a [TD19]{.title-ref} if the following conditions
are met:

- Is a vendor bill;

San Marino and Italy have special agreements on e-invoicing operations.
As such, **invoices** follow the regular **reverse charge** rules.
Additional requirements are not enforced by Odoo, however, the user is
requested by the **State** to:

- Select a tax with the option
  `Has exoneration of tax (Italy)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  ticked, and the `Exoneration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set
  to [N3.3]{.title-ref};
- Use the generic `SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} `Codice Destinatario`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  [2R4GTO8]{.title-ref}. The invoice is then routed by a dedicated
  office in San Marino to the correct business.

### Bills

When a **paper bill** is received from San Marino, any Italian company
**must** submit that invoice to the **Agenzia delle Entrate** by
indicating the e-invoice\'s `Tipo Documento`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field with the special value [TD28]{.title-ref}.

:::: tabs
::: tab
[TD28]{.title-ref}

Odoo exports a move as [TD28]{.title-ref} if the following conditions
are met:

- Is a vendor bill;
- At least one tax on the invoice lines targets the tax grids
  `VJ <italy/grids>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"};
- The **country** of the partner is **San Marino**.
:::
::::

## Pubblica amministrazione (B2G)

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Odoo does **not** send invoices directly to the government as they need
to be signed. If we see that the codice destinatario is 6 digits, then
it is not sent to the PA automatically, but you can download the XML,
sign it with an external program and send it through the portal.
::::

### Digital qualified signature

For invoices and bills intended to the **Pubblica Amministrazione
(B2G)**, a **Digital Qualified Signature** is required for all files
sent through the `SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. The **XML** file must be certified using a certificate
that is either:

- a **smart card**;
- a **USB token**;
- a **Hardware Security Module (HSM)**.

### CIG, CUP, DatiOrdineAcquisto

To ensure the effective traceability of payments by public
administrations, electronic invoices issued to the public
administrations must contain:

- The `CIG (Codice Identificativo Gara)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
  except in cases of exclusion from traceability obligations provided by
  law n. 136 of August 13, 2010;
- The `CUP (Codice Unico di Progetto)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"},
  in case of invoices related to public works.

If the **XML** file requires it, the **Agenzia Delle Entrate** can
*only* proceed payments of electronic invoices when the **XML** file
contains a `CIG (Codice Identificativo Gara)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} and `CUP (Codice Unico di Progetto)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. For each electronic invoice, it is **necessary** to
indicate the `CUU (Codice Univoco Ufficio)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, which represents the unique identifier code that allows
the `SdI (Sistema di Interscambio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} to
correctly deliver the electronic invoice to the recipient office.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- The `Codice Unico di Progetto)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
the `CIG (Codice Identificativo Gara)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
must be included in one of the **2.1.2** (DatiOrdineAcquisto), **2.1.3**
(Dati Contratto), **2.1.4** (DatiConvenzione), **2.1.5** (Date
Ricezione), or **2.1.6** (Dati Fatture Collegate) information blocks.
These correspond to the elements named `CodiceCUP`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `CodiceCIG`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of
the electronic invoice **XML** file, whose table can be found on the
government [website](http://www.fatturapa.gov.it/). - The
`CUU (Codice Univoco Ufficio)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} must be
included in the electronic invoice corresponding to the element
**1.1.4** (`CodiceDestinario`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).
::::

## Ri.Ba. (Ricevuta Bancaria)

`Ri.Ba. (Ricevuta Bancaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is a payment
method widely used in Italy where vendors request payments through their
bank, which forwards the request to the customer\'s own bank and takes
responsibility for the collection. This enables payment automation and
reduces risks for the vendor.

The vendor generally uploads a fixed-format text file with the list of
payments to the bank\'s web portal.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Ri.Ba. are exclusively for **domestic payments** in Italy. For
recurring international payments, please use [SEPA Direct Debt
(SDD)](../accounting/payments/batch_sdd)
::::

### Configuration

1.  Check that the [l10n_it_riba]{.title-ref} module is
    `installed <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

2.  Go to
    `Settings --> Users & Companies --> Companies`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and select the company that will use Ri.Ba.

3.  Fill out the required `SIA Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

    ![The company\'s SIA code](italy/sia-code.png)

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    The `SIA Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} identifies
    businesses within the Italian banking network and is used to receive
    money through specific payment methods. It consists of one letter
    and four digits (e.g., T1234) and can usually be found on the
    bank\'s portal or obtained by contacting the bank.
    ::::

4.  Ensure the Company\'s bank account has an Italian IBAN.

    ::: seealso
    How to configure
    `Bank Accounts <../accounting/bank>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}

### Accept Ri.Ba. for your invoices

Payments of type `Ri.Ba. (Ricevuta Bancaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} can be registered from the `Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}
(`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}).

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Make sure that your invoice involves a Partner that has a bank account
with an Italian IBAN.
::::

Then, all Payments must be grouped in a **Batch Payment**.

::: seealso
\- `Batch Payments <../accounting/payments>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} -
`Create a Batch Payment <../accounting/payments/batch>`{.interpreted-text

:::

Once you press the `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
for the Batch Payment, the `Ri.Ba. (Ricevuta
Bancaria)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} file is generated and attached
to the Batch Payment, so you can download it and upload it through your
bank\'s web portal.

# Kenya

## Configuration {#localization/kenya/configuration}

`Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the following
modules to get all the features of the Kenyan localization:

  Name                                                               Technical name                  Description

  `Kenyan - Accounting Reports`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}   [l10n_ke_reports]{.title-ref}   Installing this module grants you access to improved accounting reports for Kenya, such as Profit and Loss and Balance Sheets.

You also have to install the **Kenya Tremol Device EDI Integration**
package to be able to report your taxes to the **Kenya Revenue Authority
(KRA)** using the Tremol G03 Control Unit:

  Name                                                                       Technical name                     Description
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `Kenya Tremol Device EDI Integration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}   [l10n_ke_edi_tremol]{.title-ref}   Installing this module integrates with the Kenyan G03 Tremol control unit device to report taxes to KRA through TIMS.

![The three modules for the Kenya Fiscal Localization Package on Odoo](kenya/modules.png){.align-center}

## Kenyan TIMS integration

The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has decided to go digital for tax
collection through the **Tax Invoice Management System (TIMS)**. As of
December 1st, 2022, all VAT-registered persons should comply with TIMS.
The goal is to reduce VAT fraud, increase tax revenue, and increase VAT
compliance through standardization, validation, and transmission of
invoices to KRA on a real-time or near real-time basis.

All VAT-registered taxpayers should use a **compliant tax register**.
Odoo decided to develop the integration of the **Tremol G03 Control Unit
(type C)**, which can be run locally through USB. This device validates
invoices to ensure financial documents meet the new regulations and send
the validated tax invoices directly to KRA. Installing a proxy server
that provides a gateway between users and the internet is required.

### Installing the proxy server on a Windows device

Go to [odoo.com/download](https://www.odoo.com/page/download), fill out
the required information and click `Download`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

![Install the Proxy Server on a Windows device](kenya/download.png){.align-center}

Once it is loaded on your computer, a wizard opens. You have to read and
agree with the terms of the agreement. On the next page, select the
`type of install: Odoo IoT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then,
click `Next`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Install`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Once completed, click
`Next`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Check the
`Start Odoo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box to be redirected to
Odoo automatically, and then click `Finish`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

A new page opens, confirming your
`IoT Box <../../general/iot/config/connect>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is up and running. Connect your physical device **Tremol G03
Control Unit (type C)** to your laptop via USB. In the
`IoT Device`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, check that your
Tremol G03 Control Unit (type C) appears, confirming the connection
between the device and your computer.

![Your IoT box is up and running](kenya/iot-box.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If the device is not detected, try to plug it in again or click on the
`Restart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the top right
corner.
::::

::: seealso
`Connect an IoT box to your database <../../general/iot/config/connect>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

### Sending the data to KRA using the Tremol G03 Control Unit

As a pre-requisite, check out that the `Kenyan Accounting modules
<localization/kenya/configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are
installed on your database. Then, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Kenya TIMS Integration section`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and check that the
`control Unit Proxy Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} matches
the address of the IoT box.

To send data to KRA, create a new invoice by going to
`Accounting Dashboard -->
Customer Invoice card`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
clicking `New Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Upon
confirmation of a new invoice, the
`Send invoice to Fiscal Device`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button appears. Clicking on it sends the invoice details to the device
and from the device to the government. The
`CU Invoice Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is now
completed in your invoice, confirming the information has been sent.

The `Tremol G03 Fiscal Device`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
contains fields that are automatically completed once the invoice is
sent to the government:

- `CU QR Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Url from the KRA
  portal which reflects a QR code.
- `CU Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: reflects the
  serial number of the device.
- `CU Signing Date and Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The
  date and time when the invoice has been sent to KRA.

If you click on `Send and Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
.pdf of the invoice is generated. The
`Kenyan Fiscal Device Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
mentioned on the document.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To verify KRA has received the invoice information, take the
`CU Invoice Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and enter it in
the `Invoice Number Checker`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section
on [Kenya Revenue Authority website](https://itax.kra.go.ke/KRA-Portal).
Click `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and find the invoice
details.

# Mexico

## Webinars

A video on the Mexican localization is also available. This video covers
how to implement this localization from scratch, including how to set up
the configurations, how to complete common workflows, and provides an
in-depth look at several specific use cases, as well.

- [Video webinar of a complete
  demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cdogjm0GCI).

## Introduction

The Odoo Mexican localization modules allow for the signing of
electronic invoices, according to the specifications of the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} for [version 4.0 of the
CFDI](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/documentos/Anexo_20_Guia_de_llenado_CFDI.pdf),
a legal requirement, as of January 1, 2022. These modules also add
relevant accounting reports (such as: the
`DIOT (Declaración Informativa de Operaciones con Terceros)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, enables foreign trade, and the creation of delivery
guides).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In order to electronically sign any documents in Odoo, ensure the *Sign*
application is installed.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Configure your company

After installing the correct modules, the next step is to verify that
your company is configured with the correct data. To do so, go to
`Settings --> General Settings --> Companies`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select `Update Info`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} under your company name.

Enter the full `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
resulting form, including: `ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
code, `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} (`VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} number).

According to the requirements of the CFDI 4.0, the name of the main
company contact **must** coincide with your business name registered in
the `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, without the legal entity abbreviation.

![Main company contact requirements for a correct invoicing.](mexico/mx-company-info.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

From a legal point of view, a Mexican company **must** use the local
currency (MXN). Therefore, Odoo does not provide features to manage an
alternative configuration. If you want to manage another currency, let
MXN be the default currency and use a `pricelist
<../../sales/sales/products_prices/prices/pricing>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, instead.
::::

Next, go to
`Settings --> Accounting --> Electronic Invoicing (MX) --> Fiscal
Regime`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, then select the regime
that applies to your company from the drop-down list, and click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Fiscal regime configuration in the Accounting settings.](mexico/mx-fiscal-regime.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If you want to test the Mexican localization, the company can be
configured with a real address within Mexico (including all fields), and
add [EKU9003173C9]{.title-ref} as the `VAT`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and [ESCUELA KEMPER URGATE]{.title-ref} as the
`Company Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. For the
`Fiscal Regime`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, use
`General de Ley Personas Morales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

### Contacts

To create a contact that can be invoiced, go to
`Contacts --> Create`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Then,
enter the contact name, full `Address`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} including: `ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
code, `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} (`VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} number).

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

As with your own company, all of your contacts needs to have their
correct business name registered in the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. This also applies to the `Fiscal Regime`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, which needs to be added in the
`MX EDI`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
::::

### Taxes

Some additional configurations for factor type and tax objects need to
be added to the sales taxes in order to properly sign invoices.

#### Factor type

The *Factor Type* field is pre-loaded in the default taxes. If new taxes
are created, you need to make sure to configure this field. To do so, go
to `Accounting --> Configuration -->
Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, then enable the
`Factor Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field in the
`Advanced Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab for all
records, with the `Tax Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set as
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Factor Type Sales tax type configuration.](mexico/mx-factor-type.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Mexico manages two different kinds of 0% VAT to accommodate two
scenarios:

- *0% VAT* set the `Factor Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
  `Tasa`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- *VAT Exempt* set the `Factor Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  as `Exento`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
::::

#### Tax object

One requirement of the CFDI 4.0 is that the resulting XML file needs (or
does not need) to break down the taxes of the operation. There are three
different possible values that are added in the XML file:

- \`01\`: Not subject to tax - this value is added automatically if your
  invoice line doesn\'t contain any taxes.
- \`02\`: Subject to tax - this is the default configuration of any
  invoice line that contains taxes.
- \`03\`: Subject to tax and not forced to break down - this value can
  be triggered on-demand for certain customers to replace the value 02.

To use the [03]{.title-ref} value, navigate to
`Contacts --> your customer's invoice --> MX EDI
tab`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and activate the
`No Tax Breakdown`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox.

![No Tax Breakdown option on the MX EDI tab of the customer\'s invoice.](mexico/mx-tax-breakdown.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `No Tax Breakdown`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} value applies
**only** to specific fiscal regimes and/or taxes. Consult your
accountant first to see if it is needed for your business before making
any modification.
::::

#### Other tax configurations

When registering a payment, Odoo will carry out the movement of taxes
from the *Cash Basis Transition Account* to the account set in the
`Definition`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. For such movement,
a tax base account will be used: ([Base Imponible de Impuestos en Base a
Flujo de Efectivo]{.title-ref}) in the journal entry when reclassifying
taxes. **Do not delete this account**.

If you create a new tax in
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, you need to add the correct
`Tax Grids`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for it
([IVA]{.title-ref}, [ISR]{.title-ref} or [IEPS]{.title-ref}). Odoo
**only** supports these three groups of taxes.

![Tax accounts available for Odoo.](mexico/mx-taxes-config.png){.align-center}

### Products

To configure products, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then select a product to configure, or
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} a new one. In the
`Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and in the
`UNSPSC Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
select the category that represents the product. The process can be done
manually, or through
`a bulk import <../../essentials/export_import_data>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

All products need to have an
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} code associated with them in order to prevent validation
errors.
::::

### Electronic invoicing

#### PAC credentials

After you have processed your [Private Key
(CSD)](https://www.sat.gob.mx/aplicacion/16660/genera-y-descarga-tus-archivos-a-traves-de-la-aplicacion-certifica)
with the `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, you **must** register directly with the
`PAC <mx-requirements>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} of your choice
before you start creating invoices from Odoo.

Once you\'ve created your account with any of these providers, go to
`Settings -->
Accounting --> Electronic Invoicing (MX)`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Under the `MX PAC`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, enter the name of your
`PAC (Proveedor Autorizado de Certificación / Authorized Certification
Provider)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} with your credentials
(`PAC username`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`PAC password`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

![Configuring PAC credentials from the Accounting settings.](mexico/mx-pac-account.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If you do not have credentials, but want to test the electronic
invoicing, you can activate the
`MX PAC test environment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox,
and select `Solucion Factible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as the
`PAC (Proveedor Autorizado de Certificación / Authorized Certification
Provider)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. You do not need to add a
username or password for a test environment.
::::

#### .cer and .key certificates

The [digital certificates of the
company](https://www.gob.mx/tramites/ficha/certificado-de-sello-digital/SAT139)
must be uploaded within the `MX Certificates`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section. To do so, navigate to `Settings -->
Accounting --> Electronic Invoicing (MX)`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Under the `MX Certificates`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, select `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and a window will open. Click
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and from there, upload your
digital `Certificate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
(`.cer`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file), your
`Certificate Key`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
(`.key`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file), and your
`Certificate Password`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To finish,
click on `Save
& Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Tip
:::

If you still do not have one of the contracted
`PAC (Proveedor Autorizado de Certificación / Authorized Certification
Provider)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}s and you want to test
electronic invoicing, you can use the following
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} test certificates:

- `Certificate <mexico/certificate.cer>`{.interpreted-text
  role="download"}
- `Certificate Key <mexico/certificate.key>`{.interpreted-text
  role="download"}
- **Password**: `12345678a`

## Workflows

### Electronic invoicing

The invoicing process in Odoo is based on [Annex
20](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/anexo_20.htm)
version 4.0 of electronic invoicing of the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

#### Customer invoices

To start invoicing from Odoo, a customer invoice must be created using
the `standard invoicing
flow <../accounting/customer_invoices>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

While the document is in draft mode, changes can be made to it (the
correct `Payment Way`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Usage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that the customer might
require can be added, for example.)

After you `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the customer
invoice, a blue message appears stating: `The
invoice will be processed asynchronously by the following E-invoicing service: CFDI (4.0)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Pressing the `Process Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
sends the document to the government so it can be signed. After
receiving the signed document back from the government, the
`Fiscal Folio`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears on the
document, and the XML file is attached in the chatter.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If you click `Retry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`SAT status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the invoice,
you can confirm if the XML file is valid in the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

If you are in a testing environment, you will always receive the message
`Not Found`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

To send the signed invoice to your client by mail, you can send both the
XML and PDF files together, directly from Odoo, by clicking the
`Send & Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. You can also
download the PDF file to your computer, by clicking the
`Print`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and selecting the
desired print option.

#### Credit notes

While an invoice is a document type \"I\" (Ingreso), a credit note is a
document type \"E\" (Egreso).

The only addition to the `standard flow for credit notes
<../accounting/customer_invoices/credit_notes>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is that, as a requirement of the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, there has to be a relation between a credit note and an
invoice through the fiscal folio.

Because of this requirement, the field `CFDI Origin`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} adds this relation with a [01\|]{.title-ref}, followed
by the fiscal folio of the original invoice.

![Example CFDI Origin number.](mexico/mx-creating-credit-note.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

For the `CFDI Origin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to be
automatically added, use the `Add Credit
Note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button from the invoice,
instead of creating it manually.
::::

#### Payment complements

##### Payment policy

One addition of the Mexican localization is the
`Payment Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. According to
the SAT documentation, there are two types of payments:

- [PUE]{.title-ref} (Pago en una Sola Exhibición/Payment in a Single
  Exhibition)

- [PPD]{.title-ref} (Pago en Parcialidades o Diferido/Payment in
  Installements or Deferred)

  > ::: seealso
  > `../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/product_management/inventory_valuation/integrating_landed_costs`{.interpreted-text
  > role="doc"}
  > :::

The difference lies in the *Due Date* or *Payment Terms* of the invoice.

To configure
`PUE (Pago en una Sola Exhibición/Payment in a Single Exhibition)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} invoices, navigate to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and either select an invoice
`Due Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} within the same month, or
choose a payment term that does not imply changing the due month
(immediate payment, 15 days, 21 days, all falling within the current
month).

![Example of an invoice with the PUE requirements.](mexico/mx-pue-payment.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Some `Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are already
installed by default, and can be managed from
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Payment Terms`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.
::::

To configure
`PPD (Pago en Parcialidades o Diferido/Payment in Installements or
Deferred)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} invoices, navigate to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select an invoice with a
`Due Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} after the first day of the
following month. This also applies if your
`Payment Term`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is due in the
following month.

![Example of an invoice with the PPD requirements.](mexico/mx-ppd-payment.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Because the
`PPD (Pago en Parcialidades o Diferido/Payment in Installements or
Deferred)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} policy implies that an invoice
is not going to get paid at the moment, the correct
`Payment Way`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the
`PPD (Pago en Parcialidades o Diferido/Payment in Installements or
Deferred)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} invoices is
`99 - Por Definir`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (To define).
::::

##### Payment flow

In both cases, the payment process in Odoo
`is the same <../accounting/customer_invoices>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, the main difference being payments related to
`PPD (Pago en Parcialidades o Diferido/Payment in Installements or
Deferred)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} invoices trigger the creation
of a document type \"P\" (Pago).

If a payment is related to a
`PUE (Pago en una Sola Exhibición/Payment in a Single Exhibition)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} invoice, it can be registered with the wizard, and be
associated with the corresponding invoice. To do so, navigate to
`Accounting --> Customers -->
Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and select an
invoice. Then, click the `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. The invoice status changes to
`In Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, since the payment is
effectively validated when it is bank reconciled.

::: seealso
`../accounting/bank/reconciliation`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

While this process is the same for PPD invoices, the addition of the
creating an `electronic
document <../accounting/customer_invoices/electronic_invoicing>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} means some additional requirements are needed to correctly
send the document to the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

From an invoice, you need to confirm the specific
`Payment Way`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} where you received the
payment. Because of this, the `Payment Way`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field **cannot** be set as [99 - Por Definir (To
Define)]{.title-ref}.

If you are going to add a bank account number in the
`Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of a customer\'s
contact card, it must have a valid account number.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The exact configurations are in the [Anexo 20 of the
SAT](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/anexo_20.htm).
Usually, the `Bank Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} needs to
be 10 or 18 digits for transfers, 16 for credit or debit cards.
::::

If a payment is related to a signed invoice with the
`Payment Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} [PPD]{.title-ref},
Odoo generates the corresponding payment complement automatically, once
you click `Process
Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![CFDI (4.0) E-invoicing service process payment now message.](mexico/mx-signed-complement.png){.align-center}

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

A payment in MXN **cannot** be used to pay multiple invoices in USD.
Instead, the payment should be separated into multiple payments, using
the `Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
corresponding invoices.
::::

#### Invoice cancellations

It is possible to cancel the EDI documents sent to the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. According to the [Reforma Fiscal
2022](https://www.sat.gob.mx/consultas/91447/nuevo-esquema-de-cancelacion),
since January 1st, 2022, there are two requirements for this:

- With all cancellation requests, you **must** specify a *cancellation
  reason*.
- After 24 hours have passed since the creation of the invoice, the
  client **must** be asked to accept the cancellation.

There are four different cancellation reasons. In Odoo, you can cancel
invoices with the reasons *01 Invoices sent with errors with a
relation*, and *02 Invoices sent with errors without a relation*.

The following sections break down the process of canceling invoices for
each cancellation reason in Odoo.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo has certain limitations to canceling invoices in the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}: The reasons 03 and 04 (*Operation did not take place* and
*Nominative transactions related to a global invoice*, respectively) are
not currently supported by Odoo. For this, you need to cancel the
invoice directly in the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, and press `Retry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
the `SAT Status field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

##### 01 - invoices sent with errors with a relation

This cancellation reason must be used when a new invoice needs to
substitute the original one, due to an error in any field.

Begin by navigating to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the old invoice. Copy the
`Fiscal Folio`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the old invoice.
Then, navigate to the new invoice, and in the
`CFDI Origin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, add the value
[04\|]{.title-ref} and paste the `Fiscal Folio`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of the old invoice after the value. Finally, sign the
new document.

Next, navigate back to the old invoice, and notice the
`Substituted By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is now
available. Click the `Request EDI Cancellation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the old invoice, and then click
`Process Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the blue section
that appears. The invoice status changes to `Canceled`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and a confirmation is logged in the chatter.

Now, the invoice should be canceled in the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} as well. You can confirm this was done correctly, by
pressing `Retry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} status field.

If the document was canceled more than 24 hours after its creation, you
may need to ask the client to accept the cancellation in their "Buzón
Tributario" directly from the [SAT
website](https://www.sat.gob.mx/home).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The [04\|]{.title-ref} is only a code that helps Odoo to perform this
process. It has no relation to the method 04 reason for cancellation.
::::

![Old invoice with CFDI Origin.](mexico/mx-01-invoice-cancellation-substitute.png){.align-center}

![Invoice with the Substituted By field referencing the CFDI Origin invoice.](mexico/mx-01-invoice-cancellation.png){.align-center}

##### 02 - invoices sent with errors without a relation

This cancellation reason has to be used when an invoice was sent with an
error in any field, and does not need to be replaced by another one.

For this case, navigate to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select the old invoice. From here, the only
requirement is to click the `Request EDI Cancellation`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, and then click the
`Process Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

Because the field `Substituted By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
does not appear when using this cancellation reason, the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} should automatically detect that the cancellation reason is
02.

##### Payment cancellations

It is also possible to cancel *Payment Complements*. For this, go to the
payment, via `Accounting --> Customers --> Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and select `Request EDI
Cancellation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. As with invoices, a
blue button will appear. Click `Process now`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and the document will be sent to the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. After a few seconds, you can click
`Retry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the current
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} status.

Finally, the payment status is moved to `Cancelled`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Just like invoices, when you create a new *Payment Complement*, you can
add the relation of the original document, by adding a
[04\|]{.title-ref} plus the fiscal folio in the
`CFDI Origin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
::::

#### Invoicing special use cases

##### CFDI to public

If the customer you are selling goods or services to does not require an
invoice, a *CFDI to Public* has to be created.

If you use the `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} name
[PUBLICO EN GENERAL]{.title-ref}, an error will be triggered. This is a
main change in the CFDI 4.0 that requires invoices with that specific
name to need additional fields, which Odoo does not currently support.
So, for a *CFDI to Public* to be created, you need to add any name to
your customer that is **not** [PUBLICO EN GENERAL]{.title-ref}. (For
example: [CLIENTE FINAL]{.title-ref}).

In addition to this, it is required that the `ZIP`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} code of your company is added, the generic
`RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is set as [XAXX010101000]{.title-ref}, and the
`Fiscal Regime`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of your customer must
be set as: [Sin obligaciones fiscales]{.title-ref}.

![CFDI to Public Customer field configuration.](mexico/mx-cfdi-to-public.png){.align-center}

##### Multicurrency

The main currency in Mexico is MXN. While this is mandatory for all
Mexican companies, it is possible to send and receive invoices (and
payments) in different currencies. To enable the use of
`multicurrency <../accounting/get_started/multi_currency>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, navigate to the
`Accounting --> Settings --> Currencies`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and set `Mexican Bank`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} as the `Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
the `Automatic Currency Rates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section. Then, set the `Interval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field to the frequency you wish to update the exchange rates.

This way, the XML file of the document will have the correct exchange
rate, and the total amount, in both the foreign currency and in MXN.

It is highly recommended to use `a bank account for each currency
<../accounting/bank/foreign_currency>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The only currencies that automatically update their exchange rate daily
are: USD, EUR, GBP, and JPY.
::::

![Multi-currency configuration in the Accounting settings.](mexico/mx-multicurrency-1.png){.align-center}

##### Down payments

There can be cases where you receive a payment in advance from a
customer that needs to be applied to an invoice later. In order to do
this in Odoo, it is required to properly link invoices to each other
with the `CFDI Origin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. To do
so, it is necessary to have the `Sales
<../../sales>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} app installed.

::: seealso
[The official documentation for registration of down payments in
Mexico](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/documentos/Caso_uso_Anticipo.pdf).
:::

First, navigate to the `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
app to create a product [Anticipo]{.title-ref} and configure it. The
`Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be
`Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and use the
`UNSPSC Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be: [84111506
Servicios de facturación]{.title-ref}.

Then, go to
`Sales --> Settings --> Invoicing --> Down Payments`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and add the *Anticipo* product as the default.

Create a sales order with the total amount, and create a down payment
(either using a percentage or fixed amount). Then, sign the document,
and `Register the Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

When the time comes for the customer to get the final invoice, create it
again from the same sales order. In the
`Create Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} wizard, select
`Regular Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and uncheck
`Deduct down payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then, copy the `Fiscal Folio`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from
the first invoice, and paste it into the `CDFI Origin`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of the second invoice, adding the prefix
[07\|]{.title-ref} before the value. Then, sign the document.

After this, create a credit note for the first invoice. Copy the
`Fiscal Folio`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the second
invoice, and paste it in the `CFDI Origin`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} of the credit note, adding the prefix
[07\|]{.title-ref}. Then, sign the document.

With this, all electronic documents are linked to each other. The final
step is to fully pay the new invoice. At the bottom of the new invoice,
you can find the credit note in the
`Outstanding credits`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} - add it as
payment. Finally, register the remaining amount with the
`Register Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} wizard.

### External trade

The external trade is a complement to a regular invoice that adds
certain values in both the XML and PDF, to invoices with a foreign
customer according to [SAT
regulations](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/complemento_comercio_exterior.htm),
such as:

- The specific address of the receiver and the sender
- The addition of a `Tariff Fraction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  that identifies the type of product
- The correct `Incoterm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  (International Commercial Terms), among others (*certificate of
  origin* and *special units of measure*).

This allows the correct identification of exporters and importers, in
addition to expanding the description of the merchandise sold.

Since January 1, 2018, external trade is a requirement for taxpayers,
who carry export operations of type A1. While the current CFDI is 4.0,
the external trade is currently on version 1.1

In order to use this feature, the modules
`l10n_mx_edi_extended`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`l10n_mx_edi_extended_40`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} have to be
installed.

:::: important
::: title

:::

Before installing, make sure your business needs to use this feature.
Consult your accountant first, if needed, before installing any modules.
::::

#### Configuration

##### Contacts

To configure your company contact for external trade, navigate to
`Accounting -->
Customers --> Customers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
select your `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. While the CFDI
4.0 requirements ask you to add a valid `ZIP`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} code in your contact, the external trade complement
adds the requirement that your `City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and the `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must also be valid.
All three fields must coincide with the [Official SAT
Catalog](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/catalogos_emision_cfdi_complemento_ce.htm),
or you will receive an error.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Add the `City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the company\'s *contact*,
not in the company itself. You can find your company\'s contact in
`Accounting --> Customers -->
Customers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
::::

The fields `Locality`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Colony Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are optional and can be
added in the company directly in
`Settings --> General Settings --> Companies`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. These two fields have to coincide with the data
in the `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

![Optional external trade company fields.](mexico/mx-external-trade-rescompany.png){.align-center}

To configure the contact data for a foreign receiving client, navigate
to `Accounting
--> Customers --> Customers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and select the foreign client\'s contact. The contact must have the
following fields completed to avoid errors:

1.  The entire company `Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
    including a valid `ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} code and
    the foreign `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
2.  The format of the foreign `VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    (tax identification number, for example: Colombia
    [123456789-1]{.title-ref})
3.  In the `MX EDI`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, you need to
    address if the customer receives goods for a period of time
    temporarily (`Temporary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) or
    permanently (`Definitive`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If the new contact was created by duplicating another existing contact
from Mexico, make sure to delete any carried over information from the
`Fiscal Regime`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. In addition,
do not enable the `No Tax Breakdown`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option. Selecting this option hides mandatory fields that are required
for external trade contact configuration.
::::

![Required external trade customer fields.](mexico/mx-external-trade-customer-contact.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In the resulting XML and PDF files, the `VAT`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is automatically replaced by the generic VAT for abroad
transactions: [XEXX010101000]{.title-ref}.
::::

##### Products

All products involved with external trade have four fields that are
required, two of them exclusive to external trade.

1.  The `Internal Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the
    product is in the `General Information`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} tab.
2.  The `Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the product must
    be more than [0]{.title-ref}.
3.  The
    [correct](https://www.ventanillaunica.gob.mx/vucem/Clasificador.html)
    `Tariff
    Fraction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the product in the
    `Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
4.  The `UMT Aduana`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} corresponds to
    the `Tariff Fraction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Required external trade product fields.](mexico/mx-external-trade-product.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- If the UoM code of the `Tariff Fraction`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is [01]{.title-ref}, the correct
`UMT Aduana`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is [kg]{.title-ref}. -
If the UoM code of the `Tariff Fraction`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is [06]{.title-ref}, the correct
`UMT Aduana`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is [Units]{.title-ref}.
::::

#### Invoicing flow

Before creating an invoice, it is important to take into account that
external trade invoices require to convert the amounts of your product
into USD. Therefore, `multicurrency
<../accounting/get_started/multi_currency>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} **must** be enabled and *USD* **must** be activated in the
`Currencies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. The correct
`Service`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to run is `Mexican
Bank`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then, with the correct exchange rate set up in
`Accounting --> Settings -->
Currency`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, the only fields left
are `Incoterm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the optional
`Certificate
Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Other Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![External trade Other Info tab of a product.](mexico/mx-external-trade-other-info.png){.align-center}

Finally, sign the invoice with the same process as a regular invoice,
and click the `Process Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

### Delivery guide

A [Carta
Porte](https://www.sat.gob.mx/consultas/68823/complemento-carta-porte-)
is a bill of lading: a document that states the type, quantity, and
destination of goods being carried.

On December 1st, 2021, version 2.0 of this CFDI was implemented for all
transportation providers, intermediaries, and owners of goods. Odoo is
able to generate a document type \"T\" (Traslado), which, unlike other
documents, is created in a delivery order instead of an invoice or
payment.

Odoo can create XML and PDF files with (or without) ground transport,
and can process materials that are treated as *Dangerous Hazards*.

In order to use this feature, the modules
`l10n_mx_edi_extended`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`l10n_mx_edi_extended_40`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`l10n_mx_edi_stock`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`l10n_mx_edi_stock_40`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} have to be
installed.

In addition to this, it is necessary to have the `Inventory
<../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
`Sales <../../sales/sales>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} apps
installed, as well.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo does not support Carta Porte type document type \"I\" (Ingreso),
air, or marine transport. Consult your accountant first if this feature
is needed before doing any modifications.
::::

#### Configuration

Odoo manages two different types of CFDI:

- **No Federal Highways**: Is used when the *Distance to Destination* is
  [less than 30
  KM](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/cartaporte/Paginas/documentos/PreguntasFrecuentes_Autotransporte.pdf).
- **Federal Transport**: Is used when the *Distance to Destination*
  exceeds 30 KM.

Other than the standard requirements of regular invoicing (The
`RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} of the customer, the UNSPSC code, etc.), if you are using
*No Federal Highways*, no external configuration is needed.

For *Federal Transport*, several configurations have to be added to
contacts, vehicle setups, and products. Those configurations are added
to the XML and PDF files.

##### Contacts and vehicles

Like the external trade feature, the `Address`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in both the company and the final customer must be
complete. The `ZIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} code,
`City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and `State`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} must coincide with the [Official SAT Catalog for Carta
Porte \<sat-catalog\_\>\_]{.title-ref}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The field, `Locality`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, is optional
for both addresses.
::::

![Delivery guide contact configuration.](mexico/mx-delivery-guide-contacts.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The origin address used for the delivery guide is set in `Inventory -->
Configuration --> Warehouses Management --> Warehouses`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. While this is set as the company address by
default, you can change it according to your correct warehouse address.
::::

Another addition to this feature is the
`Vehicle Setups`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu found in
`Inventory --> Settings --> Mexico`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. This menu lets you add all the information
related to the vehicle used for the delivery order.

All fields are mandatory to create a correct delivery guide.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The fields, `Vehicle Plate Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Number Plate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, must contain
between 5 to 7 characters.
::::

In the `Intermediaries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, you
must add the operator of the vehicle. The only mandatory fields for this
contact are the `VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Operator Licence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Delivery guide vehicle configuration.](mexico/mx-delivery-guide-vehicle.png){.align-center}

##### Products

Similar to regular invoicing, all products must have a
`UNSPSC category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In addition to
this, there are two extra configurations for products involved in
delivery guides:

- The `Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be set as
  `Storable Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for stock
  movements to be created.
- In the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, the field
  `Weight`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} should have more than
  [0]{.title-ref}.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Creating a delivery guide of a product with the value [0]{.title-ref}
will trigger an error. As the `Weight`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} has been already stored in the delivery order, it is
needed to return the products, and create the delivery order (and
delivery guide) again with the correct amounts.
::::

![Delivery guide product configuration.](mexico/mx-delivery-guide-products.png){.align-center}

#### Sales and inventory flow

To create a delivery guide, first, you need to create and confirm a
sales order from `Sales --> Sales Order`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. This generates a `Delivery`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button. Click it, and
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the transfer.

After the status is set to `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
you can edit the transfer, and select the
`Transport Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (either
`No Federal Highways`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Federal
Transport`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

If your delivery guide has the type
`No Federal Highways`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, you can save
the transfer, and then click `Generate Delivery Guide`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The resulting XML can be found in the chatter.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Other than the `UNSPSC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in all
products, delivery guides that use `No Federal
Highways`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} do not require any special
configuration to be sent to the government.
::::

If your delivery guide has the type,
`Federal Transport`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the tab
`MX EDI`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears. There, enter a
value in `Distance to Destination (KM)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} bigger than [0]{.title-ref}, and select the
`Vehicle Setup`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} used for this
delivery.

![Delivery guide MX EDI tab configuration.](mexico/mx-delivery-guide-federal-transport.png){.align-center}

##### Dangerous hazards

Certain values in the `UNSPSC Category`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} are considered in the [official SAT
catalog](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/complemento_carta_porte.htm)
as *dangerous hazards*. These categories need additional considerations
when creating a delivery guide with
`Federal Transport`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

First, select your product from
`Inventory --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, in the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, the fields
`Hazardous Material Designation Code (MX)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Hazardous Packaging (MX)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} must be filled with the correct code from the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} catalog.

![Delivery guide hazardous material product required fields.](mexico/mx-delivery-guide-hazards-designation.png){.align-center}

In
`Inventory --> Settings --> Mexico --> Vehicle Setup`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, the data from the
`Environment Insurer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Environment Insurance Policy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} has to
be filed, as well. After this, continue with the regular process to
create a delivery guide.

![Delivery Guide environment insurer required fields.](mexico/mx-delivery-guide-hazards-environment.png){.align-center}

### Customs numbers

A *customs declaration* (Pedimento Aduanero) is a fiscal document that
certifies that all contributions to the fiscal entity (the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}) has been paid for, including the import/export of goods.

According to the [Annex
20](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/anexo_20.htm) of
CFDI 4.0, in documents where the invoiced goods come from a first-hand
import operation, the field, `Customs Number`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, needs to be added to all lines of products involved
with the operation.

To do so, the module `l10n_mx_edi_landing`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} must be installed, in addition to the
`Inventory <../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, `Purchase
<../../inventory_and_mrp/purchase>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
`Sales <../../sales/sales>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} apps.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Do not confuse this feature with external trade. The customs numbers are
directly related to importing goods, while the external trade complement
is related to exporting. Consult your accountant first if this feature
is needed before doing any modifications.
::::

#### Configuration

In order to track the correct customs number for a specific invoice,
Odoo uses `landed costs
<../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/product_management/inventory_valuation/integrating_landed_costs>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. Go to
`Inventory --> Configuration --> Settings --> Valuation`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Make sure that `Landed Costs`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is activated.

Begin by creating a *service*-type product called,
[Pedimento]{.title-ref}. In the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, activate `Is a Landed Cost`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and select a `Default Split Method`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Then, configure the *storable products* that hold the customs numbers.
To do so, create the storable products, and make sure the
`Product Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} has the following
configuration.

- `Costing Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Either
  `FIFO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `AVCO`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `Automated`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Stock Valuation Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `115.01.01 Inventario`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Stock Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `Inventory Valuation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Stock Input Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `115.05.01 Mercancías en tránsito`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Stock Output Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  `115.05.01 Mercancías en tránsito`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

![Storable products general configuration.](mexico/mx-landing-configuration.png){.align-center}

![Storable product category configuration.](mexico/mx-landing-configuration-category.png){.align-center}

#### Purchase and sales flow

After you configure your product, follow the standard `purchase flow
<../../inventory_and_mrp/purchase>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

Create a purchase order from
`Purchase --> Orders --> Purchase Order`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, confirm the order to display a
`Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button. Click on the
`Receipt`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button to
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} the receipt.

Go to `Inventory --> Operations --> Landed Costs`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and create a new record. Add the transfer that
you just created, and both: the product [Pedimento]{.title-ref} and
`Customs number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Optionally, you can add a cost amount. After this, validate the landed
cost. Once `Posted`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, all products
related to that receipt have the customs number assigned.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

You can only add the *Pedimentos* number **once**, so be careful when
associating the correct number with the transfer(s).
::::

![Customs number on a landed costs Inventory record.](mexico/mx-landing-inventory.png){.align-center}

Now, create a sales order, and confirm it. This should trigger a
`Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button. Validate it.

Finally, create an invoice from the sales order, and confirm it. The
invoice line related to your product has a customs number in it. This
number should match the customs number added in the *Landed Costs*
record you created earlier.

![Customs number on confirmed sales order product.](mexico/mx-landing-invoice.png){.align-center}

### Electronic accounting

For Mexico, [Electronic
Accounting](https://www.sat.gob.mx/aplicacion/42150/envia-tu-contabilidad-electronica)
refers to the obligation to keep accounting records and entries through
electronic means, and to enter accounting information on a monthly
basis, through the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} website.

It consists of three main XML files:

1.  The updated list of the chart of accounts that you are currently
    using.
2.  A monthly trial balance, plus a closing entry report, also known as:
    *Trial Balance Month 13*.
3.  Either optional, or for a compulsory audit, an export of the journal
    entries in your general ledger.

The resulting XML files follow the requirements of the [Anexo Técnico de
Contabilidad Electrónica
1.3](https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/151135/Anexo24_05012015.pdf).

In addition to this, you can generate the
[DIOT](https://www.sat.gob.mx/declaracion/74295/presenta-tu-declaracion-informativa-de-operaciones-con-terceros-(diot)-):
A report of vendor\'s journal entries that involve IVA taxes that can be
exported in a `.txt`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file.

In order to use these reports, the modules
`l10n_mx_reports`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`l10n_mx_reports_closing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`l10n_mx_xml_polizas`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`l10n_mx_xml_polizas_edi`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} have to be
installed, as well as the `Accounting
<../accounting/get_started>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

You can find the *Chart of accounts*, *Trial Balance Month 13*, and
*DIOT* reports in
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Mexico`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The specific characteristics and obligations of the reports that you
send might change according to your fiscal regime. Always contact your
accountant before sending any documents to the government.
::::

#### Chart of accounts {#l10n_mx/chart-of-accounts}

The
`chart of accounts <../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} in México follows a specific pattern based on
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}\'s\' [Código agrupador de
cuentas](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/fichas_tematicas/buzon_tributario/Documents/codigo_agrupador.pdf).

You can create any account, as long as it respects
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}\'s encoding group: the pattern is [NNN.YY.ZZ]{.title-ref}
or [NNN.YY.ZZZ]{.title-ref}.

::: example
Some examples are [102.01.99]{.title-ref} or [401.01.001]{.title-ref}.
:::

When a new account is created in
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Chart of
Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, with the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} encoding group pattern, the correct grouping code appears
in `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and your account appears
in the *COA* report.

Once you create all your accounts, make sure the correct
`Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are added.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

You cannot use any pattern that ends a section with a 0 (such as
[100.01.01]{.title-ref}, [301.00.003]{.title-ref} or
[604.77.00]{.title-ref}). This triggers errors in the report.
::::

Once everything is set up, you can go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Mexico -->
COA`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click the
`SAT (XML)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to generate an XML
file containing all of your accounts, which will be ready to upload to
the `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} website.

#### Trial balance

The trial balance reports the initial balance, credit, and total balance
of your accounts, provided that you added their correct
`encoding group <l10n_mx/chart-of-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

This report can be generated monthly, and a corresponding XML file is
created, if you go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Mexico --> Trial Balance`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and click the `SAT (XML)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. Select the month you want to download
beforehand.

Odoo does not generate the *Balanza de Comprobación Complementaria*.
::::

An additional report is the *Month 13*: a closing balance sheet that
shows any adjustments or movements made in the accounting to close the
year.

To generate this XML document, navigate to
`Accounting --> Accounting -->
Miscellaneous --> Journal Entries`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and create a new document. Here, add all amounts
to modify, and balance the debit and/or credit of each one.

After this is done, click `Mark as Closing Entry`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and the report found in
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Mexico --> Trial Balance Month 13`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, contains the total amount of the year, plus all
the additions of the journal entry.

The XML file is generated by pressing the `SAT (XML)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

#### General ledger

By law, all transactions in Mexico must be recorded digitally. Since
Odoo automatically creates all the underlying journal entries of your
invoicing and payments, you can export your journal entries to comply
with `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}\'s audits and/or tax refunds.

:::: tip

To create the XML, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Audit Reports --> General
Ledger`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and click
`XML (Polizas)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Here, you can select
between four types of `Export`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} types:

- `Tax audit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Audit certification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Return of goods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Compensation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

For `Tax audit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Audit certification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, you need to
write the `Order Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} provided by
the `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. For `Return of goods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
or `Compensation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, you need to write
your `Process Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, also provided
by the `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text

#### DIOT report

The DIOT (Declaración Informativa de Operaciones con Terceros /
*Informative Declaration of Operations with Third Parties*) is an
additional obligation with the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, where the current status of creditable and non-creditable
payments, withholdings, and refunds of VAT from your vendor bills, are
provided to the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

Unlike other reports, the
`DIOT (Declaración Informativa de Operaciones con Terceros)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} is uploaded to a software provided by the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} that contains the A-29 form. In Odoo, you can download the
records of your transactions as a `.txt`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
file that can be uploaded to the form, avoiding direct capture of this
data.

The transactions file contains the total amount of your payments
registered in vendor bills, broken down into the corresponding types of
IVA. The `VAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is mandatory for all
vendors.

To get the
`DIOT (Declaración Informativa de Operaciones con Terceros)`{.interpreted-text

# Peru

## Introduction

The Peruvian localization has been improved and extended, in this
version the next modules are available:

- **l10n_pe**: Adds accounting features for the Peruvian localization,
  which represent the minimal configuration required for a company to
  operate in Peru and under the SUNAT regulations and guidelines. The
  main elements included in this module are: Chart of account, taxes,
  document types.
- **l10n_pe_edi**: includes all technical and functional requirements to
  generate and validate Electronic Invoice, based on the SUNAT
  specification to create and process valid electronic documents, for
  more technical detail you can access the [SUNAT EDI
  specifications](https://cpe.sunat.gob.pe/node/88/), that keeps track
  of new changes and updates. The features of this module are based on
  the resolutions published on the [SUNAT
  Legislation](https://www.sunat.gob.pe/legislacion/general/index.html/).

Peru](https://www.odoo.com/slides/smart-tutorial-localizacion-de-peru-133)
:::

## Configuration

### Install the Peruvian localization modules

Go to *Apps* and search for Peru, then click Install in the module Peru
EDI. This module has a dependency with *Peru - Accounting*. In case this
last one is not installed, Odoo installs it automatically within EDI.

![The \"Module\" filter is set on \"Peru\"](peru/peru-modules.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When you install a database from scratch selecting Peru as country, Odoo
automatically installs the base module: Peru - Accounting.
::::

#### Configure your company

In addition to the basic information in the Company, we need to set Peru
as the Country, this is essential for the Electronic Invoice to work
properly. The field **Address Type Code** represents the establishment
code assigned by the SUNAT when companies register their RUC (Unique
Contributor Registration):

![Company data for Peru including RUC and Address type code](peru/peru-company.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

In case the Address type code is unknown, you can set it as the default
value: 0000. Be aware that if an incorrect value is entered, the
Electronic invoice validation might have errors.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The NIF should be set following the RUC format.
::::

#### Chart of Account

The chart of accounts is installed by default as part of the set of data
included in the localization module, the accounts are mapped
automatically in:

- Taxes
- Default Account Payable.
- Default Account Receivable

The chart of accounts for Peru is based on the most updated version of
the `PCGE (Plan
Contable General Empresarial)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, which is
grouped in several categories and is compatible with NIIF accounting.

### Accounting Settings {#peru/accounting-settings}

Once the modules are installed and the basic information of your company
is set, you need to configure the elements required for Electronic
Invoice. For this, go to `Accounting
--> Settings --> Peruvian Localization`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

#### Basic Concepts

Here are some terms that are essential on the Peruvian localization:

- **EDI**: Electronic Data Interchange, which in this refers to the
  Electronic Invoice.
- **SUNAT**: is the organization that enforces customs and taxation in
  Peru.
- **OSE**: Electronic Service Operator, [OSE SUNAT\'s
  definition](https://cpe.sunat.gob.pe/aliados/ose#:~:text=El%20Operador%20de%20Servicios%20Electr%C3%B3nicos%20(OSE)%20es%20qui%C3%A9n%20se%20encarga,otro%20documento%20que%20se%20emita).
- **CDR**: Receipt certificate (Constancia de Recepción).
- **SOL Credentials**: Sunat Operaciones en Línea. User and password are
  provided by the SUNAT and grant access to Online Operations systems.

#### Signature Provider

As part of the requirements for Electronic Invoice in Peru, your company
needs to select a Signature Provider that will take care of the document
signing process and manage the SUNAT validation response. Odoo offers
three options:

1.  IAP (Odoo In-App Purchase)
2.  Digiflow
3.  SUNAT

Please refer to the sections below to check the details and
considerations for each option.

##### IAP (Odoo In-App Purchase)

This is the default and the suggested option, considering the digital
ceritificate is included as part of the service.

![IAP option as signature providers](peru/peru-IAP.png){.align-center}

###### What is the IAP?

This is a signature service offered directly by Odoo, the service takes
care of the next process:

1.  Provides the Electronic invoice Certificate, so you do not need to
    acquire one by yourself.
2.  Send the document to the OSE, in this case, Digiflow.
3.  Receive the OSE validation and CDR.

###### How does it work?

The service requires Credits in order to process your electronic
documents. Odoo provides 1000 credits for free in new databases. After
these credits are consumed, you need to buy a Credit Package.

  ---------------
  Credits   EUR
  --------- -----
  1000      22

  5000      110

  10,000    220

  20,000    440
  ---------------

The credits are consumed per each document that is sent to the OSE.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If you have a validation error and the document needs to be sent one
more time, one additional credit will be charged. Therefore, it is
paramount that you verify all information is correct before sending your
document to the OSE.
::::

###### What do you need to do?

- In Odoo, once your enterprise contract is activated and you start
  working in Production, you need to buy credits once the first 1000 are
  consumed.
- As Digiflow is the OSE used in the IAP, you need to affiliate it as
  the official OSE for your company on the SUNAT website. This is a
  simple process. For more information, please check [OSE Affiliation
  guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BkrMTZIiJyi5XI0lGMi3rbMzHddOL1pa/view?usp=sharing).
- Register Digiflow as the authorized PSE, please check [PSE Affiliation
  guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QZoqWvtQERpS0pqp6LcKmw7EBlm9EroU/view?usp=sharing).

##### Digiflow

This option can be used as an alternative, instead of using the IAP
services you can send your document validation directly to Digiflow. In
this case you need to consider:

- Buy your own digital Certificate: For more detail regarding the
  official vendor list, and the process to acquire it, please refer to
  [SUNAT Digital
  Ceritifcates](https://cpe.sunat.gob.pe/informacion_general/certificados_digitales/).
- Sign a service agreement directly with
  [Digiflow](https://www.digiflow.pe/).
- Provide your SOL credentials.

![Digiflow](peru/peru-Digiflow.png){.align-center}

##### SUNAT

In case your company wants to sign directly with the SUNAT, it is
possible to select this option in your configuration. In this case you
need to consider: - Get the SUNAT Certification process accepted.

- Buy your own digital Certificate: For more detail regarding the
  official vendor list, and the process to acquire it, please refer to
  [SUNAT Digital
  Ceritifcates](https://cpe.sunat.gob.pe/informacion_general/certificados_digitales/).
- Provide you SOL credentials.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

When using direct connection with the SUNAT, the SOL User must be set
with the Company RUT + User Id. Example: `20121888549JOHNSMITH`
::::

#### Testing environment

Odoo provides a testing environment that can be activated before your
company goes into production.

When using the testing environment and the IAP signature, you don't need
to buy testing credits for your transactions as all of them are
validated by default.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

By default the databases are set to work on production, make sure to
enable the testing mode if needed.
::::

#### Certificate

In case you don't use Odoo IAP, in order to generate the electronic
invoice signature, a digital certificate with the extension `.pfx` is
required. Proceed to this section and load your file and password.

![EDI Certificate wizard](peru/peru-Certificate.png){.align-center}

#### Multicurrency

The official currency exchange rate in Peru is provided by the Bank of
Peru. Odoo can connect directly to its services and get the currency
rate either automatically or manually.

![Bank of Peru is displayed in Multicurrency Service option](peru/peru-multicurrency.png){.align-center}

Please refer to the next section in our documentation for more
information about
`multicurrencies <../accounting/get_started/multi_currency>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

### Configure Master data {#peru/master_data}

#### Taxes

As part of the localization module the taxes are created automatically
with their related financial account and electronic invoice
configuration.

![List of default taxes](peru/peru-taxes.png){.align-center}

##### EDI Configuration

As part of the taxes configuration, there are three new fields required
for electronic invoice, the taxes created by default have this data
included, but in case you create new taxes make sure you fill in the
fields:

![Taxes EDI data for Peru](peru/peru-taxes-edi.png){.align-center}

#### Fiscal Positions

There are two main fiscal positions included by default when you install
the Peruvian localization.

**Extranjero - Exportación**: Set this fiscal position on customers for
Exportation transactions.

**Local Peru**: Set this fiscal position on local customers.

#### Document Types

In some Latin American countries, including Peru, some accounting
transactions like invoices and vendor bills are classified by document
types, defined by the government fiscal authorities, in this case by the
SUNAT.

Each document type can have a unique sequence per journal where it is
assigned. As part of the localization, the Document Type includes the
country on which the document is applicable;the data is created
automatically when the localization module is installed.

The information required for the document types is included by default
so the user does not need to fill anything on this view:

![Document Type list](peru/peru-document-type.png){.align-center}

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Currently the documents supported on customer invoices are: Invoice,
Boleta, Debit Note and Credit Note.
::::

#### Journals

When creating Sales Journals, the following information must be filled,
in addition to the standard fields on the Journals:

##### Use Documents

This field is used to define if the journal uses Document Types. It is
only applicable to Purchase and Sales journals, which are the ones that
can be related to the different set of document types available in Peru.
By default, all the sales journals created use documents.

##### Electronic Data Interchange

This section indicates which EDI workflow is used in the invoice, for
Peru we must select "Peru UBL 2.1".

![Journal EDI field](peru/peru-journal-edi.png){.align-center}

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

By default, the value Factur-X (FR) is always displayed, make sure you
can uncheck it manually.
::::

#### Partner

##### Identification Type and VAT

As part of the Peruvian localization, the identification types defined
by the SUNAT are now available on the Partner form, this information is
essential for most transactions either on the sender company and in the
customer, make sure you fill in this information in your records.

![Partner identification type](peru/peru-id-type.png){.align-center}

#### Product

Additional to the basic information in your products, for the Peruvian
localization, the UNSPC Code on the product is a required value to be
configured.

![UNSPC Code on products](peru/peru-unspc-code.png){.align-center}

## Usage and testing

### Customer invoice

#### EDI Elements

Once you have configured your master data, the invoices can be created
from your sales order or manually. Additional to the basic invoice
information described on `our page about the
invoicing process <../accounting/customer_invoices/overview>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, there are a couple of fields required as part of the Peru
EDI:

- **Document type**: The default value is "Factura Electronica" but you
  can manually change the document type if needed and select Boleta for
  example.

  ![Invoice document type field on invoices](peru/peru-invoice-document-type.png){.align-center}

- **Operation type**: This value is required for Electronic Invoice and
  indicates the transaction type, the default value is "Internal Sale"
  but another value can be selected manually when needed, for example
  Export of Goods.

  ![Invoice operation type field on invoices](peru/peru-operation-type.png){.align-center}

- **EDI Affectation Reason**: In the invoice lines, additional to the
  Tax there is a field "EDI Affectation Reason" that determines the tax
  scope based on the SUNAT list that is displayed. All the taxes loaded
  by default are associated with a default EDI affection reason, if
  needed you can manually select another one when creating the invoice.

  ![Tax affectation reason in invoice line](peru/peru-tax-affectation-reason.png){.align-center}

#### Invoice validation

Once you check all the information in your invoice is correct, you can
proceed to validate it. This action registers the account move and
triggers the Electronic invoice workflow to send it to the OSE and the
SUNAT. The following message is displayed at the top of the invoice:

![Sending of EDI Invoice in blue](peru/peru-posted-invoice.png){.align-center}

Asynchronous means that the document is not sent automatically after the
invoice has been posted.

##### Electronic Invoice Status

**To be Sent**: Indicates the document is ready to be sent to the OSE,
this can be done either automatically by Odoo with a *cron* that runs
every hour, or the user can send it immediately by clicking on the
button "Sent now".

![Send EDI manually](peru/peru-sent-manual.png){.align-center}

**Sent**: Indicates the document was sent to the OSE and was
successfully validated. As part of the validation a ZIP file is
downloaded and a message is logged in the chatter indicating the correct
Government validation.

![Message on chatter when the invoice is valid](peru/peru-invoice-sent.png){.align-center}

In case there is a validation error the Electronic Invoice status
remains in "To be sent" so the corrections can be made and the invoice
can be sent again.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

One credit is consumed each time that you send a document for
validation, in this sense if an error is detected on an invoice and you
send it one more time, two credits are consumed in total.
::::

#### Common Errors

There are multiple reasons behind a rejection from the OSE or the SUNAT,
when this happens Odoo sends a message at the top of the invoice
indicating the error details and in the most common cases a hint to fix
the issue.

If a validation error is received, you have two options:

- In case the error is related to master data on the partner, customer
  or taxes, you can simply apply the change on the record (example
  customer identification type) and once it is done click on the Retry
  button.

- If the error is related to some data recorded on the invoice directly
  (Operation type, missing data on the invoice lines), the correct
  solution is to reset the invoice to Draft, apply the changes, and then
  send the invoice again to the SUNAT for another validation.

  ![List of common errors on invoices](peru/peru-errors.png){.align-center}

For more detail please refert to [Common errors in
SUNAT](https://www.nubefact.com/codigos-error-sunat/).

#### Invoice PDF Report

After the invoice is accepted and validated by the SUNAT, the invoice
PDF report can be printed. The report includes a QR code, indicating the
invoice is a valid fiscal document.

![Invoice PDF report](peru/peru-PDF.png){.align-center}

#### IAP Credits

Odoo's Electronic IAP offers 1000 credits for free, after these credits
are consumed in your production database, your company must buy new
credits in order to process your transactions.

Once you run out of credits a red label is displayed at the top of the
invoice indicating that additional credits are required, you can easily
buy them by accessing the link provided in the message.

![Buying credits in the IAP](peru/peru-credits-IAP.png){.align-center}

In the IAP service includes packages with different pricing based on the
number of credits. The price list in the IAP is always displayed in EUR.

#### Special Use cases

##### Cancellation process

Some scenarios require an invoice cancellation, for example, when an
invoice was created by mistake. If the invoice was already sent and
validated by the SUNAT, the correct way to proceed is by clicking on the
button Request Cancellation:

![Request invoice cancellation button](peru/peru-cancellation.png){.align-center}

In order to cancel an invoice, please provide a cancellation Reason.

###### Electronic Invoice Status

**To Cancel**: Indicates the cancellation request is ready to be sent to
the OSE, this can be done either automatically by Odoo with a *cron*
that runs every hour, or the user can send it immediately by clicking on
the button "Send now". Once it is sent, a cancellation ticket is
created, as a result the next message and CDR File are logged in the
chatter:

![Cancellation CDR sent by the SUNAT](peru/peru-cancellation-cdr.png){.align-center}

**Cancelled**: Indicates the cancellation request was sent to the OSE
and was successfully validated. As part of the validation a ZIP file is
downloaded and a message is logged in the chatter indicating the correct
Government validation.

![nvoice after cancellation](peru/peru-cancelled.png){.align-center}

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

One credit is consumed on each cancellation request.
::::

##### Cancellation process

When creating exportation invoices, take into account the next
considerations:

- The Identification type on your customer must be Foreign ID.
- Operation type in your invoice must be an Exportation one.
- The taxes included in the invoice lines should be EXP taxes.

![Exportation invoices main data](peru/peru-exp-invoice.png){.align-center}

##### Advance Payments

1.  Create the advance payment Invoice and apply its related payment.
2.  Create the final invoice without considering the advance payment.
3.  Create a credit note for the Final invoice with the advance payment
    amount.
4.  Reconcile the Credit note with the final invoice.
5.  The remaining balance on the final invoice should be paid with a
    regular payment transaction.

##### Detraction Invoices

When creating invoices that is subject to Detractions, take into account
the next considerations:

1.  All the products included in the invoice must have these fields
    configured:

    ![Detraction fields on products](peru/peru-detraction.png){.align-center}

2.  Operation type in your invoice must be `1001`

    ![Detraction code on invoices.](peru/peru-detraction-invoice.png){.align-center}

### Credit Notes

When a correction or refund is needed over a validated invoice, a credit
note must be generated, for this just click on the button "Add Credit
Note", a part of the Peruvian localization you need to prove a Credit
Reason selecting one of the options in the list.

![Add Credit Note from invoice](peru/peru-credit-note.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

When creating your first credit Note, select the Credit Method: Partial
Refund, this allows you to define the credit note sequence.
::::

By default the Credit Note is set in the document type:

![Credit Note document type](peru/peru-credit-note-document.png){.align-center}

To finish the workflow please follow the instructions on
`our page about Credit Notes
<../accounting/customer_invoices/credit_notes>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The EDI workflow for the Credit notes works in the same way as the
invoices.
::::

### Debit Notes

As part of the Peruvian localization, besides creating credit notes from
an existing document you can also create debit Notes. For this just use
the button "Add Debit Note".

By default the Debit Note is set in the document type.

### Electronic delivery guide 2.0 {#peru/edg}

The *Guía de Remisión Electrónica* (GRE) is an electronic document
generated by the shipper to support the transportation or transfer of
goods from one place to another, such as a warehouse or establishment.
In Odoo, there are several configuration steps needed before you can
successfully use this feature.

The use of the *guía de remisión electrónica* electronic document is
mandatory and required by
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} for taxpayers who need to transfer their products, except
those under the *Single Simplified Regime* (régimen único simplificado
or RUS).

#### Delivery guide types

##### Sender

The *Sender* delivery guide type is issued when a sale is made, a
service is rendered (including processing), goods are assigned for use,
or goods are transferred between premises of the same company and
others.

This delivery guide is issued by the owner of the goods (i.e., the
sender) at the beginning of the shipment. The sender delivery guide is
supported in Odoo.

::: seealso
[SUNAT guía de remisión](https://www.gob.pe/7899-guia-de-remision)
:::

##### Carrier

The *Carrier* delivery guide type justifies the transportation service
the driver (or carrier) performs.

This delivery guide is issued by the carrier and must be issued to each
shipper when the shipment goes through public transport.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The carrier delivery guide is **not** supported in Odoo.
::::

::: seealso
[SUNAT guía de remisión
transportista](https://tefacturo.pe/blog/sunat/guia-de-remision-electronica/guia-de-remision-transportista/)
:::

#### Transportation types

##### Private

The *Private* transportation type option is used when the owner
transfers goods using their own vehicles. In this case, a sender\'s
delivery guide must be issued.

##### Public

The *Public* transportation type option is used when an external carrier
moves the goods. In this case, two delivery guides must be issued: the
sender\'s delivery guide and the carrier\'s delivery guide.

#### Direct submission to SUNAT

The creation of the
`GRE (Guía de Remisión Electrónica)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
delivery guide in Odoo **must** be sent directly to the
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, regardless of the electronic document provider: IAP,
Digiflow, or
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

#### Required information

Version 2.0 of the electronic delivery guide requires additional
information on the general configuration, vehicles, contacts, and
products. In the general configuration, it is necessary to add new
credentials that you can retrieve from the
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} portal.

#### Cancellations

**Both** the sender and the carrier can cancel the electronic waybill as
long as the following conditions are met:

- The shipment has not been initiated.
- If the shipment has been initiated, the receiver **must** be changed
  before reaching the final destination.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} no longer uses the term \"Anula\", but now uses the term
\"Dar de baja\" for cancellations.
::::

#### Testing

The
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} does not support a test environment. This means that any
delivery guides that were generated by mistake **will** be sent to the
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

If, by mistake, the waybill was created in this environment, it is
necessary to delete it from the
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} portal.

#### Configuration

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

\- Electronic sender\'s
`GRE (Guía de Remisión Electrónica)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
currently the only supported type of waybill in Odoo. - The delivery
guide is dependent on the Odoo *Inventory* app, the
`l10n_pe_edi`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`l10n_pe`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} modules. - A second user
**must** be added for the creation of electronic documents.
::::

After following the steps to configure the
`electronic invoicing <peru/accounting-settings>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and the `master data <peru/master_data>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
the `Peruvian - Electronic Delivery Note 2.0`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} module ([l10n_pe_edi_stock_20]{.title-ref}).

Next, you need to retrieve the *client ID* and *client secret* from
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. To do so, follow the [manual de servicios web plataforma
nueva
GRE](https://cpe.sunat.gob.pe/sites/default/files/inline-files/Manual_Servicios_GRE.pdf).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In the
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} portal, it is important to have the correct access rights
enabled, as they may differ from the user set for electronic invoicing.
::::

These credentials should be used to configure the delivery guide general
settings from
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Peruvian Electronic Invoicing`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![Example for the SUNAT Delivery Guide API section configuration.](peru/gre-fields-example.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It is required to follow the format [RUC + UsuarioSol]{.title-ref}
(e.g., [20557912879SOLUSER]{.title-ref}) for the
`Guide SOL User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, depending on
the user selected when generating the
`GRE (Guía de Remisión Electrónica)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} API
credentials in the
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} portal.
::::

##### Operator

The *operator* is the vehicle\'s driver in cases where the delivery
guide is through *private* transport.

To create a new operator, navigate to
`Contacts --> Create`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and fill
out the contact information.

First, select `Individual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as the
`Company Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, add the
`Operator License`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the contact form.

For the customer address, make sure the following fields are complete:

- `District`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (`DNI`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}/`RUC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"})
- `Tax ID Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

![Individual type operator configurations in the Contact form.](peru/operator-configuration.png)

##### Carrier

The *carrier* is used when the delivery guide is through *public*
transport.

To create a new carrier, navigate to
`Contacts --> Create`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and fill
out the contact information.

First, select `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as the
`Company Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, add the `MTC
Registration Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Authorization Issuing Entity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
the `Authorization
Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

For the company address, make sure the following fields are complete:

- `District`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (`DNI`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}/`RUC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"})
- `Tax ID Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

![Company type operator configurations in the Contact form.](peru/company-operator-configuration.png)

##### Vehicles

To configure the available vehicles, navigate to
`Inventory --> Configuration -->
Vehicles`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and fill in the
vehicle form with the information needed for the vehicle:

- `Vehicle Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `License Plate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Is M1 or L?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Special Authorization Issuing Entity`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}
- `Authorization Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Default Operator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

It is important to check the `Is M1 or L?`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox if the vehicle has fewer than four wheels or
fewer than eight seats.
::::

![Vehicle not selected as an M1 or L type with extra fields shown.](peru/vehicle-not-m1-or-l-pe.png)

##### Products

To configure the available products, navigate to
`Inventory --> Products`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
open the product to be configured.

Make sure that the applicable information in the product form is fully
configured. The `Partida Arancelaria`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
(Tariff Item) field needs to be completed.

#### Generating a GRE

Once the delivery from inventory is created during the sales workflow,
make sure you complete the
`GRE (Guía de Remisión Electrónica)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
fields on the top-right section of the transfer form for the fields:

- `Transport Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Reason for Transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Departure start date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

It is also required to complete the `Vehicle`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Operator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
fields under the `Guia de Remision PE`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.

The delivery transfer has to be marked as *Done* for the
`Generar Guia de Remision`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
appear on the left menu of the transfer form.

![Generar Guia de Remision button on a transfer form in the Done stage.](peru/generate-gre-transferview.png)

Once the transfer form is correctly validated by
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, the generated XML file becomes available in the chatter.
You can now print the delivery slip that shows the transfer details and
the QR code validated by
`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

![Transfer details and QR code on generated delivery slip.](peru/gre-delivery-slip.png)

#### Common errors

- [Diferente prefijo para productos (T001 en algunos, T002 en
  otros)]{.title-ref}

  At the moment, Odoo does not support the automation of prefixes for
  products. This can be done manually for each product output. This can
  also be done for non-storable products. However, keep in mind that
  there will be no traceability.

- [2325 - GrossWeightMeasure - El dato no cumple con el formato
  establecido \"Hace falta el campo\" \"Peso\"\" en el
  producto]{.title-ref}

  This error occurs when the weight on the product is set as
  [0.00]{.title-ref}. To fix this, you need to cancel the waybill and
  recreate it. Make sure that you fix the weight on the product before
  creating the new waybill, or it will result in the same error.

- [JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0) when
  creating a Delivery Guide]{.title-ref}

  This error is typically generated due to SOL user issues. Verify the
  user\'s connection with the
  `SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"}; the SOL user must be established with the company RUT +
  user ID. For example [2012188549JOHNSMITH]{.title-ref}.

- [El número de documento relacionado al traslado de mercancía no cumple
  con el formato establecido: error: documento relacionado]{.title-ref}

  The *Related Document Type* and *Related Document Number* fields only
  apply to invoices and receipts.

- [400 Client error: Bad Request for URL]{.title-ref}

  This error is not solvable from Odoo; it is advised you reach out to
  the
  `SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} and verify the user. It may be necessary to create a new
  user.

- [Invalid content was found starting with element
  \'cac:BuyerCustomerParty\']{.title-ref}

  This error occurs when the transfer reason is set as *other*. Please
  select another option. Following to the official documentation of the
  `SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"}\'s waybill guide, the transfer reasons *03 (sale with
  shipment to third party)* or *12 (others)* does not work in Odoo,
  since you should not have an empty or blank customer.

- [Duda cliente: consumo de créditos IAP al usar GRE 2.0]{.title-ref}

  For live clients using IAP, no credit is consumed (in theory) because
  it does not go through the OSE, i.e., these documents are directly
  sent to the
  `SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"}.

- [Errores con formato credenciales GRE 2.0 (traceback
  error)]{.title-ref}

  Odoo currently throws an error with a traceback instead of a message
  that the credentials are not correctly configured in the database. If
  this occurs on your database, please verify your credentials.

# Philippines

## Configuration

`Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
`🇵🇭 Philippines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fiscal localization package
<fiscal_localizations/packages>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to get
all the default accounting features of the Philippine localization, such
as a chart of accounts, taxes, and the BIR 2307 report. These provide a
base template to get started with using Philippine accounting.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- When creating a new database and selecting the
[Philippines]{.title-ref} as a country, the fiscal localization module
**Philippines - Accounting** is automatically installed. - If the module
is installed in an existing company, the **chart of accounts** and
**taxes** will *not* be replaced if there are already posted journal
entries. - The BIR 2307 report is installed, but the withholding taxes
may need to be manually created.
::::

### Chart of accounts and taxes

A minimum configuration default chart of accounts is installed, and the
following types of taxes are installed and linked to the relevant
account:

- VAT 12%
- VAT Exempt
- Withholding taxes

For the withholding taxes (`Configuration --> Taxes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}), there is an additional
`Philippines ATC`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field under the
`Philippines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

![Philippines ATC code field set on taxes.](philippines/philippines-atc-code.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Taxes\' ATC codes are used for the BIR 2307 report. If a tax is created
manually, its ATC code must be added.
::::

### Contacts

When a company or an individual (not belonging to a company) contact is
located in the Philippines, fill in the `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field with their [Taxpayer Identification Number
(TIN)]{.title-ref}.

For individuals not belonging to a company, identify them by using the
following additional fields:

- `First Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Middle Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
- `Last Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

![Individual type contact with First, Middle, and Last Name fields.](philippines/philippines-contact-individual.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

For both `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Individual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the TIN should follow
the [NNN-NNN-NNN-NNNNN]{.title-ref} format. The branch code should
follow the last digits of the TIN, or else it can be left as
[00000]{.title-ref}.
::::

## BIR 2307 report

**BIR 2307** report data, also known as [Certificate of Creditable Tax
Withheld at
Source](https://www.bir.gov.ph/index.php/bir-forms/certificates.html),
can be generated for purchase orders and vendor payments with the
applicable withholding taxes.

To generate a BIR 2307 report, select one or multiple vendor bills from
the list view, and click
`Action --> Download BIR 2307 XLS`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![Multiple vendor bills selected with action to \"Download BIR 2307 XLS\".](philippines/philippines-multi-bill.png)

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The same action can be performed on a vendor bill from the form view.
::::

A pop-up appears to review the selection, then click on
`Generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Pop up menu to generate BIR 2307 XLS file.](philippines/philippines-generate.png)

This generates the [Form_2307.xls]{.title-ref} file that lists all the
vendor bill lines with the applicable withholding tax.

The process above can also be used for a *single* vendor
`payment <../accounting/payments>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} if it
is linked to one or more
`vendor bills <../accounting/payments>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
with applied withholding taxes.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- If no withholding tax is applied, then the XLS file will not generate
records for those vendor bill lines. - When grouping payments for
multiple bills, Odoo splits the payments based on the contact. From a
payment, clicking `Action --> Download BIR 2307 XLS`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} generates a report that only includes vendor bills
related to that contact.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Odoo cannot generate the BIR 2307 PDF report or DAT files directly. The
generated `Form_2307.xls`{.interpreted-text role="file"} file can be
exported to an *external* tool to convert it to BIR DAT or PDF format.

# Romania

## Configuration

`Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the following
modules to get all the features of the Romanian localization.

  Name                                                         Technical name               Description
  ------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `Romania - Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}    [l10n_ro]{.title-ref}        Default `fiscal localization package <fiscal_localizations/packages>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
  `Romanian SAF-T Export`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}   [l10n_ro_saft]{.title-ref}   Module to generate the **D.406 declaration** in the SAF-T format.

![Modules for the Romanian localization](romania/romania-modules.png)

## D.406 declaration

Starting January 1, 2023, companies registered for tax purposes in
Romania must report their accounting data to the Romanian Tax Agency
monthly or quarterly in the D.406 declaration.

Odoo provides all you need to export the data of this declaration in the
SAF-T XML format, which you can validate and sign using the software
provided by the Romanian Tax Agency.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Currently, Odoo only supports the generation of the monthly/quarterly
D.406 declaration (containing journal entries, invoices, vendor bills,
and payments). The yearly declaration (including assets) and the
on-demand declaration (including inventory) are not yet supported.
::::

### Configuration

#### Company

- Under `Settings --> General Settings`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, in the **Companies** section, click
  `Update Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and fill in the
  company\'s `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Telephone Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- Provide your company\'s
  `CUI (Codul Unic de Inregistrare)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  number or `CIF (*Codul de
  identificare fiscală*)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} number (for
  foreign companies) in the `Company ID`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field, without the [RO]{.title-ref} prefix (e.g.,
  [18547290]{.title-ref}).
- If your company is **registered** for VAT in Romania, fill in the
  `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field number, including
  the [RO]{.title-ref} prefix (e.g., [RO18547290]{.title-ref}). If the
  company is **not** registered for VAT in Romania, you **must not**
  fill in the `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
- Open the **Contacts** app and search for your company. Open your
  company\'s profile, and in the `Accounting`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} tab, click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} and add your **bank account number** if not informed
  already. Make sure the profile is set as `Company`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} above the **name**.
  - You must have at least one **contact person** linked to your company
    in the **Contacts** app. If no **contact person** is linked, create
    a new one by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, set
    it as `Individual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select
    your company in the `Company name`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field.

#### Chart of accounts

To generate a file receivable by the Romanian Tax Agency, the chart of
accounts must not deviate from an official chart of accounts, such as:

- the chart of accounts for commercial companies
  (*PlanConturiBalSocCom*), which is installed by default when creating
  a company with the Romanian localization or;
- the chart of accounts for companies following
  [IFRS](https://www.ifrs.org/) (*PlanConturiIFRS*).

Under `Settings --> Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, in
the **Romanian localization** section, set the
`Tax Accounting Basis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to reflect the
accounting regulations and Chart of Accounts used by the company.

::: seealso
`../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

#### Customer and supplier

Fill in the `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Zip Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of each partner that
appears in your invoices, vendor bills, or payments through the
**Contacts** app.

For partners that are companies, you must fill in the VAT number
(including the country prefix) in the `Tax ID`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. If the partner is a company based in Romania,
you may instead fill in the CUI number (without the \'RO\' prefix) in
the `Company ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

#### Tax

You must indicate the `Romanian SAF-T Tax Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} (3-digit number) and `Romanian
SAF-T Tax Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (6-digit number) on
each of the taxes you use. This is already done for the taxes that exist
by default in Odoo. To do so, go to `Accounting --> Configuration -->
Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, select the tax you wish
to modify, click the `Advanced Options`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and fill in the **tax type** and **tax code**
fields.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The **tax type** and **tax code** are codes defined by the Romanian Tax
Agency for the **D.406 declaration**. These can be found in the Excel
spreadsheet published as guidance for completing the declaration, which
you can find on the [website of the Romanian Tax
Agency](https://www.anaf.ro/anaf/internet/ANAF/despre_anaf/strategii_anaf/proiecte_digitalizare/saf_t/).
::::

::: seealso
`../accounting/taxes`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

#### Product

For some types of goods transactions, the
`Intrastat Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (Cod NC) must be
configured on the product, as it is required by Romanian law:

- import / export transactions;
- acquisitions / supplies of food products subjected to reduced VAT
  rate;
- intra-community movements subjected to intrastat reporting;
- acquisitions / supplies subjected to local reversed VAT charge
  (depending on Cod NC); and
- transactions with excisable products for which excise duties are
  determined based on the Cod NC.

If the Intrastat Code is not specified on a non-service product, the
default code \'0\' will be used.

To configure the `Intrastat Codes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
go to `Accounting --> Customers --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select a product, and in the
`Accounting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, set a
`Commodity Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
`../accounting/reporting/intrastat`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

#### Vendor bill

You must check the `Is self-invoice (RO)?`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} checkbox in the `Other Info`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab for any vendor bill that is a self-invoice (i.e. a
vendor bill that you issued yourself in the absence of an invoice
document received from a supplier).

### Generating the declaration

#### Exporting your data

To export the XML for the D.406 declaration, go to
`Accounting --> Reports -->
General Ledger`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and click on
`SAF-T`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Click on the \'SAF-T\' button to export the D.406 XML declaration.](romania/romania-saft-button.png){.align-center}

You can then validate and sign the XML file using the Romanian Tax
Agency\'s validation software, *DUKIntegrator*.

#### Signing the report

Download and install the *DUKIntegrator* validation software found on
the [website of the Romanian Tax
Agency](https://www.anaf.ro/anaf/internet/ANAF/despre_anaf/strategii_anaf/proiecte_digitalizare/saf_t/).

Once you have generated the XML, open \'DUKIntegrator\' and select the
file you have just generated.

Click on `Validare + creare PDF`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
create an **unsigned** PDF containing your report, or
`Validare + creare PDF semnat`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
create a **signed** PDF containing your report.

![The DUKIntegrator validation software.](romania/romania-dukintegrator.png){.align-center}

If the *DUKIntegrator* validator detects errors or inconsistencies in
your data, it generates a file that explains the errors. In this case,
you need to correct those inconsistencies in your data before you can
submit the report to the Romanian Tax Agency.

\- Testing all invoicing workflows, preferably with real invoices and
for a reasonable amount of time, is recommended. - Compare the invoices
received statistics page on the Fatoora simulation portal with the list
of invoices on Odoo to ensure both align.
::::

#### Taxes

When using a **0% tax** in a customer invoice, it is necessary to
specify the reason behind such a rate. To configure taxes, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings -->
Taxes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and open the tax to
edit. Under the `Advanced Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
select an `Exemption Reason Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

When using **retention** or **withholding an amount** in a customer
invoice, the tax used to retain the amount needs to be specified.

### Production mode

When ready for production, change the
`API mode <saudi-arabia/api-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to
`Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Setting the `API mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Production`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is **irreversible**.
::::

The sales journals initially linked to the simulation portal now needs
to be linked to the regular portal. To do so,
`onboard the journals <saudi-arabia/journals>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} again, ensuring to use the regular [Fatoora
portal](https://fatoora.zatca.gov.sa/) this time.

# Spain

## Spanish chart of accounts

Several Spanish charts of accounts are available by default in Odoo:

- PGCE PYMEs 2008
- PGCE Completo 2008
- PGCE Entitades

To choose the one you want, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then select a package in the
`Fiscal localization`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

When you create a new Odoo Online database, the PGCE PYMEs 2008 is
installed by default.

You can only change the accounting package as long as you have not
created any accounting entry.

## Spanish accounting reports

If the Spanish accounting localization is installed, you have access to
accounting reports specific to Spain:

- Balance Sheet
- Tax Report (Modelo 111)
- Tax Report (Modelo 115)
- Tax Report (Modelo 303)
- Tax Report (Modelo 347)
- Tax Report (Modelo 349)

# Switzerland

## ISR (In-payment Slip with Reference number)

The ISRs are payment slips used in Switzerland. You can print them
directly from Odoo. On the customer invoices, there is a new button
called *Print ISR*.

![image](switzerland/switzerland00.png){.align-center}

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The button *Print ISR* only appears there is well a bank account defined
on the invoice. You can use CH6309000000250097798 as bank account number
and 010391391 as CHF ISR reference.
::::

![image](switzerland/switzerland01.png){.align-center}

Then you open a pdf with the ISR.

![image](switzerland/switzerland02.png){.align-center}

There exists two layouts for ISR: one with, and one without the bank
coordinates. To choose which one to use, there is an option to print the
bank information on the ISR. To activate it, go in
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Customer Invoices`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and enable **Print bank on ISR**:

![image](switzerland/switzerland03.png){.align-center}

### ISR reference on invoices

To ease the reconciliation process, you can add your ISR reference as
**Payment Reference** on your invoices.

To do so, you need to configure the Journal you usually use to issue
invoices. Go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, open the Journal you want to modify (By default,
the Journal is named *Customer Invoices*), click en *Edit*, and open the
*Advanced Settings* tab. In the **Communication Standard** field, select
*Switzerland*, and click on *Save*.

![Configure your Journal to display your ISR as payment reference on your invoices in Odoo](switzerland/switzerland-isr-reference.png){.align-center}

## Currency Rate Live Update

You can update automatically your currencies rates based on the Federal
Tax Administration from Switzerland. For this, go in
`Accounting --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
activate the multi-currencies setting and choose the service you want.

## Updated VAT for January 2018

Starting from the 1st January 2018, new reduced VAT rates will be
applied in Switzerland. The normal 8.0% rate will switch to 7.7% and the
specific rate for the hotel sector will switch from 3.8% to 3.7%.

### How to update your taxes in Odoo Enterprise (Odoo Online or On-premise)?

If you have the V11.1 version, all the work is already been done, you
don\'t have to do anything.

If you have started on an earlier version, you first have to update the
module \"Switzerland - Accounting Reports\". For this, you go in
`Apps --> remove the filter "Apps" --> search for "Switzerland - Accounting Reports" --> open the module --> click on "upgrade"`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![image](switzerland/switzerland05.png){.align-center}

Once it has been done, you can work on creating new taxes for the
updated rates.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

**Do not suppress or modify the existing taxes** (8.0% and 3.8%). You
want to keep them since you may have to use both rates for a short
period of time. Instead, remember to archive them once you have encoded
all your 2017 transactions.
::::

The creation of such taxes should be done in the following manner:

- **Purchase taxes**: copy the origin tax, change its name, label on
  invoice, rate and tax group (effective from v10 only)
- **Sale taxes**: copy the origin tax, change its name, label on
  invoice, rate and tax group (effective from v10 only). Since the vat
  report now shows the details for old and new rates, you should also
  set the tags accordingly to
  - For 7.7% taxes: Switzerland VAT Form: grid 302 base, Switzerland VAT
    Form: grid 302 tax
  - For 3.7% taxes: Switzerland VAT Form: grid 342 base, Switzerland VAT
    Form: grid 342 tax

You\'ll find below, as examples, the correct configuration for all taxes
included in Odoo by default

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Tax Name**    **Rate**   **Label on  **Tax Group  **Tax       **Tag**

# Thailand

## Configuration

`Install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the
`🇹🇭 Thailand`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} localization package to
get all the features of the Thai localization:

  Name                                                                 Technical name                  Description

  `Thailand - Accounting Reports`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}   [l10n_th_reports]{.title-ref}   Country-specific accounting reports

![Thailand localization modules](thailand/modules.png)

## Chart of accounts and taxes

Odoo\'s fiscal localization package for Thailand includes the following
taxes:

- VAT 7%
- VAT-exempted
- Withholding tax
- Withholding income tax

## Tax report

Odoo allows users to generate Excel files to submit their VAT to the
**Revenue Department** of Thailand.

### Sales and purchase tax report

To generate a sales and purchase tax report, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax
Report`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Select a specific time
or time range on the tax report, and click
`VAT-202-01 (xlsx)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for purchase tax
and `VAT-202-02 (xlsx)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for sales
tax.

![Thai purchase and sales taxes reports](thailand/tax-report.png)

### Withholding PND tax report

PND report data displays the summarized amounts of the applicable
**withholding corporate income tax returns (domestic)** from vendor
bills under the `PND53 (TH)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`PND3 (TH)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tax reports. It is
installed by default with the Thai localization.

![PND tax reports](thailand/pnd-report.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Withholding corporate income tax returns (domestic) is the tax used in
case the company has withheld the tax from "**Personal (PND3)**" or
"**Corporate (PND53)**" services provided such as rental, hiring,
transportation, insurance, management fee, consulting, etc.
::::

The PND tax report allows users to generate a CSV file for bills to
upload on the [RDprep for Thailand e-Filling
application](https://efiling.rd.go.th/rd-cms/).

To generate a PND CSV file, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select a specific time or time range on the tax
report, and click `PND3`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`PND53`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

This generates the `Tax Report PND3.csv`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
and `Tax Report PND53.csv`{.interpreted-text role="file"} files that
lists all the vendor bill lines with the applicable withholding tax.

![PND3 and PND53 CSV files](thailand/pnd3-pnd53.png)

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Odoo cannot generate the PND or PDF report or **withholding tax
certificate** directly. The generated
`Tax Report PND3.csv`{.interpreted-text role="file"} and
`Tax Report PND53.csv`{.interpreted-text role="file"} files must be
exported to an external tool to convert them into a **withholding PND**
report or a **PDF** file.
::::

## Tax invoice

The **tax invoice PDF** report can be generated from Odoo through the
**Invoicing** module. Users have the option to print PDF reports for
normal invoices and tax invoices. To print out **tax invoices**, users
can click on `Print Invoices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
Odoo. Regular invoices can be printed as **commercial invoices** by
clicking on `Cog button (⚙️) --> Print -->
Commercial Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

![Commercial invoice printing](thailand/tax-invoice.png)

### Headquarter/Branch number settings

You can inform a company\'s **Headquarters** and **Branch number** in
the **Contacts** app. Once in the app, open the **contact form** of the
company and under the `Sales & Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab:

- If the contact is identified as a branch, input the **Branch number**
  in the `Company ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
- If the contact is a **Headquarters**, leave the
  `Company ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field **blank**.

### End of service provision {#uae-end-of-service-provision}

The provision is defined as the total monthly allowance *divided* by 30
and then *multiplied* by the number of days set in the field
`Number of days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the bottom of a
contract\'s form.

The provision is then calculated via a salary rule associated with two
accounts: the **End Of Service Indemnity (Expense account)** and the
**End of Service Provision (Non-current Liabilities account)**. The
latter is used to pay off the **end of service amount** by settling it
with the **payables account**.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The end of service amount is calculated based on the gross salary and
the start and end dates of the employee's contract.
::::

### Invoices

The UAE localization package allows the generation of invoices in
English, Arabic, or both. The localization also includes a line to
display the **VAT amount** per line.

### Making Tax Digital (MTD)

In the UK, all VAT-registered businesses have to follow the MTD rules by
using software to submit their VAT returns.

The **UK - Accounting Reports** module enables you to comply with the
[HM Revenue &
Customs](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/)
requirements regarding [Making Tax
Digital](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-tax-digital/overview-of-making-tax-digital/).

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If your periodic submission is more than three months late, it is no
longer possible to submit it through Odoo, as Odoo only retrieves open
bonds from the last three months. Your submission has to be done
manually by contacting HMRC.
::::

#### Register your company to HMRC before the first submission {#uk_localization/hmrc-registration}

Go to `Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax report`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click on `Connect to HMRC`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Enter your company information on the HMRC platform.
You only need to do it once.

#### Periodic submission to HMRC

Import your obligations HMRC, filter on the period you want to submit,
and send your tax report by clicking `Send to HMRC`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

You can use dummy credentials to demo the HMRC flow. To do so, activate
the `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
go to `General Settings -->
Technical --> System Parameters`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. From here, search for
[l10n_uk_reports.hmrc_mode]{.title-ref} and change the value line to
[demo]{.title-ref}. You can get such credentials from the [HMRC
Developer Hub](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-test-user).
::::

#### Periodic submission to HMRC for multi-company

Only one company and one user can connect to HMRC simultaneously. If
several UK-based companies are on the same database, the user who
submits the HMRC report must follow these instructions before each
submission:

1.  Log into the company for which the submission has to be done.
2.  Go to `General Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and in
    the `Users`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, click
    `Manage Users`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Select the user
    who is connected to HMRC.
3.  Go to the `UK HMRC Integration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    tab and click `Reset Authentication
    Credentials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `Remove Authentication Credentials`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} button.
4.  You can now
    `register your company to HMRC <uk_localization/hmrc-registration>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and submit the tax report for this company.
5.  Repeat the steps for other companies\' HMRC submissions.

:::: note

# Fiscal localizations

## Fiscal localization packages {#fiscal_localizations/packages}

**Fiscal Localization Packages** are country-specific modules that
install pre-configured taxes, fiscal positions, chart of accounts, and
legal statements on your database. Some additional features, such as the
configuration of specific certificates, are also added to your
Accounting app, following your fiscal administration requirements.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Odoo continuously adds new localizations and improves the existing
packages.
::::

### Configuration

Odoo automatically installs the appropriate package for your company,
according to the country selected at the creation of the database.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

As long as you haven\'t posted any entry, you can still add and select
another package.
::::

To install a new package, go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Fiscal
Localization`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, click on
**Install More Packages**, and install your country\'s module.

# Adyen

[Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/) is a Dutch company that offers several
online payment possibilities.

::: seealso
\- `payment_providers/add_new`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} -
`../payment_providers`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Adyen works only with customers processing **more** than **10 million
annually** or invoicing a **minimum** of **1.000** transactions **per
month**.
::::

## Configuration

::: seealso
`payment_providers/add_new`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
:::

### Credentials tab

Odoo needs your **API Credentials** to connect with your Adyen account,
which comprise:

- **Merchant Account**: The code of the merchant account to use with
  Adyen.
- `API Key <adyen/api_and_client_keys>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:
  The API key of the webservice user.
- `Client Key <adyen/api_and_client_keys>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: The client key of the webservice user.
- `HMAC Key <adyen/hmac_key>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}: The HMAC
  key of the webhook.
- `Checkout API URL <adyen/urls>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}: The
  base URL for the Checkout API endpoints.
- `Recurring API URL <adyen/urls>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}: The
  base URL for the Recurring API endpoints.

You can copy your credentials from your Adyen account, and paste them in
the related fields under the **Credentials** tab.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If you are trying Adyen as a test, with an Adyen *test account*, head to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Payment Providers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. There, click on `Adyen`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, enable `Test Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and enter your credentials in the `Credentials`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.
::::

#### API Key and Client Key {#adyen/api_and_client_keys}

In order to retrieve the API Key and the Client Key, log into your Adyen
account, go to `Developers --> API Credentials`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

- If you already have an API user, open it.
- If you don\'t have an API user yet, click on **Create new
  credential**.

Go to `Server settings --> Authentification`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and copy or generate your **API Key**. Be careful
to copy your API key as you\'ll not be allowed to get it later without
generating a new one.

Now, head to `Client settings --> Authentification`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and cody or generate your **Client Key**. This is
also the place where you can `allow payments to be made from your
website <adyen/allowed_origins>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

#### HMAC key {#adyen/hmac_key}

In order to retrieve the HMAC Key, you\'ll need to configure a [Standard
Notification]{.title-ref} webhook. For this, log into your Adyen account
then go to `Developers --> Webhooks --> Add webhook
--> Add Standard notification`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

![Configure a webhook.](adyen/adyen-add-webhook.png){.align-center}

There, in `General --> Server configuration --> URL`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, enter your server address followed by
[/payment/adyen/notification]{.title-ref}.

![Enter the notification URL.](adyen/adyen-webhook-url.png){.align-center}

Then enter `Security --> HMAC Key --> Generate`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Be careful to copy the key as you will not be
allowed to do it later without generating a new one.

![Generate a HMAC key and save it.](adyen/adyen-hmac-key.png){.align-center}

You have to save the webhook to finalize its creation.

#### API URLs {#adyen/urls}

All Adyen API URLs include a customer area-specific prefix generated by
Adyen. To configure the URLs, proceed as follows:

1.  Log into your Adyen account, then go to
    `Developers --> API URLs`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

2.  Copy the `Prefix`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for your live
    Customer area (i.e., **data center**) and save it for later.

    ![Copy the prefix for the Adyen APIs](adyen/adyen-api-urls.png)

3.  In Odoo,
    `navigate to the payment provider Adyen <payment_providers/add_new>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

4.  In the `Checkout API URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
    enter the following URL and replace [yourprefix]{.title-ref} with
    the prefix you previously saved:
    [https://yourprefix-checkout-live.adyenpayments.com/checkout]{.title-ref}

5.  In the `Recurring API URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
    enter the following URL and replace [yourprefix]{.title-ref} with
    the prefix you previously saved:
    [https://yourprefix-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/Recurring]{.title-ref}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If you are trying Adyen as a test, you can use the following URLs
instead:

- `Checkout API URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  [https://checkout-test.adyen.com]{.title-ref}
- `Recurring API URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  [https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Recurring]{.title-ref}
::::

### Adyen Account

#### Allow payments from a specific origin {#adyen/allowed_origins}

To allow payment originated from your website, follow the steps in
`adyen/api_and_client_keys`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to navigate to
your API user and go to `Add allowed origins`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then add the URLs from where payments will be
made (the URLs of the servers hosting your Odoo instances).

![Allows payments originated from a specific domain.](adyen/adyen-allowed-origins.png){.align-center}

### Place a hold on a card

Adyen allows you to capture an amount manually instead of having an
immediate capture.

To set it up, enable the **Capture Amount Manually** option on Odoo, as
explained in the
`payment providers documentation <payment_providers/manual_capture>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Then, open your Adyen Merchant Account, go to
`Account --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and set
the **Capture Delay** to **manual**.

![Capture Delay settings in Adyen](adyen/adyen_capture_delay.png){.align-center}

:::: caution
::: title
Caution
:::

\- If you configure Odoo to capture amounts manually, make sure to set
the **Capture Delay** to **manual** on Adyen. Otherwise, the transaction
will be blocked in the authorized state in Odoo. - Odoo doesn\'t support
the partial capture yet. Be aware that if you make a partial capture
from Adyen\'s interface, Odoo will manage it as if it was a full
capture.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

After **7 days**, if the transaction hasn\'t been captured yet, the
customer has the right to **revoke** it.

# Authorize.Net

[Authorize.Net](https://www.authorize.net) is a United States-based
online payment solution provider, allowing businesses to accept **credit
cards**.

## Configuration

::: seealso
\- `payment_providers/add_new`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
:::

### Credentials tab

Odoo needs your **API Credentials & Keys** to connect with your
Authorize.Net account, which comprise:

- **API Login ID**: The ID solely used to identify the account with
  Authorize.Net.
- **API Transaction Key**
- **API Signature Key**
- **API Client Key**

To retrieve them, log into your Authorize.Net account, go to
`Account --> Settings
--> Security Settings --> API Credentials & Keys`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, generate your **Transaction Key** and **Signature
Key**, and paste them on the related fields in Odoo. Then, click on
**Generate Client Key**.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

To test Authorize.Net with a *sandbox* account, change the
`State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to `Test
Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. We recommend doing this on a
test Odoo database, rather than on your main database.

If you use the `Test Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with a
regular account, it results in the following error: *The merchant login
ID or password is invalid or the account is inactive*.
::::

### Configuration tab

#### Place a hold on a card

With Authorize.Net, you can enable the `manual capture
<payment_providers/manual_capture>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. If
enabled, the funds are reserved for 30 days on the customer\'s card, but
not charged yet.

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

After **30 days**, the transaction is **voided automatically** by
Authorize.Net.
::::

::: seealso
\- `../payment_providers`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
:::

## ACH payments (USA only)

`ACH (automated clearing house)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is an
electronic funds transfer system used between bank accounts in the
United States.

### Configuration

To give customers the possibility to pay using ACH, [sign up for
Authorize.Net eCheck\'s
service](https://www.authorize.net/payments/echeck.html). Once eCheck is
activated, duplicate the previously configured Authorize.Net payment
provider on Odoo by going to `Accounting
--> Configuration --> Payment Providers --> Authorize.net --> ⛭ Action --> Duplicate`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, change the provider\'s name to
differentiate both versions (e.g., [Authorize.net - Banks]{.title-ref}).

Open the `Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, set the
`Allow Payments From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
`Bank Account (USA only)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

When ready, change the provider\'s `State`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to `Enabled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for a
regular account or `Test Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for a
sandbox account.

## Import an Authorize.Net statement

### Export from Authorize.Net {#authorize-import-template}

::: admonition
Template

`Download the Excel import template. <authorize/authorize-net-magic-sheet.xlsx>`{.interpreted-text
role="download"}
:::

- Log in to Authorize.Net.
- Go to
  `Account --> Statements --> eCheck.Net Settlement Statement`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}.
- Define an export range using an *opening* and *closing* batch
  settlement. All transactions within the two batch settlements will be
  exported to Odoo.
- Select all transactions within the desired range, copy them, and paste
  them into the `Report 1 Download`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  sheet of the `Excel import template
  <authorize-import-template>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

![Selecting Authorize.Net transactions to import](authorize/authorize-report1.png)

In this case, the first batch (01/01/2021) of the year belongs to the
settlement of 12/31/2020, so the **opening** settlement is from
12/31/2020.
:::

Once the data is in the `Report 1 Download`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} sheet:

- Go to the `Transaction Search`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab
  on Authorize.Net.
- Under the `Settlement Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  section, select the previously used range of batch settlement dates in
  the `From:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `To:`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields and click
  `Search`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- When the list has been generated, click
  `Download to File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- In the pop-up window, select
  `Expanded Fields with CAVV Response/Comma Separated`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, enable `Include Column Headings`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, and click `Submit`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- Open the text file, select `All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  copy the data, and paste it into the `Report
  2 Download`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sheet of the
  `Excel import template <authorize-import-template>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- Transit lines are automatically filled in and updated in the
  `transit for report 1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `transit for report 2`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sheets of
  the `Excel import template
  <authorize-import-template>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Make sure
  all entries are present, and **if not**, copy the formula from
  previously filled-in lines of the
  `transit for report 1`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `2`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sheets and paste it into the
  empty lines.

### Import into Odoo

To import the data into Odoo:

- Open the
  `Excel import template <authorize-import-template>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- Copy the data from the `transit for report 2`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} sheet and use *paste special* to only paste the
  values in the `Odoo Import to CSV`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  sheet.
- Look for *blue* cells in the `Odoo Import to CSV`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} sheet. These are chargeback entries without any
  reference number. As they cannot be imported as such, go to
  `Authorize.Net --> Account --> Statements --> eCheck.Net Settlement Statement`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}.
- Look for `Charge Transaction/Chargeback`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, and click it.
- Copy the invoice description, paste it into the
  `Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} cell of the `Odoo
  Import to CSV`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sheet, and add
  [Chargeback /]{.title-ref} before the description.
- If there are multiple invoices, add a line into the
  `Excel import template
  <authorize-import-template>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for each
  invoice and copy/paste the description into each respective
  `Label`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line.

:::: note
::: title
Note

For **combined chargeback/returns** in the payouts, create a new line in
the `Excel import
template <authorize-import-template>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for
each invoice.
::::

::: example
![Chargeback description](authorize/authorize-chargeback-desc.png)
:::

- Next, delete *zero transaction* and *void transaction* line items, and
  change the format of the `Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  column in the `Odoo Import to CSV`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  sheet to *Number*.
- Go back to
  `eCheck.Net Settlement Statement --> Search for a Transaction`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"} and search again for the previously used batch
  settlements dates.
- Verify that the batch settlement dates on eCheck.Net match the related
  payments\' dates found in the `Date`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} column of the `Odoo Import to CSV`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- If it does not match, replace the date with the one from eCheck.Net.
  Sort the column by *date*, and make sure the format is
  [MM/DD/YYYY]{.title-ref}.
- Copy the data - column headings included - from the
  `Odoo Import to CSV`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sheet, paste
  it into a new Excel file, and save it using the CSV format.
- Open the Accounting app, go to
  `Configuration --> Journals`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
  tick the `Authorize.Net`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box, and
  click `Favorites --> Import records --> Load
  file`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Select the CSV file and

:::

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

The provider Ogone is deprecated. It is recommended to use
`stripe`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} instead.
::::

## Settings in Ogone

### Create an API user

Log into your Ogone account and head to the
`Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

You need to create an **API user** to be used in the creation of
transactions from Odoo. While you can use your main account to do so,
using an **API user** ensures that if the credentials used in Odoo are
leaked, no access to your Ogone configuration is possible. Additionally,
passwords for **API users** do not need to be updated regularly, unlike
normal users.

To create an **API user**, go to
`Configuration --> Users`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and
click on `New User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The following
fields must be configured:

::: {#ogone/ogone}
- `UserID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: you can choose anything
  you want.
- `User's Name, E-mail and Timezone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  you can enter the information you want.
- `Profile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: should be set to
  `Admin`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Special user for API`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: should be
  checked.
:::

After the creation of the user, you are required to generate a password.
Save the password and **UserID**, as they will be required later on
during the setup.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If you already have an user set up, make sure it is activated without
any error. If not, simply click the `Activate(Errors)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to reset the user.
::::

### Set up Ogone for Odoo

Ogone must now be configured to accept payments from Odoo. Head to
`Configuration -->
Technical Information --> Global Security Parameters`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select `SHA-512`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} as `Hash Algorithm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `UTF-8`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
`character encoding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, go to the
`Data and Origin verification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of
the same page and leave the URL field of the
`e-Commerce and Alias Gateway`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section blank.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

If you need to use another algorithm, such as [sha-1]{.title-ref} or
[sha-256]{.title-ref}, within Odoo, activate the
`developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and go
to the **Payment Providers** page in
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Payment Providers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click on `Ogone`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and in the `Credentials`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, select the algorithm you wish to use in the
`Hash function`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
::::

You are now required to generate **SHA-IN** passphrases. **SHA-IN** and
**SHA-OUT** passphrases are used to digitally sign the transaction
requests and responses between Odoo and Ogone. By using these secret
passphrases and the [sha-1]{.title-ref} algorithm, both systems can
ensure that the information they receive from the other was not altered
or tampered with.

Enter the same **SHA-IN** passphrase in both
`Checks for e-Commerce & Alias Gateway`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and
`Checks for DirectLink and Batch (Automatic)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. You can leave the IP address field blank.

Your **SHA-IN** and **SHA-OUT** passphrases should be different, and
between 16 and 32 characters long. Make sure to use the same **SHA-IN**
and **SHA-OUT** passphrases throughout the entire Ogone configuration,
as Odoo only allows a single **SHA-IN** and single **SHA-OUT**
passphrase.

In order to retrieve the **SHA-OUT** key, log into your Ogone account,
go to
`Configuration --> Technical Information --> Transaction feedback --> All
transaction submission modes`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and get or generate your **API Key** and **Client Key**. Be careful to
copy your API key as you'll not be allowed to get it later without
generating a new one.

When done, head to
`Configuration --> Technical Information --> Transaction Feedback`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and check the following options:

- The `URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields for
  `HTTP redirection in the browser`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  can be left empty, as Odoo will specify these URLs for every
  transaction request.
- `I would like to receive transaction feedback parameters on the redirection URLs`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: should be checked.
- `Direct HTTP server-to-server request`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: should to be set to [Online but switch to a deferred
  request when the online request fails]{.title-ref}.
- Both **URL** fields should contain the same following URL, with
  [\<example\>]{.title-ref} replaced by your database:
  [https://\<example\>/payment/ogone/return]{.title-ref}.
- `Dynamic eCommerce Parameters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  should contain the following values: [ALIAS]{.title-ref},
  [AMOUNT]{.title-ref}, [CARDNO]{.title-ref}, [CN]{.title-ref},
  [CURRENCY]{.title-ref}, [IP]{.title-ref}, [NCERROR]{.title-ref}
  [ORDERID]{.title-ref}, [PAYID]{.title-ref}, [PM]{.title-ref},
  [STATUS]{.title-ref}, [TRXDATE]{.title-ref}. Other parameters can be
  included (if you have another integration with Ogone that requires
  them), but are not advised.
- In the `All transaction submission modes`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} section, fill out **SHA-OUT** passphrase and disable
  [HTTP request for status change]{.title-ref}.

To allow your customers to save their credit card credentials for future
use, head to
`Configuration --> Alias --> My alias information`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. From this tab, you can configure how the user can

# PayPal

[Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/) is an American online payment provider
available worldwide, and one of the few that does not charge a
subscription fee.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

While PayPal is available in [over 200
countries/regions](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide),
only [a selection of currencies are
supported](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/reports/reference/paypal-supported-currencies).
::::

## Settings in PayPal

To access your PayPal account settings, log into PayPal, open the
`Account Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and open the
`Website payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} menu.

![PayPal account menu](paypal/paypal-account.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Note that for PayPal to work **in Odoo**, the options
`Auto Return <paypal/auto-return>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`PDT <paypal/pdt>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
`IPN <paypal/ipn>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} **must** all be
enabled.
::::

### Auto Return {#paypal/auto-return}

The **Auto Return** feature automatically redirects customers to Odoo
once the payment is processed.

From `Website payments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, go to
`Website preferences --> Update --> Auto
return for website payments --> Auto return`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select `On`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Enter the address of your Odoo database (e.g.,
[https://yourcompany.odoo.com]{.title-ref}) in the
`Return URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Any URL does the job. Odoo only needs the setting to be enabled since it
uses another URL.
::::

### Payment Data Transfer (PDT) {#paypal/pdt}

`PDT (Payment Data Transfer)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} allows to
receive payment confirmations, displays the payment status to the
customers, and verifies the authenticity of the payments. From `Website
preferences --> Update`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, scroll
down to `Payment data transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
select `On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

PayPal displays your **PDT Identity Token** as soon as
`Auto return <paypal/auto-return>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`Payment Data Transfer (PDT) <paypal/pdt>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
are enabled. If you need the **PDT Identity Token**, disable and
re-enable `Payment data transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
display the token again.
::::

### Instant Payment Notification (IPN) {#paypal/ipn}

`IPN (Instant Payment Notifications)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is
similar to **PDT**, but allows for more notifications, such as
chargeback notifications. To enable **IPN**, go to `Website
payments --> Instant payment notifications --> Update`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click `Choose IPN settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Enter a `Notification URL`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, select
`Receive IPN messages (Enabled)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### PayPal Account Optional

We advise not to prompt customers to log in with a PayPal account upon
payment. It is better and more accessible for customers to pay with a
debit/credit card. To disable that prompt, go to
`Account Settings --> Website payments --> Update`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select `On`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
for `PayPal account optional`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

### Payment Messages Format

If you use accented characters (or anything other than primary Latin
characters) for customer names or addresses, then you **must** configure
the encoding format of the payment request sent by Odoo to PayPal. If
you do not, some transactions fail without notice.

To do so, go to [your production
account](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/customerprofileweb?cmd=_profile-language-encoding).
Then, click `More Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and set
the two default encoding formats as `UTF-8`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

\- For Encrypted Website Payments & EWP_SETTINGS error, please check the
[Paypal documentation](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/online/). -
Configure your
`Paypal Sandbox account <paypal/testing>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
then follow this
[link](https://sandbox.paypal.com/cgi-bin/customerprofileweb?cmd=_profile-language-encoding)
to configure the encoding format in a test environment.
::::

## Settings in Odoo

::: seealso
`payment_providers/add_new`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

### Credentials

Odoo needs your **API Credentials** to connect with your PayPal account.
To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Payment Providers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and `Activate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
PayPal. Then, enter your PayPal account credentials in the
`Credentials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:

- `Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the login email address in
  Paypal;
- `PDT Identity Token`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the key used
  to verify the authenticity of transactions;
- `Use IPN`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enable for PayPal to
  work properly in Odoo.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Save the `PDT Identity Token`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for
later use.
::::

To set the `PDT Identity Token`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
switch to `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and retrieve the token by following the configuration steps
at `paypal/pdt`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The PayPal **Merchant ID** is not required in Odoo.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If you are trying PayPal as a test, using a
`PayPal Sandbox account <paypal/testing>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
change the `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Test Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. We recommend doing this
on a test Odoo database rather than on your main database.
::::

### Extra fees

You can charge
`extra fees <payment_providers/extra_fees>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to customers choosing to pay with PayPal in order to cover
the transaction fees PayPal charges you.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- You can refer to [Paypal
Fees](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees) to set up fees. -
[Traders in the
EU](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/shopping/pricing-payments/index_en.htm)
are not allowed to charge extra fees for paying with credit cards.
::::

## Test environment {#paypal/testing}

### Configuration

Thanks to PayPal sandbox accounts, you can test the entire payment flow
in Odoo.

Log into the [Paypal Developer Site](https://developer.paypal.com/)
using your PayPal credentials, which creates two sandbox accounts:

- A business account (to use as merchants, e.g.,
  <pp.merch01-facilitator@example.com>);
- A default personal account (to use as shoppers, e.g.,
  <pp.merch01-buyer@example.com>).

Log into PayPal sandbox using the merchant account and follow the same
configuration instructions. Enter your sandbox credentials in Odoo
(`Accounting --> Configuration --> Payment
Providers --> PayPal`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} in the
`Credentials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and make sure the
status is set on `Test Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. We
recommend doing this on a test Odoo database rather than your main
database.

Run a test transaction from Odoo using the sandbox personal account.

# Wire transfers

The **Wire transfer** payment method allows you to provide payment
instructions to your customers, such as the bank details and
communication. They are displayed:

- at the end of the checkout process, once the customer has selected
  `Wire transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as a payment method
  and clicked the `Pay now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button:

  ![Payment instructions at checkout](wire_transfer/payment_instructions_checkout.png)

- on the customer portal:

  ![Payment instructions on the customer portal](wire_transfer/payment_instructions_portal.png)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- While this method is very accessible and requires minimal setup, it
is very inefficient process-wise. We recommend setting up a
`payment provider <../payment_providers>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
instead. - Online orders remain in the
`Quotation sent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (i.e., unpaid order)
stage until you receive the payment and `Confirm`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} the order.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

**Wire transfer** can be used as a template for other payment methods
that are processed manually, such as checks, by renaming or duplicating
it.
::::

## Configuration

To configure **Wire Transfer**, go to
`Accounting / Website --> Configuration -->
Payment Providers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and open the
`Wire Transfer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} card. Then, in the
`Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:

- Select the `Communication`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to be
  used;
  - `Based on Document Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
    sales order or invoice number
  - `Based on Customer ID`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: customer
    identifier
- Tick the `Enable QR codes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} check
  box to activate `QR code payments
  <../accounting/customer_invoices/epc_qr_code>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.

Define the payment instructions in the `Messages`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab:

![Define payment instructions](wire_transfer/payment_instructions.png)

If you have already defined
`a bank account <../accounting/bank>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, the
account number will be automatically added to the default message
generated by Odoo.

## Migration from Ogone to Worldline {#worldline/ogone-migration}

As of January 1, 2026, Worldline, the company behind the Ogone payment
solution, no longer supports Ogone. Users of the
`Ogone payment provider <ogone>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} should
migrate to Worldline. To do so, follow these steps:

1.  Log into the [Worldline Merchant
    Portal](https://merchant-portal.preprod.worldline-solutions.com/dashboard)
    using your Ogone account credentials.
2.  Complete the
    `Worldline setup for Odoo <worldline/set-up>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}. The existing API key and secret can be reused; however,
    **a new webhook key and secret must be regenerated**.
3.  For on-premise installations or databases managed by a partner,
    update the Odoo installation as described in the
    `/administration/on_premise/update`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
    documentation, or by contacting your integrating partner.
4.  In Odoo, `install <general/install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    the `Payment Provider: Worldline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}

Odoo embeds several **payment providers** that allow your customers to
pay online, on their *customer portals*, or on your *eCommerce website*.
They can pay sales orders, invoices, or subscriptions with recurring
payments using their favorite payment methods, such as **credit cards**.

Note
:::

Odoo apps delegate the handling of sensitive information to the
certified payment provider so that you don\'t ever have to worry about
PCI compliance. No sensitive information (such as credit card numbers)
is stored on Odoo servers or Odoo databases hosted elsewhere. Instead,
Odoo apps use a unique reference number for the data stored safely in
the payment providers\' systems.

Note

\- Each provider has its own specific configuration flow, depending on
which feature is available. - Some of these online payment providers can
also be added as `bank accounts
<../finance/accounting/bank>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, but this is
**not** the same process as adding them as payment providers. Payment
providers allow customers to pay online, and bank accounts are added and
configured in the Accounting app to do a `bank reconciliation
<accounting/bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

In addition to the regular payment providers that integrate with an API,
such as Stripe, PayPal, or Adyen, Odoo bundles the
`Demo payment provider <payment_providers/demo>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. This payment provider allows you to test business flows
involving online payments. No credentials are required as the demo
payments are dummy payments.
::::

### Bank payments {#payment_providers/bank_payments}

- | `Wire Transfer <payment_providers/wire_transfer>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}
  | When selected, Odoo displays your payment information with a payment
    reference. You have to approve the payment manually once you have
    received it in your bank account.

- | `SEPA Direct Debit <../finance/accounting/payments/batch_sdd>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}
  | Your customers can make a bank transfer to register a SEPA Direct
    Debit mandate and get their bank account charged directly.

## Enabling a payment provider {#payment_providers/add_new}

To add a new payment provider and make its related payment methods
available to your customers, proceed as follows:

1.  Go to the payment provider\'s website, create an account, and make
    sure you have the API credentials requested for third-party use.
    These are necessary for Odoo to communicate with the payment
    provider.
2.  In Odoo, navigate to the `Payment providers`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} by going to `Accounting -->
    Configuration --> Payment Providers`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} or `Website --> Configuration --> Payment
    Providers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
3.  Select the provider and configure the
    `Credentials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
4.  Set the `State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
    `Enabled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
5.  Select a
    `payment journal <payment_providers/journal>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- The fields available in the `Credentials`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab depend on the payment provider. Refer to the
`related documentation <payment_providers/supported_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for more information. - Once you have enabled the payment
provider, it is automatically published on your website. If you wish to
unpublish it, click the `Published`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button. Customers cannot make payments through an unpublished provider,
but they can still manage
`(delete and assign to a subscription)`{.interpreted-text role="dfn"}
their existing tokens linked to such a provider.
::::

### Test mode {#payment_providers/test-mode}

If you wish to try the payment provider as a test, set the
`State`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field in the payment provider
form to `Test mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then enter your
provider\'s test/sandbox credentials in the
`Credentials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

By default, the payment provider remains **unpublished** in test mode so
that it\'s not visible to visitors.
::::

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

We recommend using the test mode on a duplicate or a test database to
avoid potential issues with your invoice numbering.
::::

## Payment form {#payment_providers/payment_methods}

You can change the payment provider's appearance on your website in the
`Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the selected
payment provider. Modify its name in the
`Displayed as`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field and adapt the
`Supported Payment Icons`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if
necessary.

## Tokenization {#payment_providers/tokenization}

`If the payment provider supports this feature <payment_providers/online_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, customers can save their payment method details for later.
To enable this feature, go to the `Configuration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of the selected payment provider and enable
`Allow Saving
Payment Methods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

In this case, a **payment token** is created in Odoo to be used as a
payment method for subsequent payments without the customer having to
enter their payment method details again. This is particularly useful
for the eCommerce conversion rate and subscriptions that use recurring
payments.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To add or delete their saved payment method details, customers can click
`Manage
payment methods`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`customer portal <users-portal-payment-methods>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
::::

::: admonition
PCI DSS and Attestation of Compliance

Odoo is not [PCI](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org) DSS-certified
because it does not store cardholder data or process payments. Instead,
it outsources tokenization and payment to
`external payment providers <payment_providers/online_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, which means that as an Odoo customer, you only need to
complete the minimal Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) with the
provider to obtain the Attestation of Compliance (AoC) and achieve PCI
compliance. Odoo should not be mentioned as a payment processor or a
third-party service provider in the
`SAQ (Self-Assessment Questionnaire)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.
:::

## Manual capture {#payment_providers/manual_capture}

`If the payment provider supports this feature <payment_providers/online_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, you can authorize and capture payments in two steps instead
of one. To enable this feature, go to the
`Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the selected
payment provider and enable `Capture Amount
Manually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

When you authorize a payment, the funds are reserved on the customer\'s
payment method but not immediately charged. They are charged when you
manually capture the payment later on. You can also void the
authorization to cancel it and release the reserved funds. Capturing
payments manually is helpful in many situations:

- Receive the payment confirmation and wait until the order is shipped
  to capture the payment.
- Review and verify that orders are legitimate before the payment is
  completed and the fulfillment process starts.
- Avoid potentially high refund fees for refunded payments: payment
  providers will not charge you for voiding an authorization.
- Hold a security deposit to return later, minus any deductions (e.g.,
  in case of damages).

To capture the payment after it was authorized, go to the related sales
order or invoice and click the `Capture Transaction`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. To release the funds, click the `Void
Transaction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Some payment providers support capturing only part of the authorized
amount. The remaining amount can then be either captured or voided.
These providers have the value **Full and partial** in the
`table above <payment_providers/online_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. The providers that only support capturing or voiding the
total amount have the value **Full only**. - The funds are likely not
reserved forever. After a certain time, they may be automatically
released back to the customer\'s payment method. Refer to your payment
provider\'s documentation for the exact reservation duration. - Odoo
does not support this feature for all payment providers, but some allow
the manual capture from their website interface.
::::

## Refunds {#payment_providers/refunds}

If your payment provider supports this feature, you can refund payments
directly from Odoo. It does not need to be enabled first. To refund a
customer payment, navigate to it and click the
`Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- Some payment providers support refunding only part of the amount. The
remaining amount can then optionally be refunded, too. These providers
have the value **Full and partial** in the
`table above <payment_providers/online_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. The providers that only support refunding the total amount
have the value **Full only**. - Odoo does not support this feature for
all payment providers, but some allow to refund payments from their
website interface.
::::

## Express checkout {#payment_providers/express_checkout}

`If the payment provider supports this feature <payment_providers/online_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, you can allow customers to use the
`Google Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Apple Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons and pay their
eCommerce orders in one click. When they use one of these buttons,
customers go straight from the cart to the confirmation page without
filling out the contact form. They just have to validate the payment on
Google\'s or Apple\'s payment form.

To enable this feature, go to the `Configuration`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of the selected payment provider and enable
`Allow Express Checkout`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

All prices shown on the express checkout payment form always include
taxes.

## Extra Fees {#payment_providers/extra_fees}

`If the payment provider supports this feature <payment_providers/online_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, you can add extra fees to online transactions. Fees can be
configured either as **fixed** amounts and percentages, **variable**
amounts and percentages, or both simultaneously. They can also differ
based on whether the transaction is **domestic** or **international**.

To enable this feature, go to the `Fees`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab of the selected payment provider, enable
`Add Extra Fees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and configure the
settings to your liking.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Fees are calculated on the tax-included price.
::::

## Availability

You can adapt the payment provider\'s availability by specifying the
`Maximum Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} allowed and
modifying the `Currencies`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Countries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

### Currencies and countries {#payment_providers/currencies_countries}

All payment providers have a different list of available currencies and
countries. They serve as a first filter during payment operations, i.e.,
the payment methods linked to the payment provider are not available for
selection if the customer\'s currency or country is not in the supported
list. As there might be errors, updates, and unknowns in the lists of
available currencies and countries, adding or removing a payment
provider\'s supported currencies or countries is possible.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

- `Payment methods <payment_providers/payment_methods>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} also have their own list of available currencies and
  countries that serves as another filter during payment operations.
- If the list of supported currencies or countries is empty, it means
  the list is too long to be displayed, or Odoo does not have
  information on that payment provider. The payment provider remains
  available, even though it is possible the payment will be refused at a
  later stage should the country or currency not be supported.
::::

### Maximum amount

You can restrict the `Maximum Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
that can be paid with the selected provider. Leave the field to
[0.00]{.title-ref} to make the payment provider available regardless of
the payment amount.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

This feature is not intended to work on pages that allow the customer to
update the payment amount, e.g., the **Donation** snippet and the
**Checkout** page when paid `shipping methods
<../websites/ecommerce/checkout_payment_shipping/shipping>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} are enabled.
::::

## Payment journal {#payment_providers/journal}

A `payment journal <accounting/bank>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} must
be defined for the payment provider to record the payments on an
**outstanding account**. To do so, go to the
`Configuration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the selected
payment provider and select a `Payment Journal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

\- The payment journal must be a `Bank`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} journal. - The same journal can be used for several
payment providers.
::::

### Accounting perspective

From an accounting perspective, there are two types of online payment
workflows: the payments that are directly deposited into your bank
account and follow the usual `reconciliation
<accounting/bank/reconciliation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
workflow, and those coming from third-party `online payment
providers <payment_providers/online_providers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and require you to follow another accounting workflow. For
these payments, you need to consider how you want to record your
payments\' journal entries. We recommend you ask your accountant for
advice.

By default, the `Bank Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
defined for the `payment journal
<payment_providers/journal>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is used, but
you can also specify an `outstanding account
<bank/outstanding-accounts>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for each
payment provider to separate the provider\'s payments from other
payments.

# Hardware

## Kiosk management

A kiosk is a self-service station that allows employees to check in and
check out for work shifts.

There are two ways to set up a kiosk:

- **Laptop and desktop PC**

  Running a kiosk in a web browser is the cheapest and most flexible
  option. You can print employee badges with any thermal or inkjet
  printer compatible with your web browser.

- **Tablet and mobile phone (Android or iOS)**

  Tablets and mobile phones take up much less space, and their
  touchscreens are easy to use. Consider putting them in a secure stand
  at the front desk or mounting them securely on a wall.

  :::: tip
  ::: title

  We recommend using an iPad together with the [Heckler Design WindFall
  Stand](https://hecklerdesign.com/products/windfall-stand-for-ipad)
  ::::

## RFID key fob readers

Employees can scan personal RFID key fobs with an RFID reader to manage
check-ins and check-outs quickly and easily.

## Barcode scanners

Employees can scan the barcode on their employee badges to manage

most USB barcode scanners connected directly to a computer. Bluetooth
barcode scanners are also supported natively.

# Create a new employee

When a new employee is hired, the first step is to create a new employee
record. Starting in the `Employees`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} app dashboard, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button and a new employee form appears. Fill out the
required information and any additional details.

![Create a new employee form with all fields filled out.](new_employee/new-employee-form.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The current company phone number and name is populated in the
`Work Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields.
::::

## General information

The employee form automatically saves as data is entered, but the save
manually icon (a could with an up arrow inside it) may be clicked at any
time to manually save the form.

### Required fields

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the employee\'s name.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the company from
  the drop-down menu that the new employee is hired by, or create a new
  company by typing the name in the field.

![A new employee form with the required fields highlighted.](new_employee/employee-new.png){.align-center}

### Optional fields

- `Photo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: In the top right image box
  of the employee form, click on the `✏️
  (pencil)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} edit icon to select a
  photo to upload.

- `Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  employee\'s job position title under their name, or select the job
  position from the `Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  drop-down menu to have this field auto-populate. The
  `Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field under the
  employee name can be modified and does not need to match the selection
  made in the `Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  drop-down.

  ::: example
  It is recommended to have the job positions match, but if desired, the
  typed-in description in this field can contain more information than
  the selected drop-down job position.

  An example where this may be applicable is if someone is hired for a
  sales representative position configured as
  `Sales Representative`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
  *Recruitment* app, and that is selected for the drop-down
  `Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

  In the typed in job position field beneath the employee\'s name, the
  position could be more specific, such as [Sales Representative -
  Subscriptions]{.title-ref} if the employee is focused solely on
  subscription sales.

  ![Both job position fields entered but with different information.](new_employee/job-description-fields.png){.align-center}
  :::

- Tags: Click on a tag in the drop-down menu to add any tags applicable
  to the employee. Any tag can be created in this field by typing it in.
  Once created, the new tag is available for all employee records. There
  is no limit to the amount of tags that can be added.

- Work Contact Information: Enter the employee\'s
  `Work Mobile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Work Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Work Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and/or
  `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} name.

- `Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  employee\'s department from the drop-down menu.

- `Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  employee\'s job position from the drop-down menu. Once a selection is
  made, the `Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
  beneath the employee\'s name automatically updates to reflect the
  currently selected job position. These positions are from the
  `Recruitment <../../hr/recruitment/new_job/>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} application, and reflect the currently configured job
  positions.

- `Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the employee\'s
  manager from the drop-down menu.

- `Coach`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the employee\'s
  coach from the drop-down menu.

- `Next Appraisal Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This date
  automatically populates with a date that is computed according to the
  settings configured in the *Appraisals* application. This date can be
  modified using the calendar selector.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

After a `Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, if the
`Coach`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is blank, the selected
manager automatically populates the `Coach`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

To make edits to the selected `Department`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Coach`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click the
`Internal Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} arrow next to the
respective selection. The `Internal Link`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} arrow opens the selected form, allowing for
modifications. Click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} after any
edits are made.
::::

## Additional information tabs

### Resumé tab

#### Resumé

Next, enter the employee\'s work history in the
`Resumé`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Each resumé line must
be entered individually. When creating an entry for the first time,
click `Create a new
entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Create Resumé lines`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form appears.
After an entry is added, the `Create a new entry`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button is replaced with an `Add`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. Enter the following information for each entry.

- `Date Start`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Date End`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the start and end
  dates for the work experience. To select a date, use the
  `< (left)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `> (right)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} arrow icons to scroll
  to the desired month, then click on the day to select it.
- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter any relevant
  details in the field.

Once all the information is entered, click the
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button if there is
only one entry to add, or click the `Save & New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to save the current entry and create another
resumé line.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

After the new employee form is saved, the current position and company
is automatically added to the `Resumé`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, with the end date listed as *current*.
::::

#### Skills

An employee\'s skills can be entered in the `Resumé`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab in the same manner that a resumé line is created.
When creating a skill for the first time, click the
`Create a new entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button under
`Skills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a
`Create Skills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form appears. After a
skill is added, the `Create a new entry`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button is replaced with an `Add`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. Enter the following information for each skill.

![A skill form with the information filled out.](new_employee/create-skills.png){.align-center}

- `Skill Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select a
  `skill type <employees/skill-types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} by
  clicking the radio button next to the skill type.
- `Skill`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: After selecting a
  `Skill Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the corresponding
  skills associated with that selected `Skill Type`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} appear in a drop-down menu. For example, selecting
  `Language`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as the
  `Skill Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} presents a variety of
  languages to select from under the `Skills`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field. Select the appropriate pre-configured skill,
  or type in a new skill, then click
  `Create "(new skill)"`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Skill Level`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Pre-defined skill
  levels associated with the selected `Skill
  Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appear in a drop-down menu.
  First, select a `Skill Level`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then
  the progress bar automatically displays the pre-defined progress for
  that specific skill level. Skill levels and progress can be modified
  in the `Skill Level`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up form,
  which is accessed via the `Internal Link`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} arrow next to `Skill Level`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field.

Once all the information is entered, click the
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button if there is
only one skill to add, or click the `Save & New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to save the current entry and immediately create
a new entry.

To delete any line from the `Resumé`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tab, click the `🗑️ (trash can)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon
to delete the entry. Add a new line by clicking the
`Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to the
corresponding section.

##### Skill Types {#employees/skill-types}

In order to add a skill to an employee\'s form, the
`Skill Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be configured. Go
to
`Employees app --> Configuration --> Employee: Skill Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to view the currently configured skill types and
create new skill types. Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and a new `Skill
Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form appears. Fill out all the
details for the new skill type. Repeat this for all the skill types
needed.

- `Skill Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the name of the
  skill type. This will act as the parent category for more specific
  skills and should be generic.

- `Skills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Click
  `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and enter the name for
  the new skill, then repeat for all other needed skills.

- `Levels`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Click
  `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a
  `Create Levels`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form appears. Enter
  the name of the level, and assign a number for the
  `Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} percentage (0-100) for
  that level. Click `Save & New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
  save the entry and add another level, or click
  `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the level
  and close the form. Once all the levels are entered, click the
  `Save manually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon at the top of
  the screen. Next, select a default level for this skill type. Click
  `Set Default`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the line to be the
  default value. This is typically the lowest level, but any level can
  be set as the default. A check mark appears in the
  `Default Level`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, indicating
  which level is the default.

  ::: example
  To add a math skill set, enter [Math]{.title-ref} in the
  `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Next, in the
  `Skills`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, enter
  [Algebra]{.title-ref}, [Calculus]{.title-ref}, and
  [Trigonometry]{.title-ref}. Last, in the `Levels`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field enter [Beginner]{.title-ref},

### Work Information tab {#employees/work-info-tab}

The Work Information tab is where the employee\'s specific job related
information is housed. Their working schedule, various roles, who
approves their specific requests (time off, timesheets, and expenses),
and specific work location details are listed here. Click on the `Work
Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab to access this
section, and enter the following information for the new employee.

- `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  `Work Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down
  menu. To modify the address, hover over the first line (if there are
  multiple lines) of the address to reveal an
  `Internal Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} arrow. Click the
  `Internal Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} arrow to open up
  the company form, and make any edits. Use the breadcrumb menu to

  address is needed, add the address by typing it in the field, then
  click `Create (new address)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add
  the address, or `Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} to add the new address and edit the address form.

- `Approvers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: In order to see this
  section, the user must have either `Administrator`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} or `Officer: Manage all employees`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} rights set for the `Employees`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} application. Using the drop-down menus, select the
  users responsible for approving `Expenses`{.interpreted-text

  `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Phone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Mobile`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, and `Default Warehouse`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} fields. These can be modified, if needed. Use the
  breadcrumb menu to navigate back to the new employee form when done.

- `Homeworking`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the specific location the employee will work from, for
  each day of the week. The default options are `Home`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Office`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Other`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. A new location can be
  typed into the field, then click either
  `Create (new location)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add the
  location, or `Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  to add the new location and edit the form. After edits are done, click
  `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the new
  location is added, and populates the field. For days the employee does
  not work, for example, Saturday and Sunday, leave the field blank
  (`Unspecified`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  It is also possible to add or modify work locations by navigating to
  `Employees
  app --> Configuration --> Employee: Work Locations`{.interpreted-text
  role="menuselection"}. Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  to create a new location, then enter the details on the form. To
  modify a location, click on an existing location, then make any
  changes on the form.
  ::::

- `Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Timezone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the employee. The
  `Internal Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} arrow opens up a
  detailed view of the specific daily working hours. Working hours can
  be modified or deleted here.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  Working hours can also be modified in the *Payroll* application, where
  they are referred to as `Working Schedules`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. For more information on how to create or modify
  `Working Schedules`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in Payroll,
  refer to the `../../hr/payroll`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
  documentation.
  ::::

- `Planning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Click on a role from
  the drop-down menu for both the `Roles`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} and the `Default Role`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} fields to add a role. There is no limit to the amount
  of `Roles`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that can be selected for
  an employee, but there can only be one
  `Default Role`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The default role is
  the *typical* role that the employee performs, where the
  `Roles`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are *all* the specific
  roles the employee is able to perform. The
  `Default Role`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} must be selected as
  a `Role`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, if not, when the
  `Default Role`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, that
  role is automatically added to the list of `Roles`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

The `Planning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section affects the
*Planning* app, and will only appear if the *Planning* app is installed.
When planning work in the *Planning* app, employees can only be
scheduled for specific work that corresponds to their selected roles.
For example, only an employee with a *Functional Tester* role can be
assigned to perform any activity that requires a *Functional Tester*.
::::

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The users that appear in the drop-down menu for the
`Approvers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section must have
*Administrator* rights set for the corresponding human resources role.
To check who has these rights, go to
`Settings app --> Users --> → Manage Users`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click on an employee, and check the
`Human Resources`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
`Access Rights`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

- In order for the user to appear as an approver for
  `Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, they must have either
  `Team Approver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `All Approver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set for the
  `Expenses`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} role.
- In order for the user to appear as an approver for
  `Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, they must have either
  `Officer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set for the
  `Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} role.
- In order for the user to appear as an approver for
  `Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, they must have either
  `Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Officer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} set for the
  `Payroll`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} role.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are related to a
company\'s working times, and an employee cannot have working hours that
are outside of a company\'s working times.

Each individual working time is company-specific, so for multi-company
databases, each company needs to have its own working hours set.

If an employee\'s working hours are not configured as a working time for
the company, new working times can be added, or existing working times
can be modified. To add or modify a working time, go to the
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Working Times`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and add a new working time or edit an existing
one.

After the new working time is created, or an existing one is modified,
select the employee\'s working hours using the drop-down menu in the
`Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
`Work Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.
::::

### Private Information tab

No information in the `Private Information`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab is required to create an employee, however, some
information in this section may be critical for the company\'s payroll
department. In order to properly process payslips and ensure all

# Create new vehicles

Odoo\'s *Fleet* app manages all vehicles and the accompanying
documentation that comes with vehicle maintenance and driver\'s records.

All vehicles are organized on the main `Fleet`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard. Each vehicle has its own *vehicle form*,
which is displayed as a card in the kanban view, according to it\'s
status. Every vehicle form is displayed in its current corresponding
kanban stage. The default stages are `New Request`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `To Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Ordered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Registered`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Downgraded`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Reserve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Waiting List`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To add a new vehicle to the fleet, click the `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, and a blank vehicle form loads. Enter the
vehicle information in the vehicle form, then click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Vehicle form fields

- `Model`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the vehicle\'s
  model from the drop-down menu. If the model is not listed, type in the
  model name and click either `Create`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} or `Create and Edit`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- `License Plate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the
  vehicle\'s license plate number in this field.
- `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select any tags from the
  drop-down menu, or type in a new tag. There is no limit on the amount
  of tags that can be selected.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Model`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is the only required
field on the new vehicle form. When a model is selected, other fields
will appear on the vehicle form, and relevant information will
auto-populate fields that apply to the model. If some of the fields do
not appear, this may indicate there is no model selected.
::::

### Driver section

This section of the vehicle form relates to the person who is currently
driving the car, as well as any plans for a change in the driver in the
future, and when.

- `Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the driver from
  the drop-down menu, or type in a new driver and click either
  `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Create and Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Mobility Card`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the selected
  driver has a mobility card listed on their employee card in the
  *Employees* application, the mobility card number will appear in this
  field. If there is no mobility card listed and one should be added,
  `edit the employee card
  <employees/hr-settings>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} in the
  *Employees* application.
- `Future Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the next driver
  for the vehicle is known, select the next driver from the drop-down
  menu, or type in the next driver and click either
  `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Create and Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Plan To Change Car`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the
  current driver set for this vehicle plans to change their vehicle,
  either because they are waiting on a new vehicle that is being
  ordered, or this is a temporary vehicle assignment and they know which
  vehicle they will be driving next, check this box. If the current
  driver does not plan to change their vehicle and use this current
  vehicle, do not check this box.
- `Assignment Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the date
  the vehicle will be available for another driver using the drop-down
  calendar. Select the date by navigating to the correct month and year
  using the `⬅️ (left arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `➡️ (right arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icons, then
  click on the specific day. If this field is blank, this indicates the
  vehicle is currently available and can be reassigned to another
  driver. If it is populated, the vehicle will not be available to
  assign to another driver until the date entered.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

A driver does **not** have to be an employee, but a driver must be
listed in the *Contacts* application. When creating a new driver, the
driver is added to the *Contacts* application, not the *Employees*
application.
::::

  known odometer reading in the number field. Using the drop-down menu
  next to the number field, select whether the odometer reading is in
  kilometers `(km)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or miles
  `(mi)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Fleet Manager`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the fleet
  manager from the drop-down menu, or type in a new fleet manager and
  click either `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Create and Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: type in the location
  for the vehicle in the field. The most common scenario for when this
  field would be populated is if a company has several office locations.
  The typical office location where the vehicle is located would be the
  location entered.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the company that
  the vehicle will be used for and associated with from the drop-down
  menu, or type in a new company and click either
  `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Create and Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

# Services

To properly maintain a fleet of vehicles, regular maintenance as well as
periodic repairs are needed. Scheduling repairs and managing services
for an entire fleet is necessary to ensure all vehicles are in good
working order when they are needed.

## Create a service record

To log a service, go to the main services dashboard by navigating to
`Fleet app -->
Fleet --> Services`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Click
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a service form appears.
Fill in the information on the form and click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The only two fields that are required to be populated
are `Service Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The fields are:

- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter in a short
  description of the service.
- `Service Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the type of
  service performed from the drop-down menu, or type in a new type of
  service and click either `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  or `Create & Edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This list is
  not pre-configured in Odoo. When creating a fleet and logging a
  service, the types of service need to be created.
- `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: using the calendar module,
  select the date the service was provided or is scheduled to be
  performed. Navigate to the desired month using the left and right
  arrow icons, then click on the date to select it.
- `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the cost of the
  service.
- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the vendor who
  performed the service from the drop-down menu. If the vendor has not
  already been entered in the system, type in the vendor name and click
  either `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add them, or
  `Create & Edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create the
  vendor and edit the vendor form. The vendor form allows for other
  details aside form the name to be entered, such as contact
  information.
- `Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the vehicle that
  was serviced from the drop-down menu. When the vehicle is selected,
  the `Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is populated,
  and the unit of measure for the `Mileage`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field appears.
- `Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the current driver listed
  for the selected vehicle is populated when the
  `Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected. If the
  driver needs to be changed, another driver can be selected from the
  drop-down menu.
- `Odometer Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the
  odometer reading when the service was done. The units of measure will
  either be in kilometers (`km`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) or
  miles (`mi`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}). When the
  `Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, the units of
  measure is populated. This comes from the vehicle form. To change from
  kilometers to miles, or vice versa, click the
  `External Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to the
  vehicle selected in the `Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  field. Change the unit of measure, then click `Save`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. the unit of measure will be updated in the
  `Odometer Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

  repair in the notes tab at the bottom of the service form.

![Enter the information for a new service. The required fields are Service Type and Vehicle.](service/new-service.png){.align-center}

## List of services

To view all services logged in the database, including old and new
requests, go to
`Fleet application --> Fleet --> Services`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. All services appear in a list view, including all
the details for each service.

Each service listed displays the following information:

- `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the date service or repair
  was performed or is requested to be performed.
- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a short description
  of the specific type of service or repair performed to clarify the
  specific service.
- `Service Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the service or
  repair performed. This is selected from a list of services that must
  be configured.
- `Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the specific vehicle the
  service was performed on.
- `Driver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: who the current driver is
  for the vehicle.
- `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the specific vendor who
  performed the service or repair.
- `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the total cost for the
  service or repair.
- `Notes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: any information associated
  with the service or repair that is documented to add clarification.
- `Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the status of the service
  or repair. Options are `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Running`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Canceled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![The full list of services in the Odoo database.](service/services.png){.align-center}

### View services

It is recommended to view the list of services in one of several
pre-configured ways to better view the information presented. In the top
right corner of the list, there are several icons that when clicked,
sort the data in different ways.

![The icons in the top right corner than cn be clicked to present the information in
different ways.](service/views.png){.align-center}

#### List view

The default view of the services is the list view. This presents all the
services in chronological order, from oldest to newest, in a list.

The information can be sorted by any column. At the top of each column,
hover over the column name. An arrow appears to the right of the name.
Click the arrow to sort the data by that specific column.

The default sorting is descending alphabetical order (A to Z). Click the
arrow again to reverse the order, and go in reverse alphabetical order
(Z to A). The one exception to this sorting is the default
`Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, which sorts the
information in chronological order (January to December) instead of
alphabetical order.

#### Kanban view

To view services by their stage, click on the
`Kanban icon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which is the second
icon in the top right, and appears as four black squares in a cube.

All the services with the same status appear in the corresponding
column, from `Running`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
`Cancelled`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To change the status of
a service, simply click and drag the service card to the desired stage.

#### Graph view

Another way to view the data is in a graph. To view the graph, click the
`Graph icon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which is the third icon
in the top right, and appears as a small graph.

The graph displays the information in a graph where the X axis
represents the `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the Y axis
represents the `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Each column
represents a single month, and then is further organized by vehicle.
Each vehicle is represented by a different color, and each month\'s bar
is divided by each vehicle.

#### Pivot view

The final way to view the service data is in a spreadsheet pivot table.
Click on the `Pivot icon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which is
the last icon in the top right, and appears as a small spreadsheet.

The data presented in the table shows the cost of each service or
repair. The rows represent the vendors, and each vehicle that was
serviced by them appears beneath each vendor. The column represent the
different service types performed.

The table can be inserted in a spreadsheet or downloaded. To add the
pivot table to a spreadsheet in Odoo, click
`Insert In Spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a pop-up
appears. Select the spreadsheet the data should be added to from the
drop-down menu, and click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
The spreadsheet then loads on the screen. The spreadsheets are stored in
Odoo\'s *Documents* application. To download the table in an
[xlsx]{.title-ref} format, click the `Download`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon.

`model categories <fleet/categories>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

## Settings {#fleet/settings}

To access the settings menu, go to
`Fleet application --> Configuration -->
Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. There are only two
settings that need configuration, the vehicle contract end date alert
delay, and a new vehicle request limit.

![Settings available for the Fleet application.](fleet/fleet-settings.png){.align-center}

### End Date Contract Alert

The `End Date Contract Alert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
defines an alert delay for the persons responsible for vehicle
contracts. The responsible person(s) will receive an email informing
them a vehicle contract is about to expire in the number of days defined
in this field.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To determine who the responsible person is for a contract, open an
individual contract. The person listed as
`Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} under the
`Contract Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
contract is the person who will receive the alert.

To access all contracts, navigate to
`Fleet app --> Fleet --> Contracts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and all contracts appear in the list. Click on a
`Contract`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to view it.

An individual contract can also be found by navigating to
`Fleet app --> Fleet -->
Fleet`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} and clicking on an
individual vehicle. On the vehicle form, click the
`Contracts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the top
of the page. The contract(s) associated with this vehicle only appears
in the list. Click on an individual contract to open it. The
`Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} person is listed on the
contract.
::::

### New Vehicle Request

The `New Vehicle Request`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field sets
a limit on how many new vehicles are requested based on fleet
availability. An employee filling out the salary configurator form
(after being offered a position), will *not* be able to request a new
car if the number of existing cars is greater than the number specified
in the `New Vehicle Request`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
Enter the specific number limit for existing available cars in this
field.

::: example
If the `New Vehicle Request`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} limit is
set to 20 vehicles, and there are 25 vehicles available, an employee
would not be able to request a new vehicle. If there are only 10 cars
available, then the employee would be able to request a new vehicle.

## Manufacturers {#fleet/manufacturers}

Odoo *Fleet* comes pre-configured with sixty-six commonly used car and
bicycle manufacturers in the database, along with their logos. To view
the pre-loaded manufacturers, go to `Fleet
app --> Configuration --> Manufacturers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

The manufacturers appear in a list view in alphabetical order. Each
manufacturer\'s card lists how many specific models are configured for
each particular manufacturer. Odoo comes with forty six pre-configured
`models <fleet/models>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} from four major
auto manufacturers and one major bicycle manufacturer: Audi, BMW,
Mercedes, Opel (cars), and Eddy Merckx (bicycle).

![Manufacturer card with the amount of models listed.](fleet/manufacturer.png){.align-center}

### Add a manufacturer

To add a new manufacturer to the database, click
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. A manufacturer form will
load. Only two pieces of information are needed, the
`Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the manufacturer, and the
logo. Type the name of the manufacturer in the name field, and select an
image to upload for the logo. When the information is entered, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Vehicle Models {#fleet/models}

Many manufacturers have a variety of models that they produce. When
adding a vehicle to the fleet, it is important to specify the vehicle
model being added. Odoo comes with pre-configured car models from four
major auto manufacturers, and one pre-configured bicycle model from one
bicycle manufacturer: Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Opel (cars), and Eddy Merckx
(bicycle). If a vehicle *other* than the pre-configured models from
these manufacturers are part of a fleet, the model (and/or manufacturer)
needs to be added to the database.

### Preconfigured Models

The following models are pre-loaded in Odoo and do not need to be added
to the database:

  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  AUDI    BMW            Eddy Merckx   Mercedes    Opel
  ------- -------------- ------------- ----------- ---------------

### Add a new model {#fleet/add-model}

New vehicle models can easily be added to the database. To add a new
model, navigate to
`Fleet app --> Configuration --> Vehicle Models`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and a vehicle model form will load. Enter the following information on
the form, then click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Be
advised, some fields are specific to Belgian based companies, so not all
fields or sections may be visible depending on the location of the
company.

- `Model name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the model name
  in the field.
- `Manufacturer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the
  manufacturer from the drop-down menu. If the manufacturer is not
  configured, type in the manufacturer and then click
  `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Create &
  Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Vehicle Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select one of two
  preconfigured vehicle types, either `Car`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} or `Bike`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, from
  the drop-down menu. The vehicle types are hardcoded in Odoo and are
  integrated with the *Payroll* application since vehicles can be part
  of an employee\'s benefits. Adding additional vehicle types is not
  possible as it will affect payroll.
- `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the category the
  vehicle is categorized under from the drop-down menu. To create a new
  category, type in the category and then click `Create (new
  category)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

##### Salary

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Salary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section only appears for
Belgian-based companies, and only if the company has their localization
setting set to Belgium. The cost values are all **monthly** with the
exception of the `Catalog Value (VAT Incl.)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
::::

- `Can be requested`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: check this box
  if employees can request this model vehicle.

  the `MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail
  Price)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the vehicle at the time of
  purchase or lease.
- `C02 fee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this value is
  automatically calculated based on Belgian laws and regulations, and
  cannot be modified. The value is based on the value entered in the
  `CO2 Emissions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field in the
  `Engine`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the vehicle
  form.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Modifying the `CO2 Emissions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
will adjust the value in the `CO2 fee`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.
::::

- `Cost (Depreciated)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the
  monthly cost for the vehicle, which appears in the salary configurator
  that is available to a future employee when they are offered a job
  position. This value impacts the gross and net salary of the employee
  who is assigned to the vehicle. This figure is depreciated over time
  according to local tax laws. The
  `Cost (Depreciated)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} does not
  depreciate automatically on the *vehicle model*, it only depreciates
  based on the *contract* linked to a specific vehicle and not on the
  general model.
- `Total Cost (Depreciated)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this
  value is the `Cost (Depreciated)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  and the `C02 fee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields combined,
  and also is depreciated over time.

##### Engine

- `Fuel Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the type of
  fuel the vehicle uses form the drop-down menu. The options are
  `Diesel`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Gasoline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},

  carbon dioxide emissions the vehicle produces in grams per kilometer
  (g/km). This information is provided by the car manufacturer.
- `CO2 Standard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the standard
  amount of carbon dioxide in grams per kilometer (g/km) for a similar
  sized vehicle.
- `Transmission`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the
  transmission type from the drop-down menu, either
  `Manual`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Automatic`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  or hybrid, enter the power the vehicle uses in kilowatts (kW).
- `Horsepower`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the vehicle\'s
  horsepower in this field.
- `Horsepower Taxation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the
  amount that is taxed based on the size of the vehicle\'s engine. This
  is determined by local taxes and regulations, and varies depending on
  the location. It is recommended to check with the accounting
  department to ensure this value is correct.
- `Tax Deduction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field
  auto-populates according to the engine specifications, and cannot be
  modified. The percentage is based on the localization settings and
  local tax laws.

#### Vendors tab

Vehicle specific vendors, such as car dealerships, are not listed
separately from other vendors. The vendors that a vehicle can be
purchased from also appear in the list of vendors used by the *Purchase*
app.

The vendor(s) the vehicle can be purchased from may be added in this
tab. To add a vendor, click `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and a pop-up loads with a list of all the vendors currently in the
database. Select the vendor to add by clicking the checkbox next to the
vendor name, then click `Select`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
There is no limit to the number of vendors that can be added to this
list.

If a vendor is not in the database, add a vendor by clicking
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. A vendor form will load.
Enter the information in the vendor tab, then click
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add the vendor and
close the window, or `Save & New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
add the current vendor and create another new vendor.

## Model Category {#fleet/categories}

To best organize a fleet, it is recommended to have vehicle models
housed under a specific category, to more easily see what kinds of
vehicles are in the fleet. Model categories are set on the
`vehicle model form <fleet/add-model>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

To view all the models currently set up, navigate to
`Fleet application -->
Configuration --> Model Category`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. All models are displayed in a list view.

### Add a new model category

To add a new category, click `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. A new entry line appears at the bottom of the list.
Type in the new category, then click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to save the entry.

To reorganize how the categories appear in the list, click on the up and
down arrows to the left of the category to be moved, and drag the line
to the desired position. The order of the list does not affect the
database in any way. However, it may be preferable to view the vehicle
categories in a specific order, for example, by size, or the numbers of
passengers the vehicle can carry.

# Contracts

Every employee in Odoo is required to have a contract in order to be
paid. A contract outlines the terms of an employee\'s position, their
compensation, working hours, and any other details about their position.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

Contract documents (PDFs) are uploaded and organized using the
*Documents* application, and are signed using the *Sign* application.
Ensure these applications are installed in order to send and sign
contracts. Please refer to the
`/applications/productivity/documents`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
`/applications/productivity/sign`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation.

template populates the fields in the
`Salary Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Any
additional tabs, such as `Personal Documents`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, appears if applicable.

### Salary information

![Optional tabs for a new contract.](contracts/salary-info.png){.align-center}

This section is where the specific salary details are defined. This
section is country-specific, so these fields vary, depending on where
the company is located.

Enter the amount in the various fields, or tick a checkbox to apply a
benefit. Some options that can be entered here include
`Group Insurance Sacrifice Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Canteen Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, for example.

Some fields may be automatically filled in as other fields are entered.
For example, the `Yearly Cost (Real)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `Monthly Cost (Real)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} updates
once the `Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is populated.

### Personal documents

This tab **only** appears after an `Employee`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is selected, and houses any documents that are linked
to the employee on their employee record. Documents cannot be added to
this tab, this tab **only** shows documents that are already uploaded
and associated with the employee.

The available documents in this tab can be downloaded. Click the
`fa-download`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(download)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon next to the
document to download it.

### Save and send the contract

Once a contract has been created and/or modified, save the contract by
clicking the `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. Next, the
contract must be sent to the employee to be signed.

Click on one of the following buttons to send the contract to the
employee:

![Send the contract to the employee via one of the buttons.](contracts/send-contract.png){.align-center}

- `Generate Simulation Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this
  option is **only** for Belgian companies. Clicking this opens a pop-up
  window that contains the basic information from the contract, as well
  as a link for the contract when using the salary configurator. Click
  `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to send an email to the
  employee, so they can sign the contract.

  ![Sends a link to the employee for the contract.](contracts/simulation.png){.align-center}

  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  In order to send a contract using the
  `Generate Simulation Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, there
  **must** be a signature field in the contract PDF being sent to the
  employee, so they can sign it.
  ::::

- `Signature Request`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: clicking this
  reveals a pop-up window, where an email can be typed to the employee.
  Select the document (such as a contract, NDA, or Homeworking Policy)
  from the drop-down menu, and fill out the email section. Click
  `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} when the email is ready to
  be sent.

### Salary attachments

Any automatic deductions or allocations for an employee, such as child
support payments and wage garnishments, are referred to as a *salary
attachment*. This section is where all of these deductions or
allocations are set.

To add a new deduction, first navigate to
`Payroll app --> Contracts --> Salary
Attachments`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Next, click
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a new salary attachment
form loads.

# Payslips

Payslips are created either by the employees themselves or their
managers, and are approved by authorized employees (typically managers).
Then, once payslips are approved, employees are issued payslips and are
paid either by check or direct deposit, depending on how their employee
profile is configured.

The `Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down header of
the `Payroll`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} application
consists of three sections: `To Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`All Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Batches`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

These three sections provide all the tools needed to create payslips for
employees, including individual payslips, a batch of payslips, or
commission payslips.

![Payslips menu selection in Payroll.](payslips/payslips.png){.align-center}

## To pay

Click on `Payroll app --> Payslips --> To Pay`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to see the payslips that need to be paid. On this
page, Odoo displays the payslips that have not been generated yet, and
can be created from this dashboard.

![View all payslips that need to be paid on the Payslips To Pay page.](payslips/all-pay-slips.png){.align-center}

Each payslip will list the `Reference`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} number for the individual payslip, the
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} name,
`Batch Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `To`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} date range, the `Company`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, the `Basic Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Net Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the payslip.

Clicking on an individual payslip entry will show the details for the
individual payslip.

### Create new payslip {#payroll/new-payslip}

A new payslip can be created from the
`Payslips To Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page (`Payroll app
--> Payslips --> To Pay`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}) or the
`Employee Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page
(`Payroll app
--> Payslips --> All Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}),
by clicking the `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in
the top-left corner.

Clicking `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} reveals a blank
payslip form, wherein the necessary payslip information can be entered.

#### Required fields

On the blank payslip form, a number of fields are required to be filled
in with the necessary information. These required fields are represented
by **bold** lines.

![The necessary fields for a new payslip.](payslips/new-payslip.png){.align-center}

- `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Type in the name of an
  employee, or select the desired employee from the drop-down list. Upon
  selecting an employee, several other fields on the payslip form may
  auto-populate. Typically, after making a selection in the
  `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, Odoo
  auto-populates the `Contract`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Payslip Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields, but **only**
  if that information is already on that employee\'s form in the
  *Employees* app.
- `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Click the default date to
  reveal a pop-up calendar. On this calendar, use the
  `< (less-than)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `> (greater than)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icons to select
  the desired month, and click on the desired day to select that
  specific date as the start date for the payslip. Repeat this process
  to add an end date for the payslip in the field below.
- `Contract`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the desired contract for the employee. Only the available
  corresponding contracts for the selected employee appear as options.
- `Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the salary structure type. Only the available
  corresponding structures for the selected contract for that specific
  employee appear as options.
- `Payslip Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: In the blank field,
  type in the name for the payslip. The name should be short and
  descriptive, such as [April 2023]{.title-ref}.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: In the
  `Accounting Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
  select the company the payslip applies to from the
  `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} drop-down menu.
- `Salary Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: In the
  `Accounting Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, enter
  the salary journal in which the payment will be reflected, and found
  in the *Accounting* application.

![The necessary fields for a new payslip in the Accounting Information tab.](payslips/new-payslip-tab.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title

:::

It is recommended to check with the accounting department to ensure
every entry that affects the *Accounting* application is correct.
::::

#### Optional fields

- `Reference`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Any note or reference
  message for the new entry can be entered here.
- `Company Car`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If applicable,
  select the company car from the drop-down.
- `Worked Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: In the
  `Worked Days \& Inputs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, the
  entries under `Worked Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  (including the `Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Number of Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Number of Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) are automatically filled
  in, based on what was entered for the `Period`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Contract`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  `Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields of the payslip
  form.
- `Salary Computation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The
  `Salary Computation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab is
  automatically filled in after the `Compute Sheet`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} button is clicked. Doing so displays all the wages,
  deductions, taxes, etc. for the entry.
- `Batch Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Located in the
  `Accounting Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
  select the payslip batch this new payslip should be added to from the
  drop-down menu.
- `Date Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Located in the
  `Accounting Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, enter
  the date on which the payslip should be posted, by clicking on the
  drop-down menu, and navigating to the correct month and year using the
  `< > (less-than/greater-than)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  icons in the calendar pop-up window. Then, click on the desired date.
- `Salary Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field,
  located in the `Accounting Information`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} tab, represents the journal that the payslip will be
  logged in, and is automatically selected when the
  `Contract`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are entered in the
  payslip form.
- `Accounting Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This field,
  located in the `Accounting Information`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} tab, is automatically filled in once the payslip is
  confirmed.

#### Save and process new payslip

When all the necessary information on the payslip is entered, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the data, or click
`Discard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to delete the entry.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Saving the entry is not required in order to compute the sheet, although
it is considered best practice to do so. The
`Compute Sheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button can be clicked
without first saving the payslip. Doing so will save the entry *and*
compute the sheet.
::::

Click the `Compute Sheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
register all the information, and have the
`Salary Computation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab populated.
If any modifications need to be made, click the `Edit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, make the desired changes, then click the
`Recompute Worked Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
have the changes reflected in the `Worked
Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Salary Computation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tabs.

To print the payslip, click the `Print`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. To cancel the payslip, click the
`Cancel Payslip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

Once everything on the payslip form is correct, click the
`Create Draft Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to create
the payslip. The chatter is automatically updated to show the email sent
to the employee, along with a PDF copy of the payslip.

![The new payslip is emailed to the employee and the email appears in the chatter.](payslips/payslip-chatter.png){.align-center}

Next, the payment must be sent to the employee. To do this, click the
`Make Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. Doing so
reveals a pop-up form, in which the desired
`Bank Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} that the payment
should be made against must be selected from a drop-down menu. Then,
click the `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to confirm
the journal, and return to the payslip.

![Click Make Payment to send the payment to the employee.](payslips/make-payment.png){.align-center}

If a payment needs to be cancelled or refunded, click the corresponding
`Refund`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Cancel Payslip`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, located at
the top of the payslip form.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

In order for a payslip to be paid, the employee *must* have a bank
account entered in their contact information. If there is no bank
information, a payslip cannot be paid, and an error will appear when the
`Make Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is clicked.
Banking information can be found in the
`Private Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on the
employee\'s card. Edit the employee card, and add banking information,
if it is missing.

![Banking information can be entered in an employee\'s card.](payslips/banking.png){.align-center}
::::

## All payslips

To view all payslips regardless of status, go to
`Payroll app --> Payslips --> All
Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Here, all payslips
are organized by batch (in a default list view).

Click on the `▶ (arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} next to the
individual batch name to view all the payslips in that particular batch,
along with all the payslip details. The number of payslips in the batch
is written in parenthesis after the batch name. The
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for each individual payslip
appears on the far-right side, indicating if it is in
`Draft Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Waiting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or if it is
`Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note

\- `Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} indicates the payslip is
created, and there is still time to make edits, since the amounts are
not calculated. - [Waiting]{.title-ref} indicates the payslip has been
calculated and the salary details can be found in the *Salary
Computation* tab. - [Done]{.title-ref} indicates the payslip is
calculated and ready to be paid.

`Create a new payslip <payroll/new-payslip>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} section.

To print PDF versions of payslips from the
`Payslips to Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Employee
Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pages, first select the
desired payslips by clicking on the individual checkbox next to each
payslip to be printed. Or, click the box next to

## Batches

To view payslips in batches, navigate to
`Payroll app --> Payslips --> Batches`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} to display all the payslip batches that have been
created. These payslip batches are displayed in a list view, by default.

Each batch displays the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Date From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Date To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dates, whether it was a
`Credit note`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, its
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

select the company these payslips are written against.

When all the information on the payslip batch form is correct, click the
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to save the
information. To delete the entry, click the `Discard`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

To create the payslips for the newly-created batch, click the

generated, an error message appears in the top-right section. This error
box disappears on its own after several seconds, or the
`✖ (x mark)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon can be clicked to
close the alert.

To remedy the issue, make any necessary modifications (e.g. removing any
payslip lines that cannot be processed), then click the
`Generate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button again.

Once the payslips have been successfully generated, the screen returns
to the payslip batch form.

From here, click the `Generate Draft Entry`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to change the payslips\' status from
`Draft`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to `Done`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

Once payslips have been generated, click the
`Make Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to process the
payments. Doing so reveals a pop-up window, in which the proper banking
information must be entered. In this pop-up window, select the
appropriate `Bank Journal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
drop-down menu, and enter the appropriate file name.

When done, click the `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button

# Work entries

The *Work Entries* dashboard, which can be found by going to
`Payroll --> Work
Entries --> Work Entries`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
provides a visual overview of the individual time sheets of every
employee, with each day split into a morning shift and an afternoon
shift.

![Work Entries dashboard view showing all employee\'s work entries.](work_entries/work-entries-overview.png){.align-center}

To change the view so that only the entries for a single day, week, or
month are shown, click on one of the corresponding links for
`Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Week`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, located
at the top of the dashboard.

Use the `⬅️ (left arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`➡️ (right arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icons on the left
and right side of the `Today`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
to adjust the displayed dates. The arrows will adjust the date based on
the type of time selected. For example, if month is selected, the arrows
will move one month with each click of the arrow. If week or day is
selected, the time will move by either a week or a day for each click of
the arrow, respectively.

## Adding a new work entry

If a work entry is missing and needs to be added, such as sick time or
time off, click `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to create a new
work entry. A pop-up will appear, with several fields to fill in.

Enter the `Work Entry Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, such as
[Sick Time]{.title-ref} or any other short description. Select the
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
`Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the respective
drop-down lists.

![Filling in the work entry Create form in Odoo.](work_entries/create.png){.align-center}

Next, enter the date and time for the work entry in the
`From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `To`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-downs. First, select the date by navigating to the
correct month and year using the `⬅️ (left arrow)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `➡️ (right arrow)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icons, then click on the specific day.

Then, select the time by clicking on the `⏰ (clock)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon, and using the `⬆️ (up
arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`⬇️ (down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icons for each
section to enter the hour, minute, and second for the time period.

The `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} will display the hours
based on the `To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} entries.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

Before clicking either `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
or `Save & New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, it is good to double
check the `Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to ensure the time
stated corresponds to the `To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields.

![Hours entered in the Period field.](work_entries/period.png){.align-center}
::::

Once the information is entered, click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to save the entry and close the pop-up, or
`Save & New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the entry and
create another `Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

## Regenerate work entries

After a work entry has been either added or modified, the work entries
need to be regenerated for the affected employee(s). Click on the
`Regenerate Work Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at
the top of the main dashboard, and a pop-up will appear.

Select the `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to regenerate
work entries for from the `drop-down menu`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and adjust the `From`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields so
the correct date range is displayed. Click the
`Regenerate Work Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and
the work entries will be recreated. Once finished, the pop-up will
close.

![Regenerate a work entry for a particular employee.](work_entries/regenerate-details.png){.align-center}

## Conflicts

A conflict appears for any request that has not been approved, such as
sick time or vacation, or if there are any errors on the work entry,
such as required fields being left blank. Conflicts are required to be
resolved before payslips can be generated.

Any work entry that has a conflict to be resolved is indicated on the
main `Work Entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} overview dashboard,
located by going to
`Payroll --> Work Entries --> Conflicts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, where only conflicts needing resolution are
shown.

![Conflicts dashboard view showing all employee\'s conflicts in work entries.](work_entries/conflicts.png){.align-center}

Conflicts are indicated with an orange triangle in the top left corner
of each individual entry. Click on an individual work entry to see the
conflict details in a pop-up.

The conflict is briefly explained in an orange text box.

![Details for a conflict appear in the pop-up.](work_entries/conflict-detail.png){.align-center}

The `Work Entry Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are listed on the
left side of the pop-up. The `From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} date range, as well as the
total time requested (in hours), appear in the
`Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the right side.

If there is a conflict because a time-off request for the same time
already exists in the system, the time-off will be entered in the
`Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Clicking the
`External
Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to the
`Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} entry will bring up the
duplicate time-off request.

The details for the time-off request appear in the pop-up. The request
can be modified if needed. Click either the `Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
to approve or deny the request, then click the `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to save the changes.

![Edit and/or validate a duplicate time-off request.](work_entries/validate.png){.align-center}

Once the duplicate time-off request has been approved and saved, the
screen goes back to the conflict. Click
`Refuse Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Approve Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} via the buttons in
the top right to either approve or deny the request. Repeat for all
conflicts until there are no conflicts to resolve.

After conflicts have been resolved, work entries must be regenerated for
each employee by clicking the
`Regenerate Work Entries`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and
entering the corresponding information for each employee.

![Regenerate Work Entries button on the Work Entries Regeneration form.](work_entries/regenerate-employee.png){.align-center}

## Generating payslips

To generate payslips, navigate to the time period the payslips should be
generated for, either day, week, or month. When the desired pay period
is displayed, click the `Generate Payslips`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

![Generate Payslips button on the Work Entry dashboard.](work_entries/generate-payslips.png){.align-center}

If the `Generate Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is
not active (appears light turquoise instead of dark turquoise), that
indicates there are conflicts. *Solve conflicts first* will appear as a
warning when `Generate Payslips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
moused over. Resolve all conflicts before generating payslips.
::::

A batch entry will appear for the time period selected. The batch name
appears at the top in the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field, typically listing the month and year for the particular batch.

The date range the payslips apply to appears in the
`Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. The company appears
in the `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, along with an
option to mark the payslips as a credit note. To make changes, click the

# Payroll

Odoo *Payroll* is used to process work entries and create payslips for
employees, including both regular pay and commission. Payroll works in
conjunction with other Odoo apps, such as *Employees*, *Timesheets*,
*Time Off*, and *Attendances*.

The *Payroll* app helps ensure there are no issues or conflicts when
validating work entries, handles country-specific localizations to
ensure that payslips follow local rules and taxes, and allows for salary
assignments. Payroll configuration is critical to ensure accurate and
timely processing of payslips.

## Settings

To access the *Settings*, go to
`Payroll --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Whether or not payslips are posted in accounting,
and whether SEPA payments are created, is selected here.

The `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} screen is where
localization settings are configured. *Localizations* are
country-specific settings pre-configured in Odoo at the creation of the
database, and account for all taxes, fees, and allowances for that
particular country. The `Localization`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section of the `Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} includes a detailed view of all benefits provided to
employees.

![Settings available for Payroll.](payroll/payroll-settings.png){.align-center}

Any country-specific localizations are set up in the
`Localization`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
`Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} screen. All localization
items are pre-populated when the country is specified during the
creation of the database. It is not recommended to alter the
localization settings unless specifically required.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Odoo can handle a multi-company configuration. This is generally done
when there is a main company or office location, such as a headquarters,
and there are other offices/branches around the country or globe, that
fall under that main company or headquarters. In Odoo, each company,
including the headquarters, would be setup as their own company/branch
using the multi-company method.

Each individual company can have a different localization setting
configured for that specific company, since company locations can vary
and be located anywhere in the world, where rules and laws differ. For
more information on companies refer to `this documentation
<../general/companies>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} on setting up
companies.
::::

## Work entries {#payroll/work-entries-config}

A *work entry* is an individual record on an employee\'s timesheet. Work
entries can be configured to account for all types of work and time off,
such as `Attendance`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Sick Time
Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Training`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Public Holiday`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

::: seealso
`Manage work entries <payroll/work_entries>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}
:::

### Work entry types

When creating a work entry in the *Payroll* application, or when an
employee enters information in the *Timesheets* application, a
`Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} needs to be
selected. The list of `Work Entry Types`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is automatically created based on localization settings
set in the database.

To view the current work entry types available, go to
`Payroll --> Configuration -->
Work Entries --> Work Entry Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Each work entry type has a code to aid in the creation of payslips, and
to ensure all taxes and fees are correctly entered.

![List of all work entry types currently available for use, with the payroll code and color.](payroll/work-entry-types.png){.align-center}

#### New work entry type

To create a new `Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
click the `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and enter the
information for the following sections on the form.

##### General information section

- `Work Entry Type Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The name
  should be short and descriptive, such as [Sick Time]{.title-ref} or
  [Public Holiday]{.title-ref}.
- `Payroll Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This code appears
  with the work entry type on timesheets and payslips. Since the code is
  used in conjunction with the *Accounting* application, it is advised
  to check with the accounting department for a code to use.
- `DMFA code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This code is used to
  identify `DMFA (De Multifunctionele Aangifte)`{.interpreted-text
  role="abbr"} entries on a corresponding DMFA report. The DMFA report
  is a quarterly report that Belgian-based companies are required to
  submit for social security reporting purposes. This report states the
  work done by the employees during the quarter, as well as the salaries
  paid to those employees.
- `External Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This code is used
  for exporting data to a third-party payroll service. Check with the
  third-party being used in order to determine the
  `External Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to enter for the
  new work entry type.
- `SDWorx code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This code is only
  for companies that use SDWorx, a payroll service provider.
- `Color`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select a color for the
  particular work entry type.

##### Display in payslip section

- `Rounding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The rounding method
  selected determines how quantities on timesheet entries are displayed
  on the payslip.
  - `No Rounding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A timesheet entry
    is not modified.
  - `Half Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A timesheet entry is
    rounded to the closest half day amount.
  - `Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: A timesheet entry is
    rounded to the closest full day amount.

::: example
If the working time is set to an 8-hour work day (40-hour work week),
and an employee enters a time of 5.5 hours on a timesheet, and
`Rounding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
`No Rounding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the entry remains 5.5
hours. If `Rounding`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to
`Half Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the entry is changed to 4
hours. If it is set to `Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, it is
changed to 8 hours.
:::

##### Unpaid section

- `Unpaid in Structures Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If
  the work entry is for work that is not paid, specify which pay
  structure the unpaid work entry applies to from the drop-down menu.
  Some situations where work would be logged on a timesheet but no
  compensation given would be for unpaid internships, unpaid training,
  or volunteer work.

##### Valid for advantages section

- `Meal Voucher`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the work entry
  should count towards a meal voucher, check the box.
- `Representation Fees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the work
  entry should count towards representation fees, check the box.
- `Private Car Reimbursement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the
  work entry should count towards a private car reimbursement, check the
  box.

##### Time off options section

- `Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Check this box if the
  work entry type can be selected for a time off request or entry in the
  *Time Off* application. If `Time Off`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} is checked, a `Time Off
  Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears. This field has
  a drop-down menu to select the specific type of time off, such as
  [Paid Time Off]{.title-ref}, [Sick Time Off]{.title-ref}, or [Extra
  Hours]{.title-ref} for example. A new type of time off can be entered
  in the field if the listed types of time off in the drop-down menu do
  not display the type of time off needed.
- `Keep Time Off Right`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This is for
  Belgian-specific companies only, and will not appear for other
  localizations. Check this box if the work entry is for time off that
  will affect the time off benefits for the following year. Workers are
  given time off each year according to the government, and in some
  cases, time-off taken during a specific time period can affect how
  much time off the employee will receive or accrue the following year.

##### Reporting section

- `Unforeseen Absence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: If the work
  entry should be visible on the unforeseen absences report, check this
  box.

![New work entry type form with all fields to be filled in.](payroll/new-work-entry.png){.align-center}

### Working schedules {#payroll/working-times}

To view the currently configured working schedules, go to
`Payroll --> Configuration
--> Work Entries --> Working Schedules`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. The working schedules that are available for an
employee\'s contracts and work entries are found in this list.

Working schedules are company-specific. Each company must identify each
type of working schedule they use.

::: example
An Odoo database containing multiple companies that use a standard
40-hour work week needs to have a separate working schedule entry for
each company that uses the 40-hour standard work week.

A database with five companies that all use a standard 40-hour work week
needs to have five separate 40-hour working schedules configured.
:::

![All working schedules available to use currently set up in the database for the company.](payroll/working-schedules.png){.align-center}

#### New working schedule

To create a new working schedule, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, and enter the information on the form.

The fields are auto-populated for a regular 40-hour work week but can be
modified. First, change the name of the working time by modifying the
text in the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Next, make
any adjustments to the days and times that apply to the new working
time.

In the `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, modify
the `Day of Week`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Day Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} selections by
clicking on the drop-down menus in each column and making the desired
selection. The `Work From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Work To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} columns are modified by
typing in the time.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Work From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Work To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} times must be in a 24-hour
format. For example, [2:00 PM]{.title-ref} would be entered as
[14:00]{.title-ref}.
::::

If the working time should be in a two-week configuration, click the
`Switch to 2 weeks
calendar`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the top left.
This creates entries for an `Even week`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and an `Odd week`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![New working schedule form.](payroll/new-working-schedule.png){.align-center}

## Salary

### Structure types {#payroll/structure-types}

In Odoo, an employee\'s payslip is based on *structures* and *structure
types*, which both affect how an employee enters timesheets. Each
structure type is an individual set of rules for processing a timesheet
entry, which consists of different structures nested within it.
Structure types define how often an employee gets paid, the working
hours, and if wages are based on a salary (fixed) or how many hours the
employee worked (varied).

For example, a structure type could be [Employee]{.title-ref}, and that
structure type could have two different structures in it: a [Regular
Pay]{.title-ref} structure which includes all the separate rules for
processing regular pay, as well as a structure for an [End of Year
Bonus]{.title-ref} which includes the rules only for the end of year
bonus. Both the [Regular Pay]{.title-ref} structure and [End of Year
Bonus]{.title-ref} structure are structures within the
[Employee]{.title-ref} structure type.

The different structure types can be seen by going to
`Payroll --> Configuration -->
Salary --> Structure Types`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

There are two default structure types configured in Odoo: *Employee* and
*Worker*. Typically, *Employee* is used for salaried employees, which is
why the wage type is *Monthly Fixed Wage*, and *Worker* is typically
used for employees paid by the hour, so the wage type is *Hourly Wage*.

![List of all currently configured structure types available to use.](payroll/structure-type.png){.align-center}

### New structure type

To make a new structure type, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button and a structure type form appears. Enter the
information in the fields. Most fields are pre-populated, but all the
fields can be modified.

- `Structure Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the name
  for the new structure type, such as \'Employee\' or \'Worker\'.
- `Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the country that
  the new structure type applies to from the drop-down menu.
- `Wage Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select what type of
  wage the new structure type will use, either
  `Monthly Fixed Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Hourly Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If the wage type is
  going to be used for salaried employees who receive the same wage
  every pay period, select `Monthly Fixed
  Wage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If the wage type is going to
  be used for employees who receive wages based on how many hours they
  worked during a pay period, select `Hourly Wage`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}.
- `Default Scheduled Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  typical pay schedule for the new structure type from the drop-down
  menu. Options are `Monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Quarterly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Semi-annually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Annually`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Weekly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Bi-weekly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Bi-monthly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This indicates how
  often this type of structure type is paid out.
- `Default Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  default working hours for the new structure type from the drop-down
  menu. All available working hours for the currently selected company
  appear in the drop-down menu. The default working hours that are
  pre-configured in Odoo is the
  `Standard 40 hours/week`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. If
  the needed working hours do not appear in the list, a
  `new set of default working hours can be created <new-default-working-hours>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- `Regular Pay Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Type in
  the name for the regular pay structure.
- `Default Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
  the default type of work entry the new structure type will fall under
  from the drop-down menu. Options include

#### New default working hours

To make new default working hours, type the name for the new working
hours in the `Default
Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field on the new
structure type form. Click `Create and edit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. A default working hours form will pop up. The default
working hours form has two sections, a general information section and a
tab listing out all the individual working hours by day and time. When
the form is filled out, click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Type in the name for the
  new default working hours. This should be descriptive and clear to
  understand, such as [Standard 20 Hours/Week]{.title-ref}.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the company that
  can use these new default working hours from the drop-down menu. Keep
  in mind, working hours are company-specific and cannot be shard
  between companies. Each company needs to have their own working hours
  set.

- `Average Hour Per Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The average
  hours per day field will be auto-populated based on the working hours
  configured in the *Working Hours* tab. This entry affects resource
  planning, since the average daily hours affect what resources can be
  used, and in what quantity, per work day.

- `Timezone`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the timezone
  that the new default working hours will be used for from the drop-down
  menu.

- `Company Full Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the
  number of hours per week an employee would need to work in order to be
  considered a full-time employee. Typically, this is approximately 40
  hours, and this number affects what types of benefits an employee can
  receive based on their employment status (full-time vs part-time).

- `Work Time rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: This percentage
  is auto-generated based on the entry for the
  `Company Full Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the working
  hours configured in the *Working Hours* tab. This number should be
  between [0.00%]{.title-ref} and [100%]{.title-ref}, so if the
  percentage is above [100%]{.title-ref}, it is an indication that the
  working times and/or `Company Full Time`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} hours need adjustment.

- `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} Tab: This tab is
  where each day\'s specific working hours are listed. When a new
  default working hour form is created, the working hours tab is
  pre-populated with a default 40-hour week, with each day divided into
  three timed sections. Every day has morning (8:00-12:00), lunch
  (12:00-13:00), and evening (13:00-17:00) hours configured using a 24
  hour time format. To adjust any of these hours, click on the specific
  field to adjust, and make the adjustment using the drop-down menus, or
  in the specific case of the times, type in the desired time.

  :::: note
  ::: title
  Note
  :::

  If the working hours are not consistent each week, and the hours are
  on a bi-weekly schedule instead, click the
  `Switch to 2 week calendar`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button
  at the top of the new default working hours form. This will change the
  working hours tab to display two weeks of working times that can be
  adjusted.
  ::::

### Structures

*Salary structures* are the different ways an employee gets paid within
a specific *structure*, and are specifically defined by various rules.

The amount of structures a company needs for each structure type depends
on how many different ways employees are paid, and how their pay is
calculated. For example, a common structure that could be useful to add
may be a [Bonus]{.title-ref}.

To view all the various structures for each structure type, go to
`Payroll -->
Configuration --> Salary --> Structures`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Each `structure type <payroll/structure-types>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} lists the various structures associated with it. Each
structure contains a set of rules that define it.

![All available salary structures.](payroll/salary-structure.png){.align-center}

Click on a structure to view its `Salary Rules`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. These rules are what calculate the payslip for the
employee.

![Salary structure details for Regular Pay, listing all the specific Salary Rules.](payroll/structure-regular-pay-rules.png){.align-center}

### Rules

Each structure has a set of *salary rules* to follow for accounting
purposes. These rules are configured by the localization, and affect
actions in the *Accounting* application, so modifications to the default
rules, or the creation of new rules, should only be done when necessary.

To view all the rules, go to
`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Salary --> Rules`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click on a structure (such as
`Regular Pay`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) to view all the rules.

To make a new rule, click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. A
new rule form appears. Enter the information in the fields.

The required fields for a rule are:

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a name for the rule.
- `Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select a category the
  rule applies to from the drop-down menu, or enter a new one.
- `Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter a code to be used for
  this new rule. It is recommended to coordinate with the accounting
  department for a code to use as this will affect accounting reports
  and payroll processing.
- `Salary Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select a salary
  structure the rule applies to from the drop-down menu, or enter a new
  one.
- `Condition Based on`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: In the
  `General`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, select from the
  drop-down menu whether the rule is `Always True`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} (always applies), a `Range`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} (applies to a specific range, which is entered
  beneath the selection), or a `Python Expression`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} (the code is entered beneath the selection).
- `Amount Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: In the
  `General`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, select from the
  drop-down menu whether the amount is a
  `Fixed Amount`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
  `Percentage (%)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or a `Python
  Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Depending on what is
  selected, the fixed amount, percentage, or Python code needs to be
  entered next.

![Enter the information for the new rule on the new rule form.](payroll/new-rule.png){.align-center}

### Rule parameters

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Currently, the `Rule Parameters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
feature found inside the `Payroll app
--> Configuration --> Salary --> Rule Parameters`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} menu is still in development and only serves a
specific use case for Belgian markets. The documentation will be updated
when this section has matured to more markets.
::::

### Other input types

When creating payslips, it is sometimes necessary to add other entries
for specific circumstances, like expenses, reimbursements, or
deductions. These other inputs can be configured by going to
`Payroll --> Configuration --> Salary --> Other Input Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![A list of other input types for payroll that can be selected when creating a new entry for
a payslip.](payroll/other-input.png){.align-center}

To create a new input type, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. Enter the `Description`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, the `Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
which structure it applies to in the
`Availability in Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The `Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is used in the salary
rules to compute payslips. If the
`Availability in Structure`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
left blank, it indicates that the new input type is available for all
payslips and is not exclusive to a specific structure.
::::

![Create a new Input Type.](payroll/input-type-new.png){.align-center}

## Salary package configurator

The various options under the
`Salary Package Configurator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section
of the
`Payroll --> Configuration --> Salary Package Configurator`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} menu all affect an employee\'s potential salary.
These sections (`Advantages`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Personal Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Resume`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Offers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) specify what benefits can
be offered to an employee in their salary package.

Depending on what information an employee enters (such as deductions,
dependents, etc.), their salary is adjusted accordingly. When an
applicant applies for a job on the company website, the sections under
`Salary Package Configurator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
directly affect what the applicant sees, and what is populated as the
applicant enters information.

### Advantages

When offering potential employees a position, there can be certain
*advantages* or benefits set in Odoo in addition to the salary to make
an offer more appealing (such as extra time off, the use of a company
car, reimbursement for a phone or internet, etc.).

To see the advantages, go to
`Payroll --> Configuration --> Salary Package
Configurator --> Advantages`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Advantages are grouped by `Structure type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and the advantage listed for a particular structure
type is only available for that specific structure.

![A list view of all the advantages or benefits that is available for each structure type.](payroll/advantages.png){.align-center}

::: example
A company has two structure types, one labeled
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and anther labeled
`Intern`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} structure type contains an
advantage of using a company car, while the `Intern`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} structure type does not. Instead, the
`Intern`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} structure type has a meal
voucher advantage available, while the `Employee`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} structure type does not.

A person hired under the `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
structure type can use a company car, but cannot have meal vouchers. The
opposite is true for someone hired under the `Intern`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} structure type. They would have meal vouchers available
to them, not the use of a company car.
:::

To make a new advantage, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, and enter the information in the fields. The
required fields for an advantage are:

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the name for the
  advantage.
- `Advantage Field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select from the
  drop-down menu what field in the payslip this advantage appears under.
- `Advantage Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select from the
  drop-down menu what type of advantage the benefit is. Select from
  `Monthly Benefit in Kind`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Monthly Advantages in Net`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Monthly Advantages in Cash`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Yearly Advantages in Cash`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Salary Structure Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select
  from the drop-down menu which salary structure type this advantage
  applies to.
- `Display Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select from the
  drop-down menu how this advantage is displayed.

![List of advantages employee\'s can have.](payroll/new-advantage.png){.align-center}

### Personal info

Every employee in Odoo has an *employee card* which is created when a
candidate becomes an employee. This card includes all of their personal
information, resume, work information, and documents.

The personal information is gathered from the salary package
configurator section that a candidate fills out after being offered a
position. This personal information is then transferred to the employee
card when they are hired.

To view an employee\'s card, go to the main
`Employees`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app dashboard, and
click on the employee\'s card.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

An employee card can be thought of as an employee personnel file.
::::

The *Personal Information* section lists all of the fields that are
available to enter on the employee\'s card. To access this section, go
to `Payroll --> Configuration --> Salary
Package Configurator  --> Personal Info`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

![A list of all the personal information that appears on employee card to enter.](payroll/personal-info.png){.align-center}

To edit a personal info entry, select the entry from the list, and
modify the personal info. To create a new personal info entry, click the
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

The required fields, aside from entering the
`Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} name, are `Related
Model`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Related Field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Select a
`Related Model`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down
menu. `Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} populates the field
by default, but the `Bank
Account`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option is also available if
the information is related to a bank account instead. Select a
`Related Field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down
menu that best describes what kind of personal information this entry
is, and where it is going to be stored in the backed. Then, select a
`Category`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu
that the personal information should be under, such as
`Address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Personal Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The two most important fields on the personal info form are
`Is Required`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Display Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Checking the
`Is Required`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box makes the field
mandatory on the employee\'s card. The `Display Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu allows for the information to be entered
in a variety of ways, from a `Text`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
box, to a customizable `Radio`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button, a `Checkbox`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
`Document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and more.

![New personal information entry.](payroll/personal-new.png){.align-center}

### Resume

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Currently, the `Resume`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature found
inside the `Payroll app -->
Configuration --> Salary Package Configurator --> Resume`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} menu is still in development and only serves a
specific use case for Belgian markets. The documentation will be updated
when this section has matured to more markets.
::::

### Offers

When a candidate is offered a position, there are several items that
need to be tracked in order for a business to stay organized, such as
where in the offer process the candidate is, how long the offer is valid
for, as well as all the offer details. These details are all stored in
each *offers* record.

To view all offers, go to
`Payroll --> Configuration --> Salary Package Configurator
--> Offers`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. All offers that
have been sent to either potential candidates or current employees
appears in this list. The status, offer start date and expiration date,
amount of the contract, and more, can all be found in this list. Offers
sent via the `Recruitment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
application appear here, but there is an option to create a new offer
from the `Payroll`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} application as
well.

![A list of all offers given to a current employee or potential candidate along with the
status of the offer.](payroll/offers.png){.align-center}

To create a new offer, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button. The two required fields are the
`Contract Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Select the
`Contract Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menus.
Fill in any other details for the offer, such as the
`Job Title`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Contract Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
`Offer Validity Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

role="guilabel"} to edit the details.

![Edit the job position card.](new_job/edit-job.png){.align-center}

Enter the job description in the `Job Summary`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. This information is what is visible to potential
applicants when searching for available jobs.

#### Recruitment

All the basic information about the job position is listed under the
`Recruitment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. None of the fields
are required, but it is a good idea to provide at least a few details,
such as where the job is located.

The fields can be filled out as follows:

- `Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the relevant
  department for the job position.
- `Job Location`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the physical
  address for the job.

  `Interview form <interview>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} that
  applicants will fill out prior to their interview.
- `Contract Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select a
  contract template that will be used when offering the job to a
  candidate.
- `Process Details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section: this
  section contains information that is displayed online for the job
  position. This informs the applicants of the timeline and steps for
  the recruitment process, so they know when to expect a reply.
  - `Time to Answer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the
    number of days before the applicant is contacted.
  - `Process`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the various
    stages the candidate will go through during the recruitment process.
  - `Days to get an Offer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the
    number of days before the applicant should expect an offer after the
    recruitment process has ended.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Process Details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section is a
text field. All answers are typed in rather than selected from a
drop-down menu. The text is displayed on the website exactly as it
appears in this tab.
::::

![Enter job information details in the recruitment tab.](new_job/recruitment-tab.png){.align-center}

### Create interview form {#interview}

An *Interview Form* is used to determine if a candidate is a good fit
for a job position. Interview forms can be as specific or general as
desired, and can take the form of a certification, an exam, or a general
questionnaire. Interview forms are determined by the recruitment team.

All interview forms must be created, there are no pre-configured forms
in Odoo. To create an interview form, start from the recruitment tab of
the `Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form. In the
`Interview Form`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, enter a name
for the new interview form. As the name is typed, several options
populate beneath the entry,
`Create (interview form name)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`View all`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click
`Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. and a
`Create Interview Form`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The option `View all`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} only appears if
there are any interview forms already created. If no interview forms
exist, the only options available are `Create (interview form
name)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
::::

First, enter a name for the form in the `Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. This should be indicative of when the form
should be used. For example, is the form specific to a job position, or
is it a general form that can be used for all recruitment scenarios?

Next, select what kind of interview form is being created. The default
is `Custom`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which is pre-selected.
The various options are `Survey`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Live session`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Assessment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Custom`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Appraisal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then select the person responsible for the form from the drop-down menu
for the `Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

If desired, an image can be added to the interview form. Mouse over the
camera icon on the far right and a `✏️ (pencil)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon appears. Click the `✏️ (pencil)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon and a file explorer window appears. Navigate to
the desired image file, then click `Open`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to select it.

![The top portion of the new interview form with everything filled out and selected.](new_job/create-interview-form.png){.align-center}

#### Questions

In the `Questions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click on
`Add a section`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add a section to
the form. A line appears, and a section heading can be entered. When
complete, click off the line, or press enter to lock in the new section
on the form.

Next, click `Add a question`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to add a
question to the section. A `Create
Sections and Questions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears where the question details are entered. Type out the question in
the top line.

There are several `Question Types`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
choose from:

- `Multiple choice: only one answer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  a multiple choice question that only allows the candidate to select
  one answer
- `Multiple choice: multiple answers allowed`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: a multiple choice question that allows the candidate
  to select multiple answers
- `Multiple Lines Text Box`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: allows
  the applicant to enter several lines of text
- `Single Line Text Box`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: limits the
  applicant to only a single line of text
- `Numerical Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: only allows a
  number to be entered
- `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a calendar module is
  presented to select a date
- `Datetime`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a calendar module and a
  clock icon is presented to select a date and time
- `Matrix`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a customizable table that
  allows the candidate to choose an answer for each row

After selecting a question type, a sample question appears in gray. This
represents how the question will be displayed to applicants.

![Add a new question to the interview form.](new_job/questions.png){.align-center}

Questions and sections can be reorganized. Move them by clicking and
dragging individual section headings or question lines to their desired
position(s).

Sections are indicated by a gray background, while questions have a
white background.

![A sample of categories and questions for a candidate.](new_job/questions-matrix.png){.align-center}

##### Answers

If `Multiple choice: only one answer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Multiple choice: multiple answers
allowed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Single Line Text Box`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Matrix`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected for the
`Question Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, an
`Answers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab appears beneath the
question. If another question type is selected, the
`Answers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab remains hidden from
view.

:::::: tabs
::: tab
Multiple choice

For both the `Multiple choice: only one answer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Multiple choice:
multiple answers allowed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} question
type, the answers are populated in the same way.

First, in the `Answers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. A line appears, and an
answer can be entered. After typing in the answer, click off the line,
or press enter to lock in the new answer on the form and have another
answer line appear.

If desired, an image can be attached to the answer. Click on a line to
select it, and an `Upload your file`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button appears on the right side. Click the `Upload
your file`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and a file explorer
window appears. Navigate to the image file, select it, then click
`Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to select it.

Repeat this for all the answers to be added for the multiple choice
question. The answers can be rearranged in any order. To move an answer,
click on the six small squares on the far left of each answer line, and
drag the answer to the desired position. The order the answers appear in
the form is the order the answers will appear online.

To delete a line, click on the `🗑️ (trash can)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon on the far right side of the answer line.

::: tab
Single Line Text Box

If the `Single Line Text Box`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
question type is selected, only two checkboxes appear in the
`Answers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab:

- `Input must be an email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: activate
  this option if the answer must be in the format of an email address.
  - `Save as user email?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this
    option appears if `Input must be an email`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} is selected. This saves the email entered on the
    form as the user\'s email, and will be used anytime Odoo contacts
    the user via email.
- `Save as user nickname?`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: activate
  this option to populate the answer as the user\'s nickname. This is
  stored and used anywhere Odoo uses a nickname.

![The three possible checkboxes that can appear if a single line of text is selected
for the question type.](new_job/single-line.png){.align-center}
:::

::: tab
Matrix

Sometimes, a question is asked that does not fit a standard answer
format, and is best suited for a matrix. For example, asking an
applicant what is their availability to work compared to the various
shifts is a perfect question for a matrix format. In this example, an
applicant can click on all the shifts they are available to work.

For a `Matrix`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} question type, there
are two sets of data that need to be input. The rows and columns must
both be configured. The columns are represented by the
`Choices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, while the rows are
configured in the `Rows`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

The method for populating both sections is the same. In the
`Answers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in either the
`Choices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Row`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section. A line appears, and an answer can be entered.
After typing in the answer, click off the line, or press enter to lock
in the new answer on the form and have another answer line appear.
Repeat this for all answers for both the `Choices`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Rows`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sections.

  allowed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a
  `Show Comments Field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option
  appears. Activate the option to allow the applicant to answer the
  question by typing in an answer (or comment). A `Comment
  Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Comment is an answer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appear
  if activated. Enter the text to appear in the
  `Comment Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. This
  should be helpful to the applicant, such as [If other, please
  specify]{.title-ref}. Last, if the comment should be logged as the
  applicant\'s answer, activate the box.
- `Multiple Lines Text Box`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a
  `Placeholder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears. Enter
  any text that should appear with the question to help clarify how the
  applicant should answer.
- `Single Line Text Box`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Numerical Value`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a
  `Validate entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option appears.
  Activate this option if what the applicant enters must be a numerical
  value, *and* needs to be verified. The answer can *only* be verified
  if it is a numerical entry. When activated, several other options
  appear. Enter the values for the `Min/Max Limits`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} in the two fields. Next, enter the text that appears
  when the answer given does not fit within the designated minimum and
  maximum parameters. Last, enter any text in the
  `Placeholder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to provide any
  additional information or directions to assist the applicant.
- `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Datetime`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: a
  `Validate entry`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option appears.
  Activate this option if the applicant\'s answer needs to be verified.
  When activated, several other options appear. Enter the date ranges
  for the `Min/Max Limits`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the two
  fields. Click on a field, either the `minimum`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} or `maximum`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
  a calendar appears. Select the dates for the corresponding fields.
  Next, enter the text that appears when the answer given does not fit
  within the designated minimum and maximum dates. Last, enter any text
  in the `Placeholder`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
  provide any additional information or directions to assist the
  applicant.
- `Matrix`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the first option that
  appears is `Matrix Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Select
  either `One choice per row`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Multiple choices per row`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} using
  the drop-down menu. The next option is
  `Show Comments Field`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Activate the
  option if there should be a comment displayed to the applicant. If
  activated, a `Comment Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
  `Comment is an answer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
  appear. Enter the text to appear in the `Comment
  Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. This should be an
  instruction helpful to the applicant, such as [If other, please
  specify]{.title-ref}. Last, if the comment should be logged as the
  applicant\'s answer, activate the box.

###### Constraints

If the question is required to be answered by the applicant, activate
the box next to `Mandatory Answer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
An `Error message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears,
with some example text in gray (*This question requires an answer*).
Enter the message that should appear if the applicant attempts to move
on to the next question without answering this required one. The text
should explain that the question must be answered.

###### Layout

If the question should only appear if a previous question is answered in
a specific way, activate the `Conditional Display`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} option. A new `Triggering Question`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field appears. Using the drop-down menu, select the
previous question this new question is linked to. Once a previous
question is selected, a `Triggering Answer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field appears. Select the answer that must be selected
in order for the new question to appear.

::: example
To further illustrate a triggering question, the following is an example
that is applicable to recruitment. The question, [Do you have experience
with managing a sales team?]{.title-ref} is already added. A new
question is then added, [How many years of experience?]{.title-ref}.
This question should *only* appear if the applicant selected
[Yes]{.title-ref} to the question [Do you have prior experience managing
a sales team?]{.title-ref}.

To properly configure this example, activate the
`Conditional Display`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. Then,
select [Do you have experience with managing a sales team?]{.title-ref}
as the `Triggering
Question`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, select
`Yes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for the triggering answer.

# Recruitment

Odoo keeps all job applicants organized with a pre-configured series of
steps and stages that each applicant goes through. Each stage has a
specific step(s) that should be performed. These range from scheduling a
phone call, conducting an interview, to sending a job offer, just to
name a few. This process is referred to as the \'applicant flow\'.

When an applicant applies for a job position, an *applicant card* is
automatically created in Odoo\'s *Recruitment* app for that specific job
position. As the applicant progresses through the recruitment pipeline,
the recruitment team moves their card from one stage to the next.

`Stages can be configured <recruitment/modify-stages>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} so that an email is automatically sent out using a set,
pre-configured template as soon as an applicant\'s card enters a stage.
These automated emails are defined on each stage in the applicant flow.

The applicant flow explained in this document is the default flow in
Odoo, and goes through the applicant flow when using the *Recruitment*
application\'s default configuration. The applicant flow is able to be
modified to suit the specific recruitment flow for any business.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The applicant flow with all its stages are universal and applies to all
job positions, unless specified.
`A specific stage can be configured <recruitment/customize-stages>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to be job-specific, meaning that specific stage is only
visible for that specific job position. Otherwise, if a new stage is
created, or an existing stage is modified, those changes will be visible
on all job positions.
::::

## Kanban view

To access the kanban view for a job position, navigate to the main
`Recruitment app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} dashboard,
which is the default view when opening the application. All job
positions appear on the main dashboard. Click the
`New Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button on a
job position card to navigate to the kanban view for all the applicants
for that particular job position.

![Main dashboard view of job position card, showing new applications button.](recruitment/new-applicants-button.png){.align-center}

Inside the job application, the kanban stages appear, with all the
applicants populated in their respective columns, indicating what stage
they are currently in. There are five default stages in Odoo:

- `Initial Qualification <recruitment/initial-qualification>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `First Interview <recruitment/first-interview>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Second Interview <recruitment/second-interview>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Contract Proposal <recruitment/contract-proposal>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
- `Contract Signed <recruitment/contract-signed>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}

The last column, `Contract Signed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
is folded by default, meaning that the column appears in gray and the
applicants in it are hidden from view. To expand the folded stage and
view the applicant cards for that column, click anywhere on the thin
gray column that says the stage name and the column expands, revealing
the applicants.

![Expand a folded column by clicking on it in the kanban view.](recruitment/stages.png){.align-center}

Each stage has a color-coded bar beneath the stage name, giving
information about the applicant\'s status in the stage. The colors are:

- `Green`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: there are applicants in
  the stage with an activity that is either already scheduled or needs
  to be scheduled in the future (such as a phone call or interview),
  according to the parameters for that particular stage.
- `Yellow`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: there are applicants in
  the stage with an activity either scheduled for today or due to be
  scheduled today.
- `Red`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: there are applicants in the
  stage with overdue activities which need to be scheduled.
- `Gray`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: there are either no
  activities currently scheduled and no future activities that are
  required to be scheduled, or there are no applicants currently in the
  stage.

## Customize stages {#recruitment/customize-stages}

Stages can be modified, added, or deleted to best meet the needs of the
particular hiring steps of a business.

### New stage

To create a new stage, click on `+ Add a Column`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and a new column appears. Enter the title for the new
stage in the `Column title`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field,
then click `Add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The new column
appears, and another new stage is available to create. If no new stages
are needed, click anywhere on the screen to exit the new column
creation.

![The plus sign to click in order to add a new column to the kanban stages.](recruitment/add-column.png){.align-center}

### Modify stage {#recruitment/modify-stages}

To modify the settings of a stage, hover over the name of the stage, and
a `⚙️ (gear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon appears in the
upper right hand side of the stage. Click on the
`⚙️ (gear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and a menu appears.
Then click on the `Edit Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option. An `Edit Column`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form
appears. Make any modifications to the form, then click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} when done.

![The gear icon that appears when a column name is moused over, and the drop-down menu it
displays when clicked.](recruitment/gear.png){.align-center}

#### Edit column form

The `Edit Column`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} form is where the
stage\'s settings are configured. The only required fields are the
`Stage Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Tooltips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

The fields to be populated or modified are:

- `Stage Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: type in a name for
  the stage.
- `Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select an email
  template to be used from the drop-down menu. If a template is
  selected, when the applicant card enters the stage, an email will
  automatically be sent to the applicant using the selected template.
- `Folded in Kanban`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: check the box
  to have the stage appear folded (hidden) at all times in the default
  view.
- `Hired Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: check the box if
  this stage indicates that the applicant is hired. When an applicant\'s
  card enters this stage, the card displays a `Hired`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} banner in the upper right corner. If this box is
  checked, this stage is used to determine the hire date of an
  applicant.
- `Job Specific`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the stage only
  applies to a specific job position(s), select the job position(s) from
  the drop-down menu. Multiple job positions can be selected.
- `Show in Referrals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: check the box
  if this stage should be seen in the *Referrals* application, and allow
  the referrer to accrue points when a referral of theirs reaches this
  stage. If this is active, a `Points`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field appears. Enter the amount of referral points
  the employee receives when an applicant enters this stage.
- `Tooltips`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section: there are three
  pre-configured labels (colored circles) for each applicant\'s card,
  indicating its status. These colors are displayed at the top of each
  stage to reflect the statuses of the applicants in the stage. The
  *names* for the label can be modified, but the label itself (the
  color) cannot. The default names and labels are:
  `In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (gray),
  `Blocked`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (red), and
  `Ready for Next Stage`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (green).
- `Requirements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter any internal
  notes for this stage explaining any requirements of the stage.

### Delete stage

If a stage is no longer needed, the stage can be deleted. To delete a
stage, hover over the name of the stage, and a
`⚙️ (gear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon appears. First,
click on the `⚙️ (gear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to
reveal a drop-down menu, then click `Delete`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. A pop-up warning appears, asking
`Are you sure you want to remove this column?`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Click `OK`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
delete the column.

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

If there are applicants currently in the stage being deleted, an error
pops up when attempting to delete the stage, explaining that there are
records in the stage which need to be deleted, archived, or moved to a
different stage before deleting.
::::

## Email templates

To communicate with the applicant, Odoo has several pre-configured email
templates that can be used. The pre-configured email templates and when
to use them are as follows:

- `Applicant: Acknowledgement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this
  template is used to let the applicant know that their application was
  received. This email is automatically sent out once the applicant is
  in the `First Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage.
- `Applicant: Interest`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this
  template is used to let the applicant know that they have passed the
  `Initial Qualification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage and
  they will be contacted to set up an interview with the recruiter.
- `Applicant: Not interested anymore`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: this template is used when an applicant communicates
  that they are no longer interested in the position, and thanks them
  for their time and consideration.
- `Applicant: Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this template
  is used when an applicant is no longer being considered for the
  position.
- `Applicant: Your Salary Package`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  this template is used when offering an applicant a position. This
  informs the applicant they can configure their salary package.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Email templates can be created, modified, and deleted to suit the needs
of a business. For more information on email templates, refer to the
`../general/companies/email_template`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
document.
::::

To manually send an email click `Send message`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the chatter. A text box appears, as well as the
applicant\'s email address. Click the
`⤢ (double arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} full composer icon
in the bottom right corner of the `Send Message`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab in the chatter.

![Send an email from the chatter.](recruitment/full-composer.png){.align-center}

An email composer pop-up loads, with the `Recipients`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Subject`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
pre-populated. The applicant\'s email address is entered on the
`Recipients`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} line, and the
`Subject`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is [Re: (Subject /
Application Name)]{.title-ref}. The email body is empty by default.

To use a pre-configured email template, click the drop-down next to the
`Load template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field in the lower
right section of the window. Pre-configured email templates may contain
dynamic placeholders so unique information can be populated in the email
for a more personalized message to the applicant. There are several
pre-configured email templates to choose from. Depending on the template
selected, the email subject and/or body may change.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Only the email templates that are configured for the model will load.
There are other email templates pre-configured in Odoo, but if they are
not configured for the recruitment application, they will not appear in
the list of available templates.
::::

If any attachments are to be added, click the
`Attach A File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the lower
left corner. Navigate to the file to be attached, then click
`Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to attach it. To delete an
attachment, click the `X (Delete)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon to the right of the attachment. If any changes need to be made to
the email, edit the body of the email. If the edits should be saved to
be used in the future, the email can be saved as a new template. Click
the `Save As New Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in
the bottom right corner. To send the email, click
`Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the email will be sent to
the applicant. The email then appears in the chatter.

## Stage flow

In order to move an applicant\'s card from one stage to another, the
applicant\'s card can either be dragged and dropped in the kanban view
to the desired stage, or the stage can be modified on the applicant\'s
card.

To change the stage on the applicant\'s card, click on the applicant\'s
card in the kanban view to go to a detailed view of the card. The
current stage for the card is highlighted in purple at the top, above
the card. Simply click the desired stage for the card, and the stage
changes. A log note indicating the stage change appears in the chatter.
Navigate back to the kanban view by clicking on
`Applications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the breadcrumb menu
in the top left, and the applicant\'s card now appears in the new stage.

![Change the stage of an applicant by clicking on the desired stage at the top of the
applicant\'s card.](recruitment/stage-change.png){.align-center}

### Initial qualification {#recruitment/initial-qualification}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

The following information is based on Odoo\'s default recruitment
pipeline flow. Be advised that if modifications are made to create a
customized recruitment pipeline flow, it will vary from the following
information.
::::

All applicants appear in the `Initial Qualification`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} stage, whether submitted online or if the applicant is
manually entered by a recruiter. When the applicant\'s card is created,
Odoo automatically populates the applicant\'s `Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Email address`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and `Phone number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
applicant\'s card. This information is required when applying for a job
position.

If the applicant entered any information in the
`Short Introduction`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
online application, it is populated in the
`Application Summary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab at the
bottom of the applicant\'s card. If a resumé was attached to the online
application, the resumé appears in the attachments section of the
chatter, and is also stored in the *Documents* application. To find the
recruitment documents stored in the Documents application, navigate to
the main `Documents`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} dashboard,
and click the folder labeled `Recruitment`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the right side. All recruitment documents will be
stored within that folder.

#### Send interview

At any point in the hiring process, an *interview* can be sent to the
applicant to obtain more information. These interviews are custom-made,
and can be formatted in a variety of ways.

Odoo uses the term *interview*, but these can be thought of as
questionnaires, surveys, tests, certifications, etc. Custom interviews
can be formatted to suit each individual job position\'s needs. For
example, a job position for a computer programmer could have an
interview in the form of a programming quiz to determine the skill level
of the applicant. A job position for a restaurant server could have a
questionnaire inquiring about the applicant\'s availability, if the
desired applicant needs to be available on weekend evenings. For more
information on creating and editing interview forms, refer to the
`../hr/recruitment/new_job`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} documentation.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In order to send an email to an applicant, there must be an email
address on the applicant\'s card. If an email address is not entered on
the applicant\'s card, when `Send Interview`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is clicked, the applicant\'s card appears instead of
the `Survey`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window. Enter the
email address in the email field, then click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Once the applicant\'s card is saved, the applicant\'s
card closes and the `Survey`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window appears.
::::

To send an interview to an applicant, click on an applicant\'s card to
navigate to a detailed view of the applicant\'s card. At the top of the
applicant\'s card, click the button labeled `Send
Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

If the applicant\'s card has an email address on file, a
`Survey`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears, with
all the information populated. If an email is not on the applicant\'s
card, then a contact form appears. Enter the applicants email address,
then click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The card closes
and the `Survey`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears.

Odoo refers to the interview forms as *surveys*. These email templates
also use dynamic placeholders to personalize the email to the applicant
and the job position. Add any additional recipients for the survey if
more people should receive the email. If an email is in the database as
a contact, add that contact on the `Recipients`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} line. If an email should be sent to someone who is not
in the database as a contact, and they should **not** be added as a
contact, add their email to the `Additional emails`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} line.

If any attachments need to be added, click the
`Attachments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button and a file
explorer window appears. Navigate to the desired file, then click
`Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to attach it to the email. The
attachment loads, and is listed above the
`Attachments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

If the emailed interview must be completed by a specific date, select a
date for the `Answer deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
lower-right area of the pop-up window. Click on the line next to
`Answer deadline`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and a calendar
selector appears. Use the `< (left)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and `> (right)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} arrows on either side
of the month to navigate to the desired month, then click on the
`day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to select the date.

The `Mail template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field is
pre-populated based on the configuration for the interview. A different
template can be chosen from the drop-down menu if desired. If a new
template is selected, the new email template loads in the email body.

To send the email with the interview link to the applicant, click
`Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} at the bottom of the email
pop-up.

#### Refuse

At any point in the recruitment pipeline, an applicant can be refused
from the job application process. To refuse an applicant, click on an
applicant\'s card to navigate to a detailed view of the applicant\'s
card. At the top of the applicant\'s card, there are several buttons.
Click the one labeled `Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

A `Refuse Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up appears.
Select the `Refuse Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
drop-down menu. The default refuse reasons in Odoo are:
`Doesn't fit the job requirements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`The applicant is not interested anymore`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `The applicant gets a better
offer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. These three refusal reasons
have pre-configured email templates associated with them. Additional
refusal reasons can be created and existing ones can be modified or
deleted. To add a new refusal reason, type in the name of the reason,
then click `Create and Edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. A
`Create: Refuse Reason`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window
appears. Type in the name of the new email template in the
`Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and click
`Create and Edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. A
`Create: Email Template`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window
loads. Configure the new email template, then click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Pre-configured email templates in Odoo sometimes use dynamic
placeholders, which are customized pieces of data that populate dynamic
content. For example, if the applicant\'s name is a piece of dynamic
content, the applicant\'s name will appear anytime that dynamic
placeholder appears on the email template. For more detailed information
on email templates, refer to the
`../general/companies/email_template`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation.
::::

An email template populates the `Email Template`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field after a refusal reason is selected. If an email
should not be sent to the applicant, uncheck the
`Send Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox. To view the
email template, click the `External Link`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon to the right of the email template selected. The
email template loads in the pop-up window, and can be modified if
needed. After making modifications, click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. To close the email template, click
`Discard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To send the refusal email to the applicant, click
`Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The refusal email is sent to
the applicant, and a `Refused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner
appears on the applicant\'s card.

![An applicant\'s card with the refused banner appearing in the top right corner in red.](recruitment/refuse.png){.align-center}

After refusal, the applicant\'s card is no longer visible in the job
position\'s kanban view. To view refused applicants, navigate to the
`Recruitment app --> Applications --> All
Applications`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. All applications
for all job positions are presented in a list view. To view the refused
applicants only, click `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
then click `Archived/Refused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. All
applicants that have been archived and/or refused appear in the list. To
further organize this list and view refusals by job position, click
`≣ Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then click
`Job`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

#### New applicant

An applicant card can be manually added if needed. If an applicant needs
to be added to the list of prospective candidates and an applicant card
has not been created yet (they have not applied for the job online yet)
an applicant card can be easily added from the job position kanban view
in one of two ways, using either the
`Quick add <recruitment/quick-add-applicant>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} icon or the
`Create <recruitment/create-new-applicant>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} button.

##### Quick add {#recruitment/quick-add-applicant}

Quickly add a new applicant using the `Quick add`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon. If not already in the job position kanban view,
navigate to the main recruitment dashboard, and click the
`New Applicants`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the job
position card that the applicant should be added to. Then, click on the
small `+ (plus sign) Quick add`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon
in the top right of the `Initial Qualification`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} stage to quickly add a new applicant.

  changed by selecting a different position from the drop-down menu. If
  a different job position is selected, after the card is created, the
  card will appear in the selected job position.

After the information is entered, click `Add`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The applicant appears in the list, and a new blank
applicant card appears. Click either the `🗑️ (delete)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon or click anywhere on the screen to close the card.

If preferred, after entering the applicant name, click
`Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a detailed

position card that the applicant should be added to. Then, click the
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the top left of
the kanban view and an applicant form loads.

Certain fields on the applicant card may be pre-populated, depending on
how the job position is configured. Typically, the

When the applicant\'s card moves to the
`First Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage, an
acknowledgement email is automatically sent to the applicant. The email
is created using an email template titled
`Applicant: Acknowledgement`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This
email template is pre-configured in Odoo, and contains dynamic
placeholders for the job position, the recruiter\'s name, and the
company\'s information. Once the email is sent, the email appears in the
chatter.

#### Schedule a meeting {#recruitment/schedule-meetings}

interviewer, the interview can be scheduled. To schedule an interview,
whether a phone or in-person interview, click the
`Meeting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at the top of
the applicant\'s record.

The applicant\'s card can be found by navigating to the

The meeting smart button will display `No Meeting`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} if no meetings are currently scheduled. For new
applicants who are new to the `First Interview`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} stage, this will be the default. If there are any
meetings already scheduled, the smart button will display
`Next Meeting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} with the date of the
upcoming meeting.
::::

Doing so loads the *Calendar* application, showing the currently
scheduled meetings and events for the user. The meetings and events
displayed are for the employees who are listed under the
`Attendees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section on the right side
of the calendar view. To change the currently loaded meetings and events
being displayed, uncheck the person who\'s calendar events are to be
hidden. Only the checked attendees will be visible on the calendar.

The default view is the week view. To change the calendar view, click on
a button to present the calendar in a different view, either
`Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Month`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or `Year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To
change the displayed date range for the calendar, either use the

When the applicant\'s card moves to the
`Second Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage, there are
no automatic activities or emails configured for this stage, unlike for
the `First Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage. The
recruiter can now
`schedule a second interview <recruitment/schedule-meetings>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} with the applicant, following the same process as for the
first interview.

### Contract proposal {#recruitment/contract-proposal}

When the applicant has passed the interview stages and an offer is ready

drop the applicant\'s card to the `Contract Proposal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} stage, or click on the
`Contract Proposal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage button at
the top right of the individual applicant\'s card.

The next step is to send an offer to the applicant. On the applicant\'s
card, click the `Generate Offer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button. A `Generate a Simulation Link`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up appears. All fields are pre-populated with

[0.00]{.title-ref}).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Not all fields may appear on the
`Generate a Simulation Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up.
Depending on the localization setting for the company and the
applications installed, some fields may not appear. For example if the
*Fleet* application is not installed, the fields related to vehicles
will not appear on the pop-up.

  `day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to select the date.
- `Yearly Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the annual salary
  being offered.
- `Offer Link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this link takes the
  applicant to a webpage where they can enter their personal
  information, which will be imported to their employee record when
  created. If applicable, the applicant can modify their salary package
  (this option is not available for all localizations). Lastly, this is
  where the applicant accepts the offer by clicking
  `Review Contract & Sign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to accept
  the contract and sign it using the *Sign* application.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The *Sign* application must be installed in order for a document to be
signed. Ensure the *Sign* application is installed to use this feature.
::::

#### Optional fields

The following fields will only appear if specific localization settings
are selected, and/or certain applications are installed. For example if
the *Fleet* application is not installed, none of the optional fields
related to vehicles will appear, such as
`Force New Cars List`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Default Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the official title
  of the job being offered to the applicant, from the
  `Job Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} card. To modify the
  name, click the `External link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  icon to the right of the drop-down arrow. Make any changes, then click
  `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the department the
  job position falls under. To modify the department, click the
  `External link`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the right
  of the drop-down arrow. Make any changes, then click
  `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
- `Force New Cars List`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: check this
  box to offer a new vehicle to the applicant.
- `Default Vehicle`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: using the
  drop-down menu, select the vehicle that will be assigned to the
  applicant.
- `Canteen Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the amount
  that is offered to the applicant for the cafeteria.
- `Contract Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: using the
  drop-down menu, select the type of contract that is being offered.

![Format the offer to send to the applicant. Make any modifications before sending.](recruitment/generate-link.png){.align-center}

#### Send offer

To send the offer to the applicant, click `Send`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. If the applicant does not have an email address listed
on their applicant card, the applicant form appears so their email can
be configured. If there is already an email configured on the
applicant\'s card, the email pop-up appears instead. If prompted with
the applicant\'s card, enter the applicant\'s email address in the
`Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, then click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The applicant form closes and
the email pop-up appears.

The `Applicant: Your Salary Package`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
email template is used, and the `Recipients`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Subject`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
email body are pre-populated based on the email template. If any
attachments need to be added, click the `Attachments`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button and a file explorer window appears. Navigate to
the desired file, then click `Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to attach it to the email. The attachment loads, and is listed above the
`Attachments`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. Once the email
is ready to send, click `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To send an offer, ensure the *Sign* application is installed. This is
necessary so the offer can be sent to the applicant by the recruiter.
The applicant does not need any software installed.
::::

![Send an email to the applicant with a link to the offered salary.](recruitment/send-offer.png){.align-center}

### Contract signed {#recruitment/contract-signed}

Once the applicant has accepted the offer and signed the contract, the
next step is to move the applicant to the
`Contract Signed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage. To move the
applicant to the next stage, drag and drop the applicant\'s card to the
`Contract Signed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage, or click the
`More`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top of the
applicant\'s card to reveal the `Contract
Signed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage button at the top of
the individual applicant\'s card, and click `Contract
Signed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The `Contract Signed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage is folded
in the kanban view, but the card may still be dragged and dropped into
that stage.

Once the applicant\'s card moves to the
`Contract Signed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} stage, a green
`Hired`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} banner appears in the top
right of the applicant\'s card.

![Hired banner in the top right corner of applicant card.](recruitment/hired.png){.align-center}

#### Create employee

Once the applicant has been hired, the next step is to create an
employee record of them. On the applicant\'s card, click the
`Create Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button in the top
left. An employee form appears, and any information from the
applicant\'s card that can be imported into the employee card appears in
the form.

Fill out the rest of the form. For detailed information on the fields,
refer to the `employees/new_employee`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation. When done, click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The employee record is now saved in the *Employees*
app.

# Share job positions

In Odoo *Referrals*, users can earn referral points by sharing job
positions with potential applicants. Job positions can be shared in
several ways, through the `View Jobs
<referrals/view-jobs>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} button and the
`Email A Friend <referrals/email-jobs>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
button, located at the bottom of the *Referrals* app dashboard.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Sharing jobs can **only** occur after onboarding slides have been viewed
or skipped.
::::

## View Jobs {#referrals/view-jobs}

To see all job positions that are actively recruiting candidates, click
the `View Jobs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the main
*Referrals* dashboard. This presents all job positions, with each
individual job presented with its own card.

![The \'View Jobs\' screen, displaying all current open job positions. All information is
displayed on the card.](share_jobs/jobs.png){.align-center}

Each job position card contains the following information:

- The title of the job position. This information is taken from the *Job
  Position* field of the job form.
- The number of `Open Positions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  being recruited. This information is taken from the *Expected New
  Employees* field of the *Recruitment* tab of the job form.
- The points a user earns when an applicant applies for the position.
- The job description detailing the job position. This information is
  taken from the *Job Position* tab of the job form.

To see all the details for a job position, click the
`More Info`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the specific
card. This opens the job position webpage in a new browser tab. This is
what an applicant sees before applying for a position.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Only published job positions are visible in the *Referrals* app. To
check which job positions are published or not, refer to the
`../recruitment/new_job`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} documentation.
::::

## Refer friends

To share a job position with someone, click the
`Refer Friend`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the specific
job position card. A pre-configured
`Send Job Offer by Mail`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up
window appears. Enter the recipient\'s email address in the
`Email`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

The `Subject`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Body`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} are populated using a default
template. The `Subject`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} [Job for
you]{.title-ref} is present, by default, but can be modified, if
desired.

The specific title of the job position populates the *Job Position*
placeholder in the email body. The [See Job Offer]{.title-ref} text in
the email body is an individualized tracking link to the specific job
position listed on the website.

When the prospective employee receives the email, the link sends them to
the job position page, where they can apply for the position, and the
person who referred them is tracked in the *Referrals* application.

If desired, add any text or closing salutation to the email body. When
all edits have been made, click `Send Mail`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to send the email, or click `Cancel`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to close the pop-up window.

![Referral email pop-up window with the email message inside it.](share_jobs/email.png){.align-center}

## Share a job

Other than sending an email, job positions can be shared, via social
media platforms, and by tracking links to the job position. At the
bottom of each job position card are four icons, and corresponding
tracking links, that can be used to share the job position, keeping
track of applicants in the *Referrals* application.

![The various sharing icons that appear for each job.](share_jobs/share.png){.align-center}

### Link

To share the job position with a customized tracking link, click the
`Share Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button with the
`fa-chain`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(link)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon above it. A `Link to Share`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears with the tracking link. Click
`Copy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to copy the link. After the
link is copied, click the `Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button to close the pop-up window. Next, share the link with the
prospective employee.

### Facebook

To share the job position using Facebook, click the
`Share Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button with the
`fa-facebook`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(Facebook)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon above it.

If the user is already logged into Facebook, when the the
`Share Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is clicked, a
`Share on Facebook`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page loads in a
new tab, with the link populated in the main body of the new post in a
pop-up window. If the user is *not* already logged in, a log-in screen
loads, instead, prompting the user to log-in to Facebook first.

Type in any additional information to add to the post, then share the
job position using the available options in Facebook.

### X (formerly Twitter)

A job position can also be shared on X. Click the
`Share Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button with the
`(X)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon above it.

If the user is already signed-in to X, when the
`Share Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is clicked, an X
page loads in a new tab with a pre-populated message ready to post, in a
draft pop-up window. If the user is *not* already signed-in, a sign-in
screen loads instead, prompting the user to first sign-in to X.

The default message is:

[Amazing job offer for (Job Position)! Check it live: (link to Job
Position)]{.title-ref}

Type in any additional information, or make any edits to the message,
then share using the available options in X.

### LinkedIn

To share a job position on LinkedIn, click the
`Share Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button with the
`fa-linkedin`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(LinkedIn)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon above it.

If the user is already logged into LinkedIn, when the
`Share Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button is clicked, a new
tab loads in LinkedIn, with a link to the job position at the top. If
the user is *not* already logged in, a log-in screen loads instead,
prompting the user to log-in to LinkedIn first.

The job position can be shared either in a public post, or in a private
message to an individual (or group of individuals).

Type in any additional information, or make any edits to the message or
post, then share using the available options in LinkedIn.

### Email a friend {#referrals/email-jobs}

Another way to share job opportunities is to share the entire current
list of open job positions, instead of one job position at a time. To do
this, navigate to the `Referrals`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} main dashboard. Click the
`Email a friend`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the bottom
of the screen. A `Send Job Offer by Mail`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears.

Enter the email address in the `Email`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. The email can be sent to multiple recipients by
separating each email address with a comma followed by a single space.
The `Subject`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is pre-configured with
`Job for you`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, but can be edited.

The email `Body`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is also populated
with pre-configured text. The text that appears is:

[Hello,]{.title-ref}

[There are some amazing job offers in my company! Have a look, they can
be interesting for you:]{.title-ref}

[See Job Offers]{.title-ref}

The `See Job Offers`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} text is a
tracking link to a complete list of all job positions currently being
recruited for. Add any additional text and make any edits to the message
body, if necessary. Then, click `Send Mail`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to send the email. This sends the message, and closes
the window.

# Referrals

Odoo\'s *Referrals* application is a centralized place where all
information regarding referrals is housed, from points earned, coworkers
hired, and rewards selected. Users can recommend people they know for
job positions, then earn referral points as those people progress
through the recruitment pipeline. Once enough referral points are
earned, they can be exchanged for prizes. The Referrals application
integrates with the *Employees*, *Recruitment*, and *Website*
applications, all of which must be installed in order for the
*Referrals* application to function.

The only configuration needed for the Referrals application after it is
installed are the `rewards <referrals/rewards>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}; everything else is pre-configured when Odoo Referrals is
installed.

Any user with either `Referral User`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Officer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} rights for the
Recruitment application has access to the Referrals application. Only
user\'s with `Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} rights
for the Recruitment application have access to the `reporting
<referrals/reporting>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and configurations
menus. For more information on users and access rights, refer to these
documents: `../general/users`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
`../general/users/access_rights`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

## Onboarding

When opening the *Referrals* application for the first time, a
pre-configured onboarding script appears. This is in the form of four
slides, each explaining the different parts of the Referrals
application. At the top of the dashboard, the following message is
displayed throughout all the onboarding slides:
`GATHER YOUR TEAM! Job Referral Program`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Behind this main message is an image, and beneath it
some more explanatory text.

Each of the onboarding slides has a corresponding image and message that
is displayed. After reading each message, click the
`Next`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to advance to the next
slide.

The text that appears on each slide is as follows:

1.  `Oh no! Villains are lurking the city! Help us recruit a team of superheroes to save
    the day!`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
2.  `Browse through open job positions, promote them on social media, or refer friends.`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}
3.  `Collect points and exchange them for awesome gifts in the shop.`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}
4.  `Compete against your colleagues to build the best justice league!`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The onboarding slides will appear every time the Referrals application
is opened, until all the slides have been viewed and the
`Start Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button has been clicked.
If the onboarding is exited at any point, or if the
`Start Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button has *not* been
clicked, the onboarding slides will begin again when the Referrals
application is opened. Once the `Start Now`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button has been clicked, the onboarding slides will not
be seen again, and the main dashboard will load when the Referrals
application is opened from that point on.
::::

At any point during onboarding, the `Skip`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button may be clicked. This exits the onboarding, and
the main Referrals dashboard loads. If `Skip`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is clicked, onboarding slides will not load anymore
when opening the Referrals application.

![An onboarding slide with the skip and next buttons visible at the bottom.](referrals/onboarding.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If there are any candidates hired that the user had referred prior to
opening the Referrals app (meaning the onboarding slides have not
appeared before), when `Start Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
clicked at the end of onboarding, instead of going to the main
dashboard, a `hired
<referrals/hired>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} screen appears instead.
::::

### Modifying onboarding slides

Onboarding slides can be modified if desired. Only users with
`Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} rights for the
Recruitment application can modify onboarding slides. To edit a slide,
navigate to
`Referrals app --> Configuration --> Onboarding.`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} Each line displays the text for the individual
onboarding slide. To edit an onboarding slide, click on an individual
slide line to open the slide\'s onboarding form, then click
`Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Make any changes to the message in the `Text`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} box. To change the order the slide appear in the
onboarding, the `Sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be
modified. Type in the corresponding number to indicate the order in
which the slides should be displayed. A `Company`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} may be selected, however, if this field is populated,
that slide will only be displayed for that particular company.

The image can be modified as well. Hover over the image thumbnail in the
top right corner of the form. A `✏️ (pencil)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon and `🗑️ (garbage can)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon appear. Click the `✏️ (pencil)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon to change the image. A file navigator window
loads. Navigate to the desired image, select it, then click
`Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The new image appears in the
thumbnail. To delete an image, click the
`🗑️ (garbage can)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, then select
a new image using the `✏️ (pencil)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
icon.

To save any changes, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
click `Discard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to delete any changes
and revert to the original content.

![An onboarding slide in edit mode, with the main fields highlighted.](referrals/edit-onboarding.png){.align-center}

The order of the slides can also be changed directly in the Onboarding
dashboard, without having to edit an individual onboarding slide. Click
the up and down arrow symbol that appears after the checkbox and before
the slide text, and drag the slide to the desired position. The
`Sequence`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} automatically changes on
all the slide\'s onboarding forms, reflecting the new sequence.

![The onboarding slides in a list, with the drag and drop arrows highlighted.](referrals/onboarding-reorder.png){.align-center}

## Hired referrals {#referrals/hired}

When a candidate that has been referred by a user is hired, the user
\"grows their superhero team\" and adds superhero avatars to their
Referrals dashboard.

After a referral has been hired, when the user next opens the Referrals
app, instead of the main dashboard, a hired page loads. The text
`(Referral Name) has been hired! Choose an avatar
for your new friend!`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears.

Below this message are five avatar thumbnails to choose from. If an
avatar has already been assigned to a referral, the thumbnail is greyed
out, and the name the avatar has been chosen for appears beneath the
avatar. Click on an available avatar to select it.

If more than one referral was hired since opening the Referrals
application, after selecting the first avatar, the user is prompted to
select another avatar for the subsequent hired referral. Once all
avatars have been selected, the dashboard loads and all the avatars are
now visible. Mouse over each avatar and their name is displayed above
them.

![The hired screen. A selection of avatars are presented to chose from, with any already
chosen are greyed out.](referrals/avatars.png){.align-center}

### Modify friends

Friend avatars are able to be modified in the same manner that
`levels <referrals/levels>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are modified.
Only users with `Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
rights for the Recruitment application can make modifications to
friends. The pre-configured friends can be seen and modified by
navigating to
`Referrals app --> Configuration --> Friends`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Each friend avatar appears in the
`Dashboard Image`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, and the
corresponding name appears in the `Friend
Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. The default images are
a motley group of hero characters, ranging from robots to dogs.

To modify a friend\'s dashboard image, thumbnail, name, or position,
click on an individual friend to open the referral friend form. Click
`Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to make modifications. Type
the name in the `Friend Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
The name is solely to differentiate the friends in the configuration
menu; the friend\'s name is not visible anywhere else in the Referrals
application.

The `Position`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be set to either
`Front`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Back`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. This determines the position of the friend in relation
to the user\'s super hero avatar. Click the radio button next to the
desired selection, and the friend will appear either in front of or
behind the user\'s avatar when activated.

If desired, both the thumbnail `Image`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and the `Dashboard Image`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} can be modified. Hover over the image being replaced to
reveal a `✏️ (pencil)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and
`🗑️ (garbage can)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon. Click the
`✏️ (pencil)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and a file
explorer window appears. Navigate to the desired image file then click
`Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to select it.

Once all changes have been made, click the `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to save the changes, or click the
`Discard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to revert to the
original information.

![A friend form in edit mode.](referrals/edit-friend.png){.align-center}

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

It is not advised to edit the images. An image file must have a
transparent background in order for it to render properly. Only users
with knowledge about transparent images should attempt adjusting any
images in the Referrals application.

Once an image is changed and the friend is saved, it is **not possible**
to revert to the original image. To revert to the original image, the
Referrals application must be *uninstalled then reinstalled.*
::::

## Referral points

The referral program is based on earning points that are then exchanged
for rewards. On the main Referrals application dashboard, the top
displays a summary of the user\'s current points. The left side of the
summary displays the total points earned, and the right side displays
the points that are available to spend.

To see the various referrals and the points earned for each, click on
one of the buttons directly beneath the avatars. The options are
`Referrals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Ongoing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Successful`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The current number of referrals who are still active in the recruitment
pipeline, and have not yet been hired or refused, appear above the
`Ongoing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. The number of
referrals who have been hired appear above the
`Successful`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. The total number
of referrals (both the ongoing and successful referrals combined) appear
above the `Referrals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

To view the referrals associated with each of the categories,
`Referrals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Ongoing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Successful`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, click on the
corresponding button. All the referrals for that specific category are
displayed.
::::

### My referrals

To see all the referrals (both ongoing and successful) click the
`Referrals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. A
`My Referral`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} window loads. This
screen displays all the referrals, with each referral in its own
referral card.

A successful referral has a green line down the left side of the card,
and displays a `✓ Hired`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} image in the
top right corner of the card. Referrals that are in process display an
`In Progress`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} image in the top right
corner.

Each referral card lists the name of the applicant, the department the
job position is in, the name of the job position, the person responsible
for filling the role (recruiter), and the points earned.

#### Points

The points that can be earned for a referral are the same across all job
positions. Each stage of the recruitment process has corresponding
points assigned to it. The stages listed correspond to the stages
configured in the *Recruitment* application.

On each individual referral card, beneath the points earned is a bar
chart that displays how many points have been earned out of the total
possible points that can be earned if the applicant is hired.

Beneath the bar chart is a list of the various recruitment stages and
the points earned when the referral moves to that stage. If a stage has
been achieved and the points have been earned, a green check mark
appears next to the stage.

::: example
The pre-configured point structure for referrals is as follows:

- `Initial Qualification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: 1 point
- `First Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: 20 points
- `Second Interview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: 9 points
- `Contract Proposal`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: 5 points
- `Contract Signed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: 50 points

The total points earned for a referral that is hired is 85 points.
Modifications of the points earned for each stage is done in the
Recruitment application. Refer to the
`Recruitment <recruitment/modify-stages>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
documentation to modify the points for each stage.
:::

## Rewards {#referrals/rewards}

### Create rewards

The rewards are the only configurations needed when setting up the
Referrals application. Only users with `Administrator`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} rights for the Recruitment application can create or
modify rewards. To add rewards, navigate to
`Referrals app --> Configuration --> Rewards`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Click `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and a reward form loads. Enter the following information on the form:

- `Product Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the name as
  it should appear for the reward.
- `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the amount of points
  required to redeem the reward.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Using the drop-down
  menu, select the company the reward will appear for. If a reward is to
  be used for several companies, each company needs to have a record of
  the reward, with the company listed on the form.
- `Gift Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Select the
  person who will be responsible for procuring and delivering the reward
  to the recipient, using the drop-down menu. This person is alerted
  when the reward is purchased, so they know when to deliver the reward
  to the recipient.
- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Type in the
  description for the reward. This will be visible on the reward card,
  beneath the title.
- `Photo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Add a photo of the reward,
  which appears on the rewards page. Hover over the image square, and
  two icons appear, a `✏️ (pencil)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  and a `🗑️ (garbage can)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click the
  `✏️ (pencil)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and a file
  explorer appears. Navigate to the photo file, then click
  `Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to select it.

The only required fields are the `Product Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![A filled out reward form with all details entered.](referrals/rewards.png){.align-center}

:::: important
::: title
Important
:::

It is advised to enter a `Cost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
add a `Photo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. If a cost is not
entered, the default cost will be listed as zero, which would list the
reward as free in the reward shop. If a photo is not selected, a
placeholder icon will be displayed on the rewards page.
::::

### Redeem rewards

To redeem points for a reward, click the `Rewards`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on the main Referrals dashboard. All the
configured rewards are listed in individual reward cards. The points
required to purchase the reward is listed in the top right corner of the
card. If the user has enough points to purchase a reward, a
`🧺 (basket) Buy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button appears at
the bottom of the reward card. If they do not have enough points for a
reward, the reward card displays `You need another (x) points
to buy this`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} instead of a buy button.

Click the `🧺 (basket) Buy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on
a reward to purchase it. A confirmation pop-up appears, asking if the
user is sure they want to purchase the reward. Click
`OK`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to purchase the item, or
`Cancel`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to close the window and
cancel the purchase.

After `OK`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is clicked, the pop-up
window closes, and the points used to purchase the reward are subtracted
from the user\'s available points. The rewards presented are now updated
to reflect the user\'s current available points.

![Buy button appears below a mug and backpack reward, while the bicycle reward states how
many more reward points are needed to redeem.](referrals/redeem-rewards.png){.align-center}

## Levels {#referrals/levels}

The referrals application has pre-configured levels that are reflected
in the user\'s avatar on the Referrals dashboard. As a user refers
potential employees and earns points, they can *level up*, much like in
a video game.

Levels have no functional impact on the performance of the application.
They are solely used for the purpose of adding achievement tiers for
participants to aim for, gamifying referrals for the user.

The user\'s current level is displayed at the top of the main Referrals
application dashboard, directly beneath their photo, in a
`Level: X`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} format. In addition, a
colored ring appears around the user\'s photo, indicating how many
points the user currently has, and how many additional points they need
to level up. The cyan colored portion of the ring represents points
earned, while the white colored portion represents the points still
needed before they can level up.

### Modify levels

Only users with `Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
rights for the Recruitment application can modify levels. The
pre-configured levels can be seen and modified by navigating to
`Referrals app
--> Configuration --> Levels`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
Each avatar appears in the `Image`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
column, and the corresponding level number appears in the
`Level Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column. The default
images are of Odoo superheroes, and each level adds an additional
element to their avatar, such as capes and shields.

To modify a level\'s image, name, or points required to reach the level,
click on an individual level in the list to open the level form. Click
`Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to make modifications.

Type in the name or number of the level in the
`Level Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. What is entered
is displayed beneath the user\'s photo on the main dashboard when they
reach that level. Enter the number of referral points needed to reach
that level in the `Requirements`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
field. The points needed to level up are the total accumulated points
earned over the lifetime of the employee, not additional points from the
previous level that must be earned.

If desired, the `Image`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can also be
modified. Hover over the image to reveal a
`✏️ (pencil)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and
`🗑️ (garbage can)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon. Click the
`✏️
(pencil)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon and a file explorer
window appears. Navigate to the desired image file then click
`Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to select it.

Once all changes have been made, click the `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to save the changes, or click the
`Discard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to revert to the
original information.

![A level form in edit mode.](referrals/levels.png){.align-center}

:::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

It is not advised to edit the images. An image file must have a
transparent background in order for it to render properly. Only users
with knowledge about transparent images should attempt adjusting any
images in the Referrals application.

Once an image is changed and the level is saved, it is **not possible**
to revert to the original image. To revert to the original image, the
Referrals application must be *uninstalled then reinstalled.*
::::

### Level up

Once enough points have been accumulated to level up, the circle around
the user\'s photo is completely filled in with a cyan color, a large
image stating `Level up!`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} appears
above the photo, and the phrase `Click to level up!`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} appears beneath the user\'s photo and current level.

Click on either the `LEVEL UP!`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
graphic, the user\'s photo, or the text `Click to
level up!`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} beneath the user\'s photo
to level up the user. The user\'s avatar changes to the current level,
and the ring around the photo is updated to indicate the current amount
of points.

Leveling up does not cost the user any points, the user simply needs to
earn the specified amount of points required.

![A \'Click to level up!\' appears beneath the user\'s image, and a large \'Level up!\' appears
above their image.](referrals/level-up.png){.align-center}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Once a user has reached the highest configured level, they will continue
to accrue points that can be redeemed for rewards, but they are no
longer able to level up. The ring around their photo remains solid cyan.
::::

## Alerts

In the Referrals application, it is possible to post a message, also
referred to as an *alert*, at the top of the dashboard to share
important information with users. These alerts appear as a thin
semi-transparent banner, with the word `New!`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} appearing on the far left. The text for the alert is in
the center of the banner, and on the far right side is an
`X`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Alerts appear on the main dashboard for the specified time configured on
the individual alert. If a user does not wish to see a specific alert
again, click the `X`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the far right
side of the alert. This removes the alert from the dashboard and will
not appear again, even when opening the Referrals application for the
first time in a new session.

![Two alert banners appear above the user\'s photo.](referrals/alerts.png){.align-center}

### Create an alert

Only users with `Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
rights for the Recruitment application can create alerts. To add a new
alert, navigate to the `Referrals application --> Configuration -->
Alerts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Click `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and a blank alert form
loads. Enter the following information on the form:

- `Date From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The date the alert
  starts. On this date, the alert will be visible on the dashboard.
- `Date To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The date the alert ends.
  After this date, the alert will be hidden from view.
- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The current company
  populates this field by default. To modify the company the alert
  should be displayed for, select the company from the drop-down menu.
  If this field remains blank, the alert is visible to everyone with
  access to the Referrals application. If a company is specified, only
  user\'s within that company (who also have access to the Referrals
  application) will see the alert.
- `Alert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Enter the text for the
  alert. This message appears inside the alert banner on the main
  dashboard.
- `On Click`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: There are three options
  for the alert. Click the radio button next to the desired selection.
  The options are:
  - `Not Clickable`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The alert only
    displays text, there is no link to click.
  - `Go to All Jobs`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The alert
    contains a link that when clicked, navigates to the website with all
    the currently posted job positions.
  - `Specify URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: The alert contains
    a link to a specific URL, that when clicked, navigates to that URL.
    When selected, a `URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
    appears below the `On
    Click`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section. Enter the URL in
    the field.

![An alert form completely filled in with all selections entered.](referrals/alert-form.png){.align-center}

## Reporting {#referrals/reporting}

Only users with `Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
rights for the Recruitment application have access to the Reporting
feature in Referrals. To access the reports, click
`Referrals application
--> Reporting`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. The main view is
the Reporting Dashboard view, which contains three sections.

In the top portion of the window, the report displays a bar chart of how
many referred candidates are hired, and how many are still in the hiring
pipeline. The candidates are further divided by channel, showing
specifically where the referral came from, such as a direct referral,
Facebook, etc. If a channel does not appear on the report, that
indicates there are no referrals from that particular channel.

The middle third provides all the specific data that has been tracked.
This includes how many total points have been earned across all
referrals, how many applicants were referred, hired, or refused, how
many applicants the current logged-in user referred, how many total
points were earned, and how many points were given for refused
applicants.

The bottom third displays a pivot table. This table can be inserted into
a new or existing spreadsheet. To do so, click the
`Insert in Spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button right
above the chart. A pop-up appears, asking which spreadsheet to insert
the pivot chart into. Select the desired spreadsheet from the drop-down
menu, or select `New Spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
Click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the selected
spreadsheet loads, with the new table in it.

# Time Off

Odoo\'s *Time Off* application is a centralized place, where all time
off information is housed. The *Time Off* app manages everything related
to requests, balances, allocations, approvals, and reports.

Users can
`request time off <time_off/request-time-off>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, managers can `approve time off
requests <time_off/approve-time-off>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`allocate time off <time_off/allocate>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to
individuals, teams, or the whole company,
`reports <time_off/reporting>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} can be run
to see how much time off (and what kinds of time off) are being used,
`accrual plans <time_off/accrual-plans>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
can be created, and
`public holidays <time_off/public-holidays>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} can be set.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Be advised, only users with specific access rights can see all aspects
of the *Time Off* application.

All users can access the `My Time Off`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Overview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
sections of the *Time Off* application. All other sections require
specific access rights.

To better understand how access rights affect the *Time Off*
application, refer to the
`/applications/hr/employees/new_employee`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
document, specifically the section about configuring the work
information tab.
::::

## Configuration

In order to allocate time off to employees, and for employees to request
and use their time off, the various time off types must be configured
first, then allocated to employees (if allocation is required).

### Time off types {#time_off/time-off-types}

To view the currently configured time off types, navigate to
`Time Off application
--> Configuration --> Time Off Types`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. The time off types are presented in a list view.
The *Time Off* application comes with four types of time off
pre-configured: `Paid Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Sick Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Unpaid`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Compensatory Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Any of these may
be modified to suit the needs of the businesses, or can be used as-is.

#### Create time off type

To create a new time off type, navigate to
`Time Off app --> Configuration --> Time
Off Types`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. From here, click the
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to reveal a blank
time off type form.

Enter the name for the particular type of time off in the blank line at
the top of the form, such as [Sick Time]{.title-ref} or
[Vacation]{.title-ref}. Then, enter the following information on the
form:

##### Time off requests section

- `Approval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select what specific
  kind of approval is required for the time off type. The options are:

  - `No Validation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: no approvals are
    required when requesting this type of time off. The time off request
    is automatically approved when requested.
  - `By Time Off Officer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: only the
    specified `Time Off Officer
    <time_off/time-off-officer>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, set on
    this form in the `Responsible Time Off Officer`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field, is required to approve the time off request.
    This option is selected by default.
  - `By Employee's Approver`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: only
    the employee\'s specified approver for time off, which is set on the
    *Work Information* tab on the
    `employee's form <employees/work-info-tab>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, is required to approve the time off request.
  - `By Employee's Approver and Time Off Officer`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}: both the employee\'s `specified
    time off approver<employees/work-info-tab>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and the `Time Off Officer
    <time_off/time-off-officer>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are
    required to approve the time off request.

- `Responsible Time Off Officer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}:
  select the person responsible for approving requests and allocations
  for this specific type of time off.

- `Take Time Off in`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the
  format the time off is requested from the drop-down menu. The options
  are:

  - `Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if time off can only be
    requested in full day increments (8 hours).
  - `Half Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if time off can only
    be requested in half day increments (4 hours).
  - `Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the time off can be
    taken in hourly increments.

- `Deduct Extra Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: tick this box
  if the time off request should factor in any extra time accrued by the
  employee

  ::: example
  For example, if an employee worked two (2) extra hours for the week,
  and requests five (5) hours of time off, the request would be for
  three (3) hours, since the two (2) additionally worked hours are used
  first, and deducted from the request.
  :::

- `Allow To Join Supporting Document`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: tick this box to allow the employee to attach
  documents to the time off request. This is useful in situations where
  documentation is required, such as long-term medical leave.

- `Kind of Leave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select from the
  drop-down menu the type of leave this time off type is, either
  `Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Other`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if multiple companies
  are created in the database, and this time off type only applies to
  one company, select the company from the drop-down menu. If this field
  is left blank, the time off type applies to all companies in the
  database.

##### Allocation requests section

- `Requires allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the time
  off must be allocated to employees, select `Yes`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. If the time off can be requested without time off
  being previously allocated, select `No Limit`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}. If `No Limit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
  selected, the following options do not appear on the form.

- `Employee Requests`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select
  `Extra Days Requests Allowed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} if
  the employee is able to request more time off than was allocated.

  ::: example
  For example, if ten (10) days are allocated to the employee for this
  particular type of time off, and this option is enabled, the employee
  may submit a request for more than ten (10) days.
  :::

  If employees should **not** be able to make requests for more time off
  than what was allocated, select the `Not Allowed`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} option.

- `Approval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the type of
  approval(s) required for the allocation of this particular type of
  time off.

  - `No validation needed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} indicates
    that no approvals are required.
  - `Approved by Time Off Officer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    indicates the `Time Off Officer
    <time_off/time-off-officer>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} set on
    this form must approve the allocation.
  - `Set by Time Off Officer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    indicates that the `Time Off Officer
    <time_off/time-off-officer>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} set on
    this form must allocate the time off.

##### Payroll section

If the time off type should create
`../hr/payroll/work_entries`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} in the
*Payroll* application, select the `Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} from the drop-down list.

##### Timesheets section

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Timesheets`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section only appears
if the user is in developer mode. Refer to the
`developer-mode`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} document for details on
how to access the developer mode.
::::

When an employee takes time off and is also using timesheets, Odoo
creates entries in the timesheet for the time off. This section defines
how they are entered.

- `Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the project that
  the time off type entries appear in.
- `Task`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the task that
  appears in the timesheet for this time off type. The options are:
  `Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Meeting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Training`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

##### Display option section

- `Color`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select a color to be used
  in the *Time Off* application dashboard.
- `Cover Image`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select an icon to be
  used in the *Time Off* application dashboard.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The only required fields on the time off type form are the name of the
`Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Approval`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Responsible Time Off Officer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Take Time Off
in`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Kind of Leave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Allocation Requests`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.
::::

![Time off type form with all the information filled out for sick time off.](time_off/time-off-type-form.png){.align-center}

### Accrual plans {#time_off/accrual-plans}

Some time off is earned through an accrual plan, meaning that for every
specified amount of time an employee works (hour, day, week, etc), they
earn or *accrue* a specified amount of time off.

::: example
If an employee accrues a vacation day for every week they work, they
would earn 0.2 vacation days for each hour they work. At the end of a
forty (40) hour work week, they earn a whole vacation day (8 hours).
:::

#### Create accrual plan

To create a new accrual plan, navigate to
`Time Off app --> Configuration --> Accrual
Plans`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Then, click the
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, which reveals a
blank accrual plan form.

Enter the accrual plan name in the `Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. If the accrual plan only applies to a specific
time off type, select it from the drop-down menu. If this accrual plan
is available for all time off types, leave this field blank.

Next, select how the `Level Transition`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} occurs, either `Immediately`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `After this accrual's period`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. By default, the first level begins once the time off
is approved if the time off is based on an accrual plan. If
`Immediately`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, then the
next level begins according to the time frame set on the level. If
`After this
accrual's period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, the
next level does not begin until the first level is completed according
to the rules set on it.

##### Rules

Rules must be created in order for the accrual plan to accrue time off.

To create a new rule, click the `Add A New Level`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button right beneath the word [Rules]{.title-ref}, and
a `Create Level`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up form appears.

Fill out the following fields on the form:

- `Start after (#) (time period) after allocation date`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: enter the number and value of the time period that
  must pass before the employee starts to accumulate time off. The first
  value is numerical; enter a number in the first field.

  Then, select the type of time period using the drop-down menu in the
  second field. The options are: `day(s)`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `month(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `year(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Based on worked time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: tick this
  box if the accrual of time off is based on the time the employee has
  worked. If an employee takes time off that is *not* considered a
  worked day, Odoo will not count that day towards their accrual plan.

- `Rate (#) (time)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the rate
  of time off that is accumulated. The first value is numerical; enter a
  number in the first field. Whole numbers are not necessary, any
  decimal value may be entered.

  Next, in the second field, select the type of time accrued using the
  drop-down menu. The options are either `Days`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} or `Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Frequency (X)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select how often
  the employee accrues the time off for this rule using the drop-down
  menu. The options are `Daily`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Weekly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Twice a
  month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Monthly`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, `Twice a year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  or `Yearly`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  Depending on the selection, more fields appear to specify exactly when
  the accrual renews.

::: example
If the employee should accrue one vacation day for every week worked,
the `Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to [1]{.title-ref},
and the `Frequency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} entry is set to
[Frequency (Weekly) on (Friday)]{.title-ref}. Only the
`Frequency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Weekday`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields appear.

If the employee should accrue ten (10)vacation days each year, and they
receive these days every year on the first of January, the
`Rate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is set to [10]{.title-ref},
and the `Frequency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} entry is set to
[Frequency (Yearly) on the (1) of (January)]{.title-ref}. The
`Frequency`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Date`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, and `Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields
appear.
:::

- `Limit to`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter a maximum amount
  of days the employee can accrue with this plan.

- `At the end of the calendar year, unused accruals will be`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}: select from the drop-down menu how unused time off
  is handled.

  The options are either
  `Transferred to the next year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  which rolls over unused time to the next calendar year, or
  `Lost`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which means any unused time
  off is gone.

![A level form with all the data filled out.](time_off/new-level.png){.align-center}

When the form is filled out, click `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to save the form and close the pop-up, or
`Save & New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the form and
create a new rule. Add as many levels as desired.

![An accrual form with all the entries filled out.](time_off/accrual-plan-form.png){.align-center}

### Public holidays {#time_off/public-holidays}

Most countries have public or national holidays, and some companies may
have specific days they are closed and/or give extra days as holidays.

It is important to configure these days in Odoo, so employees are aware
of the days they have off, and do not request time off on days that are
already set as a public holiday (non-working days).

#### Create public holiday

To create a public holiday, navigate to
`Time Off app --> Configuration --> Public
Holidays`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

All currently configured public holidays appear in a list view.

Click the `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and a new
line appears at the bottom of the list.

Enter the following information:

- `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the name of the
  holiday.

- `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if in a multi-company
  database, the current company populates this field by default. It is
  not possible to edit this field.

- `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: using the date and
  time picker, select the date and time that the holiday starts. By
  default, this field is configured for the current date. The start time
  is set according to the start time for the company (according to the
  `working times <payroll/working-times>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}). If the user\'s computer is set to a different time zone,
  the start time is adjusted according to the difference in the time
  zone compared to the company\'s time zone.

- `End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: using the date and time
  picker, select the date and time that the holiday ends. By default,
  this field is configured for the current date, and the time is set to
  the end time for the company (according to the
  `working times <payroll/working-times>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}). If the user\'s computer is set to a different time zone,
  the start time is adjusted according to the difference in the time
  zone compared to the company\'s time zone.

  ::: example
  A company is located in San Francisco, and the working times are 9:00
  AM - 6:00 PM (an eight
  \(8\) hour work day with a one (1) hour lunch break). A user is
  located in New York, and their computer time zone is set to Eastern.
  When they create a Public Holiday, the start time appears as 12:00
  PM - 9:00 PM, since the time zone is accounted for. If a different
  user is located in Los Angeles, and their computer time zone is set to
  Pacific, when they create a Public Holiday, the time appears as 9:00
  AM - 6:00 PM.
  :::

- `Working Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the holiday
  should only apply to employees who have a specific set of working
  hours, select the working hours from the drop-down menu. If left
  blank, the holiday applies to all employees.

- `Work Entry Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if using the
  *Payroll* application, this field defines how the work entry for the
  holiday appears. Select the work entry type from the drop-down menu.

![The list of public holidays in the configuration menu.](time_off/holidays.png){.align-center}

## Overview {#time_off/allocate}

To view a color-coded schedule of both the user\'s time off, and/or the
team managed by them, navigate to
`Time Off app --> Overview`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.
This presents a calendar with the default filter of
`My Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, in a month view.

To change the time period displayed, click on either the
`Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Week`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons to present the
calendar in that corresponding view.

Each team member is displayed on a line, and any time off they
requested, regardless of the status (`Validated`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} or `To Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}),
appears on the calendar.

Each employee is color-coded. The employee\'s color is selected at
random and does not correspond to the type of time off they requested.

The status of the time of is represented by the color of the request
either appearing solid (`Validated`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"})
or striped (`To Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}).

The number of days or hours requested is written on the request (if
there is enough space).

At the bottom of the calendar, a bar graph shows how many people are
projected to be out on any given day. The number on the bar represents
the number of employees out for those highlighted days.

Hover over a time off entry to view the details for the specific time
off entry. The total number of hours or days are listed, along with the
start and end time of the time off.

## Allocate time off {#time_off/reporting}

Once time off types and accrual plans have been configured, the next
step is to allocate, or give, time off to employees. This section is
only visible to users who have either `Time Off
Officer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} access rights for the
*Time Off* application.

To create a new allocation, navigate to
`Time Off app --> Approvals --> Allocations`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

This presents a list of all current allocations, including their
respective status.

Click `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to allocate time off,
and a blank allocation form appears.

After entering a name for the allocation on the first blank field of the
form, enter the following information:

- `Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: using the
  drop-down menu, select the type of time off that is being allocated to
  the employees.

- `Allocation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select either
  `Regular Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or `Accrual
  Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Accrual Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if
  `Accrual Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected
  for the `Allocation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
  `Accrual Plan`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears. Using
  the drop-down menu, select the accrual plan with which the allocation
  is associated. An accrual plan **must** be selected for an
  `Accrual Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Validity Period/Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if
  `Regular Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected
  for the `Allocation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, this
  field is labeled `Validity Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  Using the calendar, select the beginning date for the allocation. If
  the allocation expires, select the expiration date in the next date
  field. If the time off does *not* expire, leave the second date field
  blank.

  If `Accrual Allocation`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected
  for the `Allocation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, this
  field is labeled `Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  Using the calendar picker, select the start date for the allocation.
  If the allocation expires, select the expiration date in the
  `Run until`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. If the time off
  does *not* expire, leave the `Run until`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} field blank.

- `Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the amount of
  time that is being allocated to the employees. This field displays the
  time in either `Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Days`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, depending on how the
  selected `Time Off Type <time_off/time-off-types>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} is configured (in days or hours).

- `Mode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: using the drop-down menu,
  select how the allocation is assigned. This selection determines who
  receives the time off allocation. The options are
  `By Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `By Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `By Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `By Employee Tag`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  Depending on what was selected for the `Mode`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"}, this following field is labeled either:
  `Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
  `Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
  `Employee Tag`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  Using the drop-down menu, indicate the specific employees, company,
  department, or employee tags who are receiving this time off.

  Multiple selections can be made for either
  `Employees`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
  `Employee Tag`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

  Only one selection can be made for the `Company`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} or `Department`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

- `Add a reason...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if any
  description or note is necessary to explain the time off allocation,
  enter it in this field at the bottom of the form.

## Request time off {#time_off/request-time-off}

Once an employee has been allocated time off, a request to use the time
off can be submitted. Time off can be requested in one of two ways,
either from the `dashboard <time_off/dashboard>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or from the `My Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
view.

To access the dashboard, navigate to
`Time Off app --> My Time Off --> Dashboard`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. This is also the default view for the *Time Off*
application.

To access `My Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, navigate to
`Time Off app --> My Time Off --> My
Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. This presents a list
view of all the time off requests for the employee.

To create a new request for time off, click either the
`New Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the main
*Time Off* dashboard, or the `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button in the `My Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list
view. Both buttons open a new time off request form.

Enter the following information on the form:

- `Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the type of
  time off being requested from the drop-down menu.

- `Dates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the dates that the
  time off will fall under. There are two fields to populate, the
  `From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `To`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} fields. Click on either the `From`{.interpreted-text
  role="guilabel"} or `To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and
  a calendar pop-up appears.

  Click on the start date, then click on the end date. The selected
  start and end dates appear in deep purple, and the dates between them
  appear in pale purple (if applicable).

  If the time off requested is for a single day, click on the start
  date, then click the same date again for the end date.

  When the correct dates are selected/highlighted, click the
  `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

  The dates now populate the `From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  and `To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} fields.

  - `Half Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the time off
    request is for a half day, tick this box. When this is selected, the
    `From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} date field disappears, and
    is replaced with a drop-down menu. Select either
    `Morning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
    `Afternoon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to indicate which
    half of the day is being requested.
  - `Custom Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the time off
    requested is not a whole or half day, tick this box. A
    `From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and `To`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} field appears beneath this option if selected.
    Using the drop-down menu, select the start and end time for the time
    off request.

- `Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field updates
  automatically once the `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  section is completed. If the `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  section is modified, this section automatically updates to reflect the
  total time off requested. This field is in either hours or days,
  depending on the `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} selections.

- `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter a description
  for the time off request. This should include any details that
  managers and approvers may need in order to approve the request.

- `Supporting Document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field
  only appears if the `Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
  selected allows for the attachments of documents. Click the
  `Attach File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, and a file
  explorer window appears.

  Navigate to the file(s) to attach, then click the
  `Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. The files then
  appear on the time off request form. Multiple documents can be
  attached, if necessary.

When the form is complete, click the `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to save the information, and submit the request.

## Request allocation {#time_off/request-allocation}

If an employee has used all their time off, or is going to run out of
time off, they can request an allocation for additional time.
Allocations can be requested in one of two ways, either from the
`dashboard <time_off/dashboard>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or the
`My Allocations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view.

To access the dashboard, navigate to the
`Time Off app --> My Time Off -->
Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. This is also the
default view for the *Time Off* application.

To access `My Allocations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, navigate
to the `Time Off app --> My Time Off
--> My Allocations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. This
presents a list view of all the allocations for the employee.

To create a new allocation request, click either the
`Allocation Request`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
main *Time Off* dashboard, or the `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button in the `My Allocations`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} list view. Both buttons open a new allocation request
form.

After entering a name for the allocation in the first blank line on the
form, enter the following information:

- `Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the type of
  time off being requested for the allocation from the drop-down menu.
- `Validity Period`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: the current date
  populates the start date by default. If there is no expiration on the
  time off type, there is no date populated as the end date. If the time
  off type has an expiration date, the date automatically populates the
  end date field once the form is saved.
- `Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the amount of
  time being requested. The format (either days or hours) is in the same
  format as the time off type.
- `Add a reason...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter a
  description for the allocation request. This should include any
  details that managers and approvers may need in order to approve the
  request.

When the form is complete, click the `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to save the information, and submit the request.

sick time.](time_off/allocation-request.png){.align-center}

## Approvals

Most requests for time off and allocations need to go through the
approval process, prior to the time off being allocated, and then
granted to an employee. Requests either need one or two approvals,
depending on how the specific type of time off is configured.

Only users who can approve allocation and time off requests have the
`Approvals`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section visible in the
*Time Off* application.

### Approve allocations

To view allocations that need approval, navigate to
`Time Off app --> Approvals -->
Allocations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. The only
allocations visible on this list are for employees the user has either
`Time Off Officer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} access rights for in
the *Time Off* application.

The default filters that are configured to be in place when navigating
to the `Allocations`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list are
`My Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Active Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This *only*
presents employees on the user\'s team (who they manage) and active
employees. Inactive users are not shown.

The left side of the screen has various grouping options to narrow down
the presented allocation requests.

The options are `To Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`To Submit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Refused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To view all allocation requests, click `All`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

It is also possible to display allocation requests by department. Click
on the department to only present allocations for that specific
department.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The groupings on the left side only present allocation requests that
fall under the default filters of `My Team`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and `Active Employee`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Only the statuses for allocation requests that fall
under those filters are presented on the left side.

For example, if there are no requests with a status of
`To Submit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, that status option does
not appear in the left-hand side.

All departments for the user\'s employees appear in the list. If there
are no allocation requests that fall under that department matching the
pre-configured filters, the list is blank.

It is always possible to remove any of the pre-configured filters, by
clicking the `✖️
(remove)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon on the specific filter
to remove it.
::::

The status column displays the status of each request, with the status
highlighted in a specific color.

The `To Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} requests are
highlighted in yellow, `Approved`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
requests are highlighted in green, `To Submit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} (drafts) requests are highlighted in blue, and the
`Refused`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} requests are highlighted in
gray.

To approve an allocation request, click `✔ Validate`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} at the end of the line, to refuse a request, click
`✖️ Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Allocations with the filter, groupings, and status sections highlighted.](time_off/allocations.png){.align-center}

If more details are needed, click anywhere on the allocation request
line (except for `✔
Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`✖️ Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) to view the request in
detail.

Depending on the rights of the user, changes can be made on the
allocation request form that appears. To modify the request, click the
`Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, make any desired
changes, then click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

It is also possible to approve or refuse the request from this form.
Click the `Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
approve, or the `Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
refuse the request.

### Approve time off {#time_off/approve-time-off}

To view time off requests that need approval, navigate to
`Time Off app --> Approvals
--> Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. The only time off
requests visible on this list are for employees the user has either
`Time Off Officer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Administrator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} access rights for the
*Time Off* application.

The default filters in the `Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
list are `To Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `My
Team`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Active Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Active Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. This only presents
time off requests that need to be approved for current employees on the
user\'s team, for requests that are active and *not* in a draft mode.

The left side of the screen has various grouping options to narrow down
the presented time off requests. Since only time off requests that need
to be approved are shown, the only status options are
`All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`To Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To view requests with other statuses, first remove the
`To Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter, by clicking the
`✖️ (remove)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon next to the
`To Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter to remove it.

To display time off requests for specific departments, click on the
department on the left-hand side. Only requests within the selected
department are then presented.

The status column displays the status of each request, with the status
highlighted in a specific color.

The `To Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} requests are
highlighted in yellow, and are the only ones that appear in the list by
default. If the `To Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter
is removed, then all statuses appear. `Approved`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} requests are highlighted in green,
`To Submit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (drafts) requests are
highlighted in blue, and the `Refused`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} requests are highlighted in gray.

To approve a time off request, click `👍 Approve`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} at the end of the line, to refuse a request, click
`✖️ Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

![Time off requests with the filter, groupings, and status sections highlighted.](time_off/time-off-requests.png){.align-center}

If more details are needed, click anywhere on the time off request line
(except for `👍
Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`✖️ Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) to load the time off
request form. Depending on the rights of the user, changes can be made.

To modify the request, click the `Edit`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, make any desired changes, then click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

It is also possible to approve or refuse the request from this form.
Click the `Approve`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
approve, or the `Refuse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
refuse the request.

## My time off

The `My Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the
*Time Off* application contains the time off dashboard, as well as the
user\'s time off requests and allocations.

### Dashboard {#time_off/dashboard}

All users have access to the time off dashboard, which is the default
view in the *Time Off* application. The dashboard can also be accessed
at any point in the application by navigating to
`Time Off app --> My Time Off --> Dashboard`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

The current year is displayed, and the current day is highlighted in
red.

To change the view, click on the desired button at the top. The options
are `Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Week`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Month`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} (the default).

To change the presented dates, click the left and right arrows on either
side of the `Today`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. The
calendar view adjusts in increments of the presented view.

For example, if `Week`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected,
the arrows adjust the view by one week.

To change the view at any point to a view that includes the current
date, click the `Today`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

Above the calendar view is a summary of the users time off balances.
Every time off type that has been allocated appears in its own summary
box. Each summary lists the type of time off, the corresponding icon,
the current available balance (in hours or days), and an expiration date
(if applicable).

The legend on the right side of the calendar view displays the various
time off types, with their corresponding colors. The status of the time
off requests are shown as well.

Time off that has been validated appears in a solid color (in the color
specified in the Time Off Types part of the legend). Time off requests
that still need to be approved appear with white stripes in the color.
Refused time off requests have a colored line through the dates.

New time off requests can be made from the dashboard. Click the
`New Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top of
the dashboard, and a new
`time off form <time_off/request-time-off>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} appears.

New allocation requests can also be made from the dashboard. Click the
`Allocation
Request`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the top of the
dashboard to request more time off, and a new `allocation
form <time_off/request-allocation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
appears.

### My time off

To view a list of all the user\'s time off requests, navigate to
`Time Off app --> My
Time Off --> My Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. Here,
all time off requests appear in a list view, both past and present.

Other than the employee\'s name, the list includes the following
information for each request: the `Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

A new time off request can be made from this view. Click the
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
`request time off <time_off/request-time-off>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### My allocations

To view a list of all the users allocations, navigate to
`Time Off app --> My Time
Off --> My Allocations`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. All
allocations and requested allocations appear in a list view.

The information presented includes: the
`Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Allocation Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the

A new allocation request can be made from this view, as well. Click the
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
`request an allocation <time_off/request-allocation>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

## Reporting

The reporting feature allows users to view time off for their team,
either by employee or type of time off. This allows users to see which
employees are taking time off, how much time off they are taking, and
what time off types are being used.

### By employee

To view a report of employee time off requests, navigate to
`Time Off app -->
Reporting --> by Employee`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

The default report is a stacked bar chart with the filters of
`Active Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in place.

Each employee is displayed in their own column, with the bar displaying
how many days of each type of time off type they requested.

The report can be displayed in other ways. Click the various options at
the top of the report to view the data differently.

The graph options are `Bar Chart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Line Chart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Pie Chart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
`Bar Chart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} includes an option to
present the data `Stacked`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Both the
`Bar Chart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Line Chart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} have options to present
the data in either `Descending`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Ascending`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} order.

### By type

To view a list of approved time off, organized by time off type,
navigate to `Time
Off app --> Reporting --> by Type`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. This shows each time off type in its own section.

Click on a time off type to expand the list. Each request is listed,
with the following information displayed: the
`Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},

`Start Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`End Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

The default filters in place for this report are
`Approved Requests`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Active
Employee`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, the
`Current Year`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and the
`Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

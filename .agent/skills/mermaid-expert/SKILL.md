# Mermaid & Architectural Visualization

## 1. Visual Standards

- **Clarity First**: Avoid overcrowding. Use consistent colors and meaningful labels.
- **Mastery**: graph (flowchart), sequenceDiagram, erDiagram, stateDiagram-v2, classDiagram, gantt.

## 2. C4 Architecture Integration

- **Context (Level 1)**: System users and external dependencies.
- **Container (Level 2)**: Main applications and database technologies.
- **Component (Level 3)**: Key modules within an application (e.g., Odoo models/controllers).
- **Code (Level 4)**: Class relationships and detail logic (rarely needed).

## 3. Professional Output

- Always provide valid Mermaid code.
- Include comments for complex logic.
- Offer both "Basic" and "Styled" versions for documentation.
